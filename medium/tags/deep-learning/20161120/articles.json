        "text": "With the recent demonetization initiative in India where currency of higher denominations became invalid, banks scaled up to handle huge demand from customers for cash transactions and deposits. Given the current scenario there have been a large number of customer complaints and also several instances of goodwill shared by customers with the banks, complimenting them for the great service. The key question is, can we automatically analyze this feedback and use them to improve the service?\n\nText categorization of tweets is a challenging problem. This is due to several reasons that include:\n\nThe above is a small sampling of the real challenges! Due to such a nature of tweets analysis, even the industry grade products that perform sentiment characterization have only a limited accuracy.\n\nOur intention is to apply the cutting edge techniques we developed in to performing this complex task and accomplish a decent degree of accuracy. The demo is hosted at: http://jnresearchlabs.com:9027/#\u00a0. This demo showcases our innovative technique that performs high accuracy text categorization.\n\nThe Table 1 shows the performance of banks as analyzed based on customer tweets. The tweets are categorized as (Displeasure, Miscellaneous, Compliment) and each tweet is assigned a weight of (0, 5, 10). The performance index is computed as the weighted sum.\n\nThe Table 2 shows the actual tweets (refreshed every 3 mins) and the categorization.\n\nThis is intended as a basic demo, I might add a few more graphics (such as trend graphs, heat maps etc) later. Please do have a look\u00a0:)",

        "text": "Music is one of the constants in my life, and it has been for as long as I can remember. I play, and sometimes make, music, but more than anything else I listen to music.\n\nI listen to music when I work, when I travel, when I read. The soundtrack makes or breaks the experience for me when watching shows and movies. The highlight of watching a new episode of The O.C. more than a decade back was checking out the bands that were featured, and I am convinced that the magic of both Wes Anderson\u2018s movies is the way the soundtrack perfectly compliments the aesthetics and the characters. And I was severely emotionally impacted with two very different movies pretty much because they both accompanied their dramatic peaks with Brian Eno\u2019s 3 minutes and 2 seconds of sonic perfection titled The Big Ship.\n\nListening to music is very important to me, and I have spent days and months tracking down new and interesting music since the turn of the century. I even started a (now defunct) blog to share my discoveries, with my primary motivation being the hope of getting people to send me their music. It worked very well, but before long I found myself listening to too much music that was too far removed from my musical taste, so I stopped doing it.\n\nThe past year or so, though, I\u2019ve pretty much stopped looking for new music. Not because I don\u2019t want to listen to new music, but because Spotify absolutely nailed it. From what I can tell, they have perfectly profiled my musical preferences down to my favourite guitar licks and chord-progressions. What\u2019s more, they use that knowledge to tailor make me my very own playlist, every single week. And as of late, they give me up to six fresh, never-ending playlists every single day. And to top it off, they throw me a personalised playlist with just new music they think I\u2019ll like on a weekly basis as well.\n\nSo now I spend less time looking for new music, and more time listening to music, and it feels like it is enabled by magic.\n\nInspired by this priceless assistant for musical discovery that was mine for less than 10 bucks per month, I set out to learn more about what this magic was. And, while I follow too many tech people and publications online not to have picked up on the current wave of AI and Machine Learning hysteria doing the rounds, reading about how it was applied to something so close to my heart made a difference. It took the concepts from the abstract to the concrete for me, and I thought I\u2019d share some of the articles that fascinated me the most.\n\nRecommending music on Spotify with deep learning by then Spotify intern Sander Dieleman really helped me understand some of the core concepts of deep learning, even if a lot of the technical stuff went right over my head.\n\nThe magic that makes Spotify Discovery Weekly\u2019s playlists so damn good is a nice introduction to how what goes on in the background to enable the creation of your perfectly crafted weekly playlist.\n\nThe blog of Erik Bernhardsson, the former head of Spotify\u2019s machine learning division, explores a lot of interesting concepts related to the topic.\n\nThis introduction to how machine learning has impacted something so relevant for me has really made me interested in learning more about it, how it works and how it will shape our world in the future. So in the coming months I hope to read much more about the subject. If you have any suggested reads, be sure to leave a reply. I\u2019m hoping to find sources that explain the concepts in layman\u2019s terms\u00a0:)",

There are many interesting references of the brain under the framework of complex system and Chao theory[1][2][3][4], but I don\u2019t realize there is any similar analysis on DL under the same framework. Until there are some better theories (than the current ones) of the principle of neural computation, any comparisons will likely be somewhat superficial.\n\nAs for the quantum mechanics part, I completely agree with you\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough it is always fun to flirt with the idea.
