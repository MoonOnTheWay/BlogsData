        "text": "Well written! I do agree with you that the young generation have to come up with their own ideas and implement them, on faith, for a better Nigeria, tomorrow. Since my teenage years, I had concluded that the way to change Nigeria was not through politics and power struggles but through creating opportunities that will free the young generation from the clutches of the \u201cmass mindset\u201d of \u201cYes, it is possible, but er\u2026\u201d. Congratulations to you and your co-founder on your contribution to the needed change and I hope that you continue to expand to provide more opportunities to young Nigerian minds that have decided that they will not be part of a dark story of the past but a story possibilities of the future Nigeria is capable of providing! Best wishes!",
