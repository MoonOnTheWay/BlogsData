        "text": "Thanks for the critical review, which helps to highlight a lot of current shortcomings facing the \u201cdeep learning\u201d community.\n\nTo focus on an \u201cugly\u201d property that may be more beautiful than you think\u200a\u2014\u200arobustness to \u201cfooling\u201d. The results you point to are indeed \u201cintriguing properties of neural networks\u201d (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6199v4.pdf). It\u2019s important to recognize, however, that the image alterations that \u201cfool\u201d the network were not randomly generated\u200a\u2014\u200ait was not \u201cjust a little bit of noise\u201d. Actually the alterations were based on an optimization that solved for the minimum alteration possible that would \u201cfool\u201d a network, and these alterations always exist in \u201clow probability (high dimensional) \u2018pockets\u2019 in the manifold\u201d. It\u2019s indeed all about the data set, and by identifying your \u201cknown points of highest potential confusion\u201d, you can actually better seek out clarity in your future training. For relevant additional reading on why deep neural networks tend to generally succeed very well in non-convex optimization, here is a great read: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2572v1.pdf\n\nJust to comment on Brad Pitt\u2019s frustration with black boxes: I totally agree, and there\u2019s a huge amount of opportunity for solving problems here, both for supporting general scientific research and development, but also for driving new breakthroughs in how learning is understood and implemented. At the same time, I often wonder about the concept of \u201ctrust\u201d in intelligence: why do so many of us simply trust Google Search, which is one massive black box? In any case, I\u2019d say that being able to communicate complexity in \u201cuniversal\u201d terms is indeed an extraordinarily valuable ability in developing collective intelligence, but it\u2019s an ability that many amazingly talented humans lack, too.\u00a0:)",
