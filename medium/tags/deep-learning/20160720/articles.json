        "text": "There has been a lot exciting developments on the use of Recurrent Neural Networks lately. After Andrej Karpathy\u2019s post on the Unreasonable effectiveness of RNNs and a lot of cool experiments followed. Some of which are: TEDRnn, Find Your Dream Job\u00a0, RNN Bible, DrumpfRNN. All of them make use of LSTM, a special kind of RNN that enables to connect previous information to the present task even in situations where gap between relevant information and place of prediction is large. You can find more about LSTMs in these amazing blogs written by Christopher Olah & Nikhil Buduma.\n\nI was aware that LSTM is pretty popular for generating text that sounded grammatically accurate albeit less meaningful. This made me wonder, would this be any good for transliteration? I had to scratch the itch. Having been heavily influenced by Bollywood, a monkey in my head wanted to try testing it with Desi Hip-Hop party songs. Probably because it thinks most of the lyrics are meaningless anyways. Will non-native speakers figure out if it is gibberish right away? May be not.\n\nTransliteration is conversion of a text from one script to another. For instance, the English transliteration of Hindi term \u2018\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947\u2019 is \u2018NAMASTE\u2019, while its translation is \u2018HELLO\u2019.\n\nI managed to scrape just above 100 song lyrics transliterated in English by various bollywood hip-hop artists. The data consists of only about 157000 characters (certainly not a huge data-set). In case you are not very familiar with this genre of songs, most of them although written in Hindi are swayed by Punjabi with many English terms creeping in every now and then.\n\nThe model generates lyrics by predicting one character after the other and this is where LSTM\u2019s long term context memory comes into play. This LSTM model was built using Keras with theano in the backend. I rented an Amazon\u2019s AWS GPU based g2x instance (using grid K520) and ran about 120 iterations on the data that ran approximately for about 6 hours. I did try running the algorithm on my local machine with 4 cores and compared the time taken for each epoch\u00a0. It was approximately 10 times slower than GPU.\n\nI set the seed text (required to start text generation) to something like \u201cIsh your boy Ierr\u201d, hoping that it will pickup some rapper\u2019s pattern and generate something interesting. The model started learning and for each iteration it generated a lyrics, character by character. I ignored the first few iterations since it was undecipherable. I waited and checked the outputs after 30 iterations, then 60 and then 100, only to find garbage text that sounded close to no language. I began to wonder if lstm is really not that good for transliteration or was it me doing something funny.\n\nSure enough, it was the latter case. It was realized that the seed given to the model contained only English words and that the already sparse training data mainly consisted of Hindi/Punjabi words and very few English terms. I decided to give it one more try with randomly chosen seed (of 20 characters) from the training data. As expected, the first few iterations had results like:\n\nI checked up the results after the 10th iteration, still nothing very distinctly seemed like Hindi. It was the 19th iteration when I could see a ray of hope. The text did sound very much like a Hindi/Punjabi sentence and as expected it made absolutely no sense.\n\nAs the iterations progressed it sounded like what was intended. But as it was noticed earlier, for iterations with seed terms that extensively contained English terms, the words in the lyrics generated were difficult to read. The outputs of all the iterations could be found here\u00a0.Having seen the results and considering the fact that this was run on a scanty-dataset, it would be reasonable to say that LSTM could very well be utilized for transliteration problems.\n\nThe generated set of lyrics were taken one step further. Few rhyming couplets(aabb and abab form) were randomly chosen and manually ordered. I now had a Machine generated Desi-Hip Hop song lyrics ready. To do justice to the lyrics, I collaborated with some talented people and came up with a Desi-Hip Hop music video. Don\u2019t understand the lyrics? Don\u2019t panic, Nobody does\u2026!",
