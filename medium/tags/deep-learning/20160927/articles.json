        "text": "DNN model/pattern can mimic the activity in layers of neurons in the neocortex and can recognize the patterns of sound, image and odor etc. Powerful compute cluster can now model many more layers of virtual neurons than ever before.\n\nYou can even build a new brain using such models and data but consciousness or map/layers of consciousness is something very very different; and the purpose of life is not analyzing these layers of illusions but to peel away these layers that we add to reality. If thought is merely functioning in the groove of a pattern without understanding the uselessness of pattern then such thought will inevitably lead to confusion and will make us create more hidden layers in your DNN model.\n\nTechnology will find so-called universal mega-pattern that will fit their models -because nobody is watching the watchman, and nobody knows whose black box to trust?",
