        "text": "John Battelle: I am worried that OpenAI might end up with the similiar fate as Willow Garage a couple of years back. Everything might be looking great until the funding coming in through specifically researchy markets like higher education, large research labs, and freelance programmers. I am worried that they will have lots of code but terrible documentation and that the code might not be useful to build a larger, holistic system composed on miniture pieces (e.g. deep learning modules) that work together to build \u201cstrong [and friendly] AI\u201d. Hopefully, OpenAI will organize a conference many times a year to get the researchers to convene together and make progress through Google Hangouts and other mediums of communication rather than text. Do you agree?",
