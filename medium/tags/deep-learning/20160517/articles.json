        "text": "In Queensland our government is replacing an outdated external, high stakes testing regime for senior students with an even more outdated, high stakes testing regime that is in direct contrast to a progressive and more collaborative method that our students, teachers and future society deserve. It\u2019d be easy to throw up my hands and give myself over with little resistance but I\u2019m a fighter. I\u2019ll find a way to lead my school and my students down a path that gives them the greatest chance of success in the future. Damn the man!",
