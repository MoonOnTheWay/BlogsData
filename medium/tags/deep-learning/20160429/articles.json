The colour makes them seem more vivid, more alive, even though so much of the way of life depicted is gone.\n\nI wonder if black & white isn\u2019t the single biggest factor in distancing us from the past.\n\nAs deep-learning improves the results of automatic re-colouring of black & white photography, wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if that created a new connection with history?",

Then, you start with white noise (or an input image) and perform gradient ascent on some function of the differences between the responses of the layers of the CNN on the original image and the input image/modified input image.",
