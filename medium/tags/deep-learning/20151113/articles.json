        "text": "The big news in the machine learning/deep learning world this week is Google\u2019s release of TensorFlow, their deep learning toolkit. This has prompted many to ask: why would they give away \u201ccrown jewels\u201d for such a strategic technology? The question is best answered with a machine learning joke (paraphrased): \u201cthe winners usually have the most data, not the best algorithms\u201d.\n\nNeural networks have been around for a while, but it\u2019s only been within the past 10 yrs that researchers have figured out how to train networks with many, many layers (the \u201cdeep\u201d in \u201cdeep learning\u201d). That research has been greatly accelerated by using GPUs as very high-performance, general purpose, vector processors. If a researcher can turn around an algorithm experiment in a day (vs 3 months), a lot more research gets done.\n\nBut as the joke suggests, it\u2019s all about data: you need lots and lots and LOTS of data to train a high-performance deep learning network. And Google has more data than anyone else\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s why they don\u2019t worry so much about giving away the algorithms.\n\n(Also, Google, Baidu, Twitter, Facebook, etc. are investing in GPU compute clusters that can only be described at \u201cmainframe supercomputers\u201d. Sure, you can rent GPU instances on Amazon, but there\u2019s nothing like having the latest Nvidia board with lots of RAM and very high-performance interconnect).\n\nWhat does this all mean for early stage startups? I think the situation creates lot of tough hurdles: first, freely available code and technology from Google (and Facebook) enables competitors and devalues anything the startup might develop. Second, few startups have access to a large enough proprietary data source to compete at scale. And third, GPU compute clusters need real capital.\n\nWhat\u2019s left for startups? I see at least two interesting patterns:",
