        "text": "In early 2014, Google acquired a London based startup called DeepMind. The price was over $500M. For a company that had no products, customers, or revenue, the acquisition was a contrarian move. But behind the scenes, DeepMind had been building a team of over 100 PhD AI researchers all aimed at \u201cSolving Intelligence\u201d.\n\nLed by Demis Hassabis, a child chess prodigy turned game designer turned neuroscientist, DeepMind, is working on a core intelligence platform that could serve as the platform upon which Artificial General Intelligence (think \u201cHer\u201d) could be delivered.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s efforts exist at a level of sophistication that few other firms are operating at today. Only independent firms Numenta and Vicarious (and Metamind, recently acquired by Salesforce) appear to be taking a similar \u201cManhattan Project\u201d style approach. With Google\u2019s unlimited deep pockets behind Hassabis and team, they are the odds on favorites to first create an robot consciousness. Alphabet [GOOGL] holds the #1 position in our AI Winners portfolio.\n\nHassabis was filmed at at Google Zeitgeist presentation in 2015. The talk is quite revealing.",
