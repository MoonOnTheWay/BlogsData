        "text": "Continuing our series of deep learning updates, we pulled together some of the awesome resources that have emerged since our last post on July 18th. In case you missed it, here\u2019s the July update (part 1), here\u2019s the June update, and here\u2019s the original set of 20+ resources we outlined in April. As always, this list is not comprehensive, so let us know if there\u2019s something we should add, or if you\u2019re interested in discussing this area further.\n\nOpenAI announces and opens applications for their special projects. They list several problem areas likely to be important both for advancing AI and for its long-run impact on society: detecting breakthrough, malicious AI; an AI-building AI; cybersecurity; and multi-agent simulations. You can apply to lead one of these efforts.\n\nNeural Networks for Machine Learning course by Geoffrey Hinton will be offered again in September 2016 on Coursera. Learn about artificial neural networks and how they\u2019re being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We\u2019ll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well. You can enroll now.",
