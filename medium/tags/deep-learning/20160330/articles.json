        "text": "The dialect of German spoken in Switzerland has evolved quite independently of the standard German spoke in Germany (called high-German). Since it is a dialect and not an official language, it poses a challenge for foreigners to learn. It poses a unique challenge because while there are no official rules, there are correct and incorrect usages. Such unstructured problems is exactly where new analysis approaches such as Deep Learning have a huge potential. Basically text can be scanned through one letter at time as shown on the right and each letter can be mapped to a one-hot character vector. A network can then be trained to predict the next letter based on the previous letters and learn to \u2018understand\u2019 the language and its underlying rules.\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks in particular can show an amazing, or even alarming ability to learn new and complex tasks. An excellent introduction to the topic is provided by Andrej Karpathy. Basically the recurrent aspect of the network allows for the network to maintain a memory. This means it can go through arbitrarily long sequences and use all of the information for predicting the next value. For language this opens a huge range of possibilities since it means the system is capable of learning structure from existing texts.\n\nOne of the essential aspects of Deep Learning is the ability to train for thousands to million of iterations. The feedback from each step of the training is so minuscule that only the accumulated information from thousands such learnings allows the system to learn complex structure.\n\nNot much sense or structure, spelling or anything, basically a random text generator\n\nAn idea that \u2018li\u2019 is a nice ending, a few fun let combinations and some understanding of the role of capital letters.\n\nA much clearer understanding for the language and it is starting to look more like a strange dialect. A few fun things like d\u2019 are already adopted\n\nA few more at least somewhat recognizable words and expressions, but still a long way to go.\n\nResembling even closer swiss german and for some the dialect is even clear. We see below how the following sentence is finished by various iterations of the network",

The Verge explains the difference between machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, how they work, and why the future of AI is likely to be more subtle than you think. The next wave in technology isn\u2019t about the technology, but rather the market that emerges from the technology.\n\nDeep learning is \u201ca killer technology,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s CEO says in a Fortune article that covers all things AI, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and more. While AI is still in its infancy, the road to super intelligent apps and machines is starting to come into focus.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to deeply learn more, this eBook will teach you how to use deep learning to solve problems related to image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\ntl;dr A Googler explains deep learning in just one minute\n\nDid you enjoy this?
