        "text": "This type of temp worker policy is rampant throughout the South. All warehouse and factory jobs in my area hire exclusively through various temp services. I know several people who have made the full cycle of factory jobs (brought in on one, then laid off, sent on to the next, laid off again, rinse and repeat through 10\u201315 different factories all the way back to the first) multiple times. It\u2019s an easy way for these factories to maintain a fully staffed operation without having to pay full-time salaries or offer benefits. And the constant fear of being let go keeps everyone on their toes and on edge. It\u2019s a despicable practice.",
