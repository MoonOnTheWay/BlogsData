        "text": "Google announced today the Cloud Vision API, which makes available to the general public their Deep Learning algorithms for image recognition, OCR, facial detection, etc.\n\nThere are already many Deep Learning startups offering these services, in my opinion Google could easily capture most of the market.\n\nThere are 3 reasons behind the Deep Learning renaissance, each of them a potential competitive advantage, let\u2019s see them:\n\nHow could Deep Learning startups then compete with Google?\n\nGoogle has often failed at monetizing their business services, startups may hope that it will happen again. I would not sleep well on this thought, the competitive advantage is dramatically on Google side and they will keep improving the algorithms for their internal services, regardless of API revenues.\n\nToday Google entered the Vision market, the same could soon be true also for Natural Language Processing (NLP), the other field which is seeing lots of improvements with Deep Learning. For example, most of the available services are in English, probably limited by the fact that there are much more available datasets and corpuses in this language. Google is in the best position to provide NLP services in other languages too.\n\nWhile it could be a bad day for many Deep Learning startuppers, once they get over it and refocus I think there will be a lot of very smart people working on new hard problems, making the world a better place in the process.\n\nThese are my 2 cents, what is you opinion on this topic?",
