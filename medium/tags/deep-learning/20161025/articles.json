        "text": "Machine learning, AI, Conv Nets, Deep Learning, and Neural Nets\u00a0\u2026 all rapidly maturing Artificial Intelligence technologies that have simultaneously become household jargon in the Valley.\n\nTesla\u2019s self driving car, Amazon Alexa, Google Search, Facebook tag recommendations, Microsoft Cortana, and Apple Siri\u00a0\u2026 all novel products leveraging the above mentioned AI technologies, developed by large tech mainstays, and increasingly popular nation wide.\n\nTechnocrati cocktail banter is developed and largely kept in-house by large technology incumbents to develop new products and disrupt adjacent industries. We\u2019re witnessing first hand the world bifurcating, the haves and the have-nots. That said, historically a rapid rise and maturation of a new technology germinates within the the confines of a select few labs, institutions, social classes, and corporations before hitting a critical juncture when, via technological or economic means, it rapidly democratizes and is made available to everyone.\n\nClarifai\u2019s growing product suite around developer centric AI tools are leading exactly that charge: democratizing the Artificial Intelligence revolution. 18 months ago when we first invested alongside Union Square Ventures in the company\u2019s Series A, Clarifai had built a best in class image classification API catapulted by founder and CEO Matt Zeiler\u2019s PhD work at NYU. There he had single handedly taken home the ImageNet championship\u200a\u2014\u200athe Super Bowl of image recognition. At the time we openly admitted we weren\u2019t sure what future products would look like, didn\u2019t know which industries, platforms, and verticals to explore, and had an open and long mind when it came to future business model and the economics behind the business.\n\nFlash forward to today and it\u2019s become increasingly clear just how impactful the AI revolution is and will continue to be. Written without hyperbole: no single industry or vertical will remain untouched, and those that don\u2019t adopt will almost inevitably fall prey to technological disruption. This highlights the importance for those outside the Valley elite to have access to the rapidly evolving AI stack. Today Clarifai not only hosts a static API that tags thousands of images and videos with human level accuracy, but now empowers anyone from a wedding photographer to a large retail company to a sail boat enthusiast (hat tip: USV\u2019s Albert Wenger) to easily access and build products employing Google level AI with drag and drop ease of use.\n\nIt\u2019s still early innings, and there\u2019s lots of work to do\u200a\u2014\u200abut today we\u2019re proud to announce Clarifai\u2019s $30M Series B led by Menlo Ventures, with an outsized doubling down from Lux. We\u2019re more than ever excited about the fundamental role AI will play across all industries and proud to back Matt and the team at Clarifai to continue enabling the democratization of AI for the masses. If you\u2019re interested to be part of the journey the team is actively growing and hiring. If you\u2019re outside the walls of the technology elite, but have product ideas that leverage cutting edge AI and deep learning\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Clarifai to empower you to realize your vision.",
