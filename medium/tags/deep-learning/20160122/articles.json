Thusly, I forth-tweeted:\n\nThen, and OMG, get this, as I was going to bed, I was reading my \u201cbloggies\u201d and came across some lovely news. Udacity had just partnered with Google to launch their own DL class. And no, that doesn\u2019t stand for down-low you crazy kids. It stands for Learning on a WHOLE NEW PLANE.\n\nI guess when you tell the universe what you want, it conspires to give it to you:\n\nAnd so, because of this noreaster winter wonderland that we\u2019re about to have in NYC this weekend, maybe you spend some time with a bottle of red, red wine and some scientist dudes to learn how all software will be developed in the future (MVC, eat your heart out).",
