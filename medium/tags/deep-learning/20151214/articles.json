        "text": "Bots have gotten a bad rap for trolling on Twitter and other social media. Despite their current reputation, the market is on the verge of being overwhelmed by friendly, highly useful bots. In fact, soon there will be so many useful bots that the number of stand alone mobile apps we use will drop dramatically over the next 2\u20133 years.\n\nWe are on the cusp of shifting to a new user interface\u200a\u2014\u200aCUI\u200a\u2014\u200aConversational User Interface, where business and play will be conducted and transacted via messaging, with automated software\u200a\u2014\u200abots. Bots will transform marketing, customer service and e-commerce. Bots will accelerate productivity within enterprises.\n\nWhere will these bots be, who will create them, and which players stand to benefit? Bots will be embedded in stand alone mobile apps and enterprise software, but most bots will reside within platforms\u200a\u2014\u200amessaging platforms.\n\nThere will be challenges. Scale is an issue, today some bots use a combination of hard coding and live people to deliver. Some are introducing machine learning/artificial intelligence. Some are taking that even further into the most complex AI\u200a\u2014\u200adeep learning and neural networks. Bot discovery is another challenge. Context and ease of use is another.\n\nI will publish new research on Bots soon, via a short form research note (5\u20138 pages), or via Analyst Inquiry.
