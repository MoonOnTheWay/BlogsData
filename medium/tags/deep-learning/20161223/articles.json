        "text": "There are 3 essential ingredients that are needed to understand intelligence and unfortunately present day mathematics has trouble tackling. Mathematics are tools that enhance our reasoning processes. Mathematics is a human language that we employ to derive understanding of reality. However, this language are not all powerful and does have limitations. We explore some of these limitations here with respect to areas important to AI.\n\nAlthough mathematics tends to get developed way ahead of its time, there are many times that the application of a different kind of mathematics to a new domain leads to breakthroughs. Richard Feynman, for example, employed century-old path integrals mathematics to gain new insight on developing Quantum Electrodynamics. There are however plenty of limitations in mathematics and this article addresses those limitations with respect to our ability to comprehend essential ingredients of cognition.\n\nThe \u201cQuasi-empiricism\u201d of math is not a new idea. Mathematics is a human language that we employ to describe our reality. Quoted from the Wikipedia article [WIKI-1]:\n\nThe first ingredient is the notion of time.\n\nTime is a difficult concept to grasp. I guess the easiest way to handle it is just do what Einstein did. Just treat it as another dimension.\n\nMost physics is invariant in time. Meaning, you can move forward or backward in time and the physics are identical. However, at the macro-world we don\u2019t see it that way, time exists because entropy exists. The arrow of time follows that of increasing entropy.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s really no notion of memory without having to consider the existence of time.\n\nMost mathematics don\u2019t have a concept of memory. Memory is the equivalent of having state and almost all mathematics involves functional constructs that are stateless. Functional programming follows a single assignment rule where once any variable is set, it remains set to that state, never changing. It is this constraint that makes the use of functional programming something that is easily parallelizable. It is a convenient constraint that allows our mathematics to be analyzable.\n\nWe cannot, however, avoid time, because that\u2019s where the dynamics come from. The only context that mathematics is helpful in dynamics is in the context where there is no memory exits. Introduce memory or introduce state, then all bets are off! The best that mathematics can do is to quantify the boundaries of computation and not predict its final behavior (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) [WIKI-2].\n\nThe only dynamics that is analyzable by math are equilibrium states. We can only make statements about states that are in equilibrium. What happens in between, that is computation, can only be, at best, be simulated. Equilibrium is the state when we assume that time is at infinity. An unrealistic assumption, but an assumption that is brought about by convenience.\n\nThere is also the notion of asynchrony that is such a beast in complexity. That is, when different parallel processes are not in lockstep synchrony. All our digital circuitry require lockstep synchrony in the form of a common clock that drives behavior. The biological brain does not have a common clock, it works in a regime of asynchrony.\n\nThe second ingredient is the notion of collective emergent behavior.\n\nRobert Robert Sapolsky has a short lecture on Youtube [SAP] (\u201cThinking about emergence and chaos\u201d) that brings about the point about bottom-up behavior (Special thanks to Felix Hovsepian for pointing put this video). He says that \u201cmost of the stuff that he and his peers do is reductive stuff that is very limited.\u201d\n\nIntelligence comes from the emergent behavior that arises from the collective behavior of millions or billions of interacting components. This is the very essence of the concept of Connectionist AI. The components themselves do not have to be constructed in a complex manner and can be very simple and in fact be all uniform. Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning spring from this very idea of deriving intelligence from simple components called \u2018neurons\u2019. It is important to remind oneself that the neurons in ANN are a cartoonish version of a biological neuron. However, it is not the precise construction of the neuron that is important, but rather it is the collective behavior that is important.\n\nThat is why the reasoning that ANN and DL should be rejected because they are not biologically plausible is a very bad argument. It is entirely conceivable that intelligence can be arrived with very different kinds of \u2018neurons\u2019. That\u2019s because, there\u2019s some fundamental capability that a neuron performs (i.e. information dynamics, meaning computation, memory, and signaling) that is all that is needed, however, the connectivity is where intelligence emerges.\n\nThe third ingredient is the notion of meta-level reasoning.\n\nThis is the most difficult to grasp idea and it may, in fact, be the reason why \u2018consciousness\u2019 exists. We can understand the idea of building up ideas by the composition of more primitive ideas. We can understand this because that is how language is constructed. That is, from letters to syllables to words to sentences to paragraphs etc.\n\nWe also know of meta-level reasoning. It\u2019s one of those ideas that\u2019s hard to explain to novice programmers, but it exists in many programming languages. That is, you have programs that operate on the building blocks of the language itself. It leads to very expressive and short source code. Experienced programmers have no difficulty working at the meta-level. However, these kinds of system are extremely difficult to debug.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t stop with just one level of meta-reasoning. You could have meta-meta level constructs ad infinitum. I\u2019ve encountered this idea in the wild in the modeling language UML. There\u2019s a concept of meta-metamodels, here\u2019s the definition:\n\nWhich, it just occurs to me, is the most universal definition of \u201cGeneralization\u201d.\n\nThis lecture by James Crutchfield on \u201cThe Complexity of Simplicity\u201d gives a very good sense of the enormous gap that we have between our math its ability to analyze complex systems:\n\nI\u2019ve received the wrong impression with this article that I\u2019m implying that mathematics is not needed. On the contrary, it is absolutely necessary. However, I am also banging the table for those who can\u2019t see that present day mathematics has its limitations. There are many who continue to stick to 18th-century Bayesian logic and corresponding mathematics and have an unsubstantiated belief that it is actually even going to work in this new domain.\n\nThere are plenty of times where I see researchers attempt to cast DL systems in terms of \u2018equivalent\u2019 Bayesian networks in the hope that placing a round peg into a square hole will actually work. Well, it\u2019ll work if the round peg\u2019s diameter is smaller than the whole width of the square. But it is obvious that it wouldn\u2019t be a great fit. There is absolutely no evidence that the reductionist logic is going to work in a domain of collective emergent behavior. If you approached a room of statistical physicists about using Bayesian inference, then you likely will be thrown out of the room in ridicule. Let\u2019s all get real folks!",
