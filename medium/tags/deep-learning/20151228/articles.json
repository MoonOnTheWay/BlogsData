Open Finder and Drag DeepLearningForiOS.xcodeproj over to the demo app in xcode\n\n6. Highlighted line below shows how the framework DeepLearningForiOS.xcodeproj can be included\n\n7. Click on app settings (highlighted line in left part of Xcode) and go the General tab on the right\n\n8.

        "text": "Happy to announce that a (early) version of DeepLearningKit is available on:\n\n0. What does DeepLearningKit do?\n\nIt currently allows using deep convolutional neural networks model trained in Caffe on Apple\u2019s iOS, OS X and tvOS (transformed from protobuffers into json with the tool athttps://github.com/DeepLearningKit/caffemodel2json\u200a\u2014\u200aa tutorial about this will come later).\n\n2. How to get started?\n\nHave a look at Tutorial\u200a\u2014\u200aUsing DeepLearningKit with iOS for iPhone and iPad\u200a\u2014\u200ait is about using a pre-trained CIFAR-10 Network in Network example.\n\n3. What is DeepLearningKit developed in?\n\nIt is developed in Metal (for GPU Acceleration) and Swift (for app integration). I believe DeepLearningKit is the first (public) Deep Learning tool that is using the Metal compute API for GPUs (Metal is Apple\u2019s recommended way to program GPUs)\n\nMore tutorials and a paper describing DeepLearningKit will be made available on http://deeplearningkit.org (+ http://arxiv.org for the paper)\n\n5. I love developing for Apple\u2019s [iOS,OS X or tvOS] and would like to contribute to this project, how?\n\nHere are a few thoughts:\n\n6. Is DeepLearningKit production ready for my mission critical app?\n\nmost likely not, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from testing it out?\n\n7. DeepLearningKit reminds me more about CUDA/GPU Libraries such as Nvidia\u2019s cuDNN or Facebook\u2019s fbCunn rather than larger tools such as Torch, TensorFlow and Caffe, is that right?\n\nYou\u2019re right, DeepLearningKit can be roughly seen as an early \u201cmetalDNN\u201d with Swift packaging for loading and running models. (It currently doesn\u2019t support Fast Fourier based convolution such as Facebook\u2019s fbcunn)\n\nDeepLearningKit was developed and opensourced by the company Memkite\u200a\u2014\u200acheck out the About page for details",
