You can now instantly share and publish data through Kaggle.\n\nUber\u2019s First Self-Driving Fleet Arrives in Pittsburgh This Month\u200a\u2014\u200aBloomberg\n\nThe autonomous cars, launching this summer, are custom Volvo XC90s, supervised by humans in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nWith the growing amount of online data, there is a need for more flexible tools to better understand the content of the very large datasets required to provide more accurate classification results. Facebook tries address this by open sourcing a library designed to help build scalable solutions for text representation and classification.\n\nOpenAI announces it\u2019s first Machine Learning Unconference, an experimental gathering driven by its participants rather than an organizing committee.",
