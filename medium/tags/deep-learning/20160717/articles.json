        "text": "Web app of the day: Algorithmia\u2019s auto-colorization service allows you to colorise black and white photos. The results are interesting with varying levels of success (see an example above).\n\nAlgorithmia is a hosting service for deep learning models allowing for developers to use it\u2019s cloud infrastructure for deployment of their algorithms, as well as use other people\u2019s models in their own application (so you could built a mobile app that use the auto-colorisation API for example).\n\n\u00a0In case you (like me) hadn\u2019t heard the \u201calgorithmic intelligence\u201d term before:\n\nIf you have any black and white photo, try out the demo and get more information here.",
