        "text": "Artificial intelligence has long been an exciting area and I have already dedicated more than 15 years doing research, and building all sorts of machine intelligence systems and products on search, advertising, recommendation etc.\n\nThis time I would like to try something new. An area where human activity dominates and AI has the potential to make a dent.\n\nIt all starts with a book by Ed Thorp, a great mathematician and pioneer on quantitative investing. In 1967 Ed and Sheen published a book: Beat the Market: A Scientific Stock Market System, in that book they built a system which could consistently beat the market with a statistical edge. Since then Ed left academic and launched a very successful career as a hedge fund manager. His track record is no less splendid than the one held by the Omaha oracle. Ed\u2019s work demonstrates that well crafted machine system could beat the market 50 years ago.\n\nIn the last 10 years, big data has been the driven force for the great success of Google, Facebook, Amazon. New AI technologies like deep learning enable companies to create more human like robots and intelligent machines.\n\nCould the new AI beat the market again?\n\nS&P 500 Index beats the majority of mutual fund managers. If we could create a robot who could consistently beat S&P 500, would we claim victory?\n\nOr if a robot could do a better job on rating or recommending stocks than analysts, would we consider this task done?\n\nEither way it would be a good demonstration of the usefulness of AI in investing, a domain where Wall Street analysts have dominated for so long.\n\nEd has done it many years ago, and so are the few. It would be a fun journey, and this time with new AI.",
