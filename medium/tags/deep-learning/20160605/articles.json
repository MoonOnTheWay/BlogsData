        "text": "These are probably enough (combined with some tutorials) if you just want to be able to play with and tweak existing ML/DL code and algorithms.\n\nMachine Learning by Andrew Ng @ Coursera\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\n\nFantastic introductory course and foundation for ML. Covers basics of ML from linear and logistic regression to artificial neural networks. Gives great insight into concepts and techniques with minimal maths. Requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and differential calculus. Note: doesn\u2019t cover specifities of current deep learning (e.g. convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks etc.), so is mainly a great foundation for more advanced studies. Andrew Ng was co-founder of Google Brain and now chief scientist at Baidu research. He is great at giving intuition.\n\nDeep Learning by Google @ Udacity\n\nhttps://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730\n\nBrief introduction to DL for those who are familiar with ML. This is a very short course, I think I went through the whole thing in under 2 hours. It\u2019s almost a reading of the tensorflow tutorials (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/index.html ). It gives a top level summary of basic DL techniques. Assumes you\u2019re comfortable with ML and related concepts. So at least Andrew Ng\u2019s coursera (or equivalent knowledge) is a must. Don\u2019t expect to be a DL wizard after this, but at least you might know what a CNN or RNN is. If you\u2019re going to look at any of the advanced ML courses below, watch this DL course after them.\n\nThese will help you understand what\u2019s actually going on, perhaps even understand some DL papers (I say \u2018some\u2019 DL papers because others are just insanely theoretical and dense).\n\nCS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence by Pieter Abbeel @ Berkeley\n\n(some videos have audio issues, so below are a bunch of playlists from different years, I had to pick and choose from different playlists depending on audio problems).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZUttQj8ytfASQIcvsLYgg (Spring 2015)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB4_W1V-KfwpTLxH9jG1_iA (Spring 2014)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshmLD2MsyqAKBx8ctivb5Q (Fall 2013)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CS188Spring2013 (Spring 2013)\n\nThis is a fantastic introduction to AI in general, not specifically ML and introduces many different fundamental areas of AI and ML. Spreads the net very wide, so if all you\u2019re interested in is playing convolutional neural networks to make things like Deepdream, then 90% of this course won\u2019t be relevant. The first half is more agent-based AI starting with CSPs, decision trees, MDPs etc, and in that respect it is a bit unique compared to the other courses on this list. Then goes into various different classic ML topics. It is an introduction, so requires no prior knowledge of AI or ML, but it does go into maths, so requires decent understanding of the usual probability, linear algebra, calculus etc. Doesn\u2019t cover DL but a great foundation for a lot of AI and ML, especially if you want to get more into agent-based AI such as RL and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n\nCS540 Machine Learning by Nando de Freitas @ UBC 2013\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EdyJ5lbFl8UuGjecvVw66F6\n\nThis covers many classic ML and SI etc from start all the way to neural networks. Doesn\u2019t require prior knowledge of ML, so can be considered comprehensive introduction. It\u2019s way more thorough and detailed than Andrew Ng\u2019s Coursera and goes heavy into maths. Bear in mind it\u2019s a post-graduate CS course so it\u2019s quite advanced. Again spreads the net quite wide, but not as wide as CS188, instead goes deeper into some areas. Only brief intro to DL but comprehensive foundation in ML and SI. Nando is ace. Also prof at Oxford and works for Deepmind.\n\nCS340 Machine Learning by Nando de Freitas @ UBC 2012\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--Ecf_5nCbnSQMHqORpiChfJf\n\nSimilar to above, but undergraduate version. I haven\u2019t actually watched these so I don\u2019t know how they differ from CS540. Probably bit simpler.\n\nDeep Learning by Nando de Freitas @ Oxford 2015\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu\n\nSimilar to CS540 but more about DL. Definitely requires more understanding of statistics and multivariate differential calculus, and prior knowledge in ML/SI (Andrew Ng\u2019s coursera may be enough, but I really recommend Nando\u2019s CS540 or Pieter\u2019s CS188). Even knowledge of information theory would be useful. Great guest lectures by Alex Graves on generative RNNs and Karol Gregor on VAEs.\n\nCS229 Machine Learning by Andrew Ng @ Stanford 2008\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599\n\nAnother very comprehensive introduction to ML/SI. Nothing like his Coursera, way more theoretical and covers lots more topics, and much more thorough. Kind of like a mashup of Pieter Abbeel\u2019s CS188 AI Course and Nando de Freitas\u2019s CS540 ML Course. This course is more detailed in some areas, and less detailed in others (e.g. AFAIR goes deeper into MDPs and RL than Abbeel\u2019s CS188, but doesn\u2019t cover bayes nets). They all provide slightly different perspectives and insights. Also doesn\u2019t cover DL, just a really solid comprehensive foundation for ML and SI.\n\nNeural Networks for Machine Learning by Geoffrey Hinton @ Coursera\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets\n\nGoes deep into some areas of DL and rather advanced. Hinton is one of the titans of DL and there is a lot of insight in here, but I found it a bit all over the place and I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it. I.e. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very useful as a linear educationalresource and requies prior knowledge of ML, SI and DL. If you first learn these topics elsewhere (e.g. videos above) and then come back to this course then you can find great insight. Otherwise if you dive straight into this you will get lost.\n\nComputational Neuroscience by Rajesh Rao & Adrienne Fairhall @ Coursera\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/compneuro\n\nNot directly related to DL but fascinating nevertheless. Starts quite fun but gets rather heavy, especially Adrienne\u2019s sections. Rajesh takes things quite slow and re-iterates everything, but I think Adrienne is used to dealing with comp-neuroscience postgrad students and flies through the slides. Expect to pause the video on every slide while you try to digest what\u2019s on the screen. Requires decent understanding of the usual suspects, linear algebra, differential calculus, probability and statistical analysis, including things like PCA etc.",
