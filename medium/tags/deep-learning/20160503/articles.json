        "text": "From the birds-eye viewpoint of a Planet Labs\u2019 satellite, Verch\u00e8res can seem tranquil. Over a 5-day span, little seems to change\u2014same river, same fields, same streets.\n\nThe village of Verch\u00e8res lies on the St. Lawrence River in the Canadian Province of Qu\u00e9bec. Away from the river it is surrounded by fields that grow everything from feed for animals (cattle, pigs, and chickens) to wine grapes and cider apples. About 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the center of Montr\u00e9al, it\u2019s isolated from the daily hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nBut if you look closer\u2014both in time and in space\u2014you realize there is change, and it is constant. Look at the fields in the pictures below. From April 21 to April 23 the fields got a shade darker\u2014possibly the result of the quarter inch of rain that fell on April 22.\n\nOn the 24th and following days, a handful of fields change from light to dark, evidence of farmers tilling their land in preparation for spring planting. (The long, thin fields are a relic of French colonialism. The French king granted land to local lords, who in turn allowed tenants to work the land on parcels that began along the riverbanks. It\u2019s one of many examples of how human history shapes agricultural landscapes.)\n\nZoom in again, and details emerge on a more human scale. Shipping containers and vehicles are re-arranged in an industrial park. You can even spot changes in the water circulating in the open ponds of a sewage treatment plant\u2014perhaps caused by shifting winds.\n\nPlanet Labs\u2019 operational constellation will view the Earth at about 50 times the spatial resolution of MODIS (NASA\u2019s twin Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments). This dataset will fill in the gaps between very high resolution satellites with targeted observations, and low-resolution systems designed to observe weather and climate.\n\nA global, daily picture of the Earth is a radical new dataset that\u2019s ripe for analysis. It\u2019s a time machine that lets you examine any spot on the planet, whether it be a big city center, the Amazon Rainforest, or a small village like Verch\u00e8res.\n\nSee how organizations all over the world can use timely satellite data.",
