        "text": "If you starting with Deep learning and want a free and easy learning resource for practicing Deep learning concepts\u200a\u2014\u200astart using the Watson API\u200a\u2014\u200aI think its free for now. You need to know REST API calls using curl commands.\n\nLets start training a Classifier Algorithm with [set of Images and Class label for each Image] and create a new Image recognizing\u200a\u2014\u200aClassifier model.\n\nYou only need Images- jpg or png files and label each Image.\n\nOur Objective\u200a\u2014\u200aOnce the Image classifier Model is created, the new Model should identify the Image file you submit as Input and return the Correct Label for the Image file.\n\nOnce the Classifier Model is created and tested by You, please deploy the Model for production use and your Apps can use this Model using REST API.\n\nPlease watch these Videos for starting with Deep learning\u200a\u2014\u200avery simple",
