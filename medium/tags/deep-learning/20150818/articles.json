        "text": "We started out to delve into the concept of cloud Baby, and now that idea is being solidified and taking the shape of Baby Robot. We often say that knowledge and embodied knowledge cannot be separated without realizing the gravity of such statement: look at real human babies, for example\u200a\u2014\u200athey use the entire body to experience the world surrounds them and to express their feelings. We now know that there is a clear connection between the two types of knowledge, and pursuing this combination, or bridge, rather, is the key for us in developing Baby Robot. Perhaps, this course of development was inevitable, predetermined since the day we came up with the term Baby as our core concept.\n\nOur next SDK will be something that represents this idea of Baby Robot.",
