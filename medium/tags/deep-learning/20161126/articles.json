        "text": "You trust Siri. Siri does improve your life as she gets to know you. But no, you are no free spirit. Being a mammal means you have built-in programming for social cohesion or else you would not survive (and would have been weeded out long ago, dodo!) but the tradeoff is having certain highly exploitable cognitive backdoors (\u201chacks\u201d) to your decision-making processes and belief systems.\n\nPersonal assistant A may have a business alliance with Ford but not Chevy, Pizza Hut and not Dominos, A AND NOT B. This addresses two of the three viewpoints.\n\nThe third is society\u2019s viewpoint which is the collective outcome of all these decisions which is, once again, the definition of TIS which, in the 0D case, is:\n\n[Technology + Message \u2192 Neurobiology \u2192 Society A \u2192 Society B] where: (Technology = media vehicle (0D personal assistant)+ finely-tuned language (i.e. dialogue content between you and the assistant)).\n\nGoogle Assistant \u2192 Samantha is a long way off.\n\nGoogle Assistant \u2192 TIS is not far off if organized correctly.\n\nTechnological hurdles are enormous to build Samantha 1.0, but how about TIS 1.0 = Samantha 0.1?\n\nThere is only one major technological hurdle besides TIS-specific stuff to building the world\u2019s first TIS, TIS beta; what is required to build a TIS beta is the systems engineering process of integrating the components into a deep learning model given a game with different rules than chess, Go, Pong, bond trading, etc. Rules from the propaganda playbook (and other sources) are good to go. The biggest technical hurdle is an ongoing one; a better natural language interface so that communication between personal assistant and the user becomes frictionless like you and I having a chat without the current frustration:\n\nRight now, the best of the lot, Google Assistant(or Google Home), has progressed from crappy to bad+ and is well on its way to ok- but not yet.\n\nApple iPhone 7 became wireless not to sell more headsets and piss you off but because the future is the Her interface; AirPods \u2194 Siri is the interface and the smartphone is the mothership you eventually forget about collecting dust in your purse which will open up a big opportunity for iWatch to go from useless to essential for both access to immediate (relevant) visual information and as a multi-functional physiological sensor device.\n\nBy cross-pollinating the fields of neuroscience (specifically: neuroplasticity of learning and sleep research) with chron0biology and linking that into your chronotype (lark, owl), you can better synchronize communication with neurological susceptibility to messages. Don\u2019t laugh. Just a small % change in sales conversion rate equates to billions at scale. In other words, Tim Cook could decide to give away the iWatch to reward (only) heavy Siri users just to get physiological data for Siri\u2019s cloud to chew on; then refine the language and better target the timing of the semantic payloads via those elegant AirPods. But isn\u2019t that evil? Not necessarily. Like all powerful technologies it is neither intrinsically good or bad.\n\nTIS is morals-blind: it can be Hitler on steroids or the anti-Hitler on steroids. But rest assured: both are coming, they are inevitable, a bipolar singularity will engulf us\u200a\u2014\u200alike it or not.\n\nSo, as for Apple, if done with the right intensions it is a win-win. Tim Cook should do it. Steve Jobs would have, me thinks. I like the chances of technology being developed by the major companies to be in the greater good of society simply on the merits of sustainability; it is the smaller ones lurking in the shadows on the margins that bear the most concern as predators. Apple has always been true to a wholesome moral compass and there is no reason to expect otherwise going forward.\n\nIn any case, at the end of the day, TIS beta is just another complex game like learning how to control a driverless car which is a very hard problem. With TIS, you need a giant simulation where it is fed lots of live data from real people in an unsupervised format starting from scratch and it learns how to get people to choose A instead of B better than 50/50 (one application for TIS = A AND NOT B), passing the Turing Test is irrelevant. You must crawl before you walk and walk before you run: start crawling now. The TIS lab prototype figures it out by making lots of errors (those little cars crashed a lot in some rubber-bumpered parking lot for awhile before it could parallel park!) and then correcting them until it moves the needle to 55/45 which = mammoth pay-dirt.\n\n60/40. 70/30\u202690/10? 98/2? This happened with Pong, Go, autonomous cars, lip reading, and recognizing a mostly hidden cat in crappy lighting conditions better than a human can. Now it is about influencing a human\u2019s decision making process. This will happen for one trillion reasons straight away right off the top of my head: follow the money.\n\nQuestion: Instead of displaying goofy ads that are maybe relevant why not create what is relevant directly and communicate it through simple conversation that even a twelve-year would get excited about?\n\n{computer science dominant (old) \u2192 TIS:(synergy of computer + many biological sciences)}\n\n{predict what somebody wants with search autocomplete (obsolete) \u2192 TIS:(determine wants)}\n\nNote: Much harder than accelerated learning but they overlap. Doing a TIS beta for learning will scaffold (\u201cbaby step\u201d) for A AND NOT B: [What would you like to: learn \u2192 believe \u2192 believe emphatically]. Embodied cognition = \u201cthe brain is an organ for adaptation to the the unknown.\u201d What if my program/algorithm is a brain cheatsheet where answers to \u201cthe unknown\u201d are given obliquely[2a] and then reinforced directly at (what I will call) a high \u201csemantic-perception signal:noise ratio\u201d with other evidence or soft data?",

        "text": "It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like technology but they seem to be afraid when it comes to new revolutionary technologies.\n\nIf you look back in the history at the discovery of electricity for example, people were afraid of this technology. They knew that electricity could kill humans by its power and a lot criticized it, some of them swear to god that they\u2019ll never use it, and it includes never using machines.\n\nBut step by step, it became the standards for many of us. At this time people who were against the use of electricity saw their challengers who were using it, growing faster than them and taking the major part of the market place.\n\nThe same thing happened when Nicolas Tesla discovered the alternating current and at the discovery of the personal computer and the discovery of Internet and many other things\u2026\n\nPeople were against all those things, but a small part of them knew that it was important and uses it by any means of the danger.\n\nIt knows so much opposition that we could imagine that opposition is the beginning of great things.\n\nNowadays, the same thing is happening with artificial intelligence, trans humanism and machine learning like deep learning.\n\nA lot of people are against those technologies, think that they\u2019ll never use it. Some of them are afraid, because they think that those technologies could destroy humanity as we know it and that those technologies will be uncontrollable by humans and they\u2019ll end by controlling us (just like in the matrix movie or what ever).\n\nThe truth is that like the electricity, this fair is legitimate. But as electricity don\u2019t kill every user and with time began to be almost completely safe, as artificial intelligence and the others are made to be safe, and people are already working on making it safer preventing the damages that it could make.",

        "text": "Recently I got very interested in deep learning and the most important reason, I was intrigued by the idea of programming a machine so that it can do things which humans can do just because we have few concepts or abstractions built into or acquired by us. These are the ones which helps us decode the world as we see, hear or feel.\n\nAll of this started when out of interest I started Google ML Recipes and Sirajology on YouTube(I will definitely recommend both if someone wants to get started or have a quick hands-on in machine learning). Finding pattern in data and learning from well defined features using classic machine learning algorithm with an underlying statistical model was very interesting but when I learnt about deep learning\u2019s approach to solve a classification problem and how it can use smaller representation at various layers or transfer its learning to do something which it hasn\u2019t ever seen or even programed to handle and how the models are inspired from human neural net, my curiosity sky rocketed.\n\nWhat I intend to do with this series of posts is publish small writeups about things I come across while exploring this unknown world of deep learning. I will share and give due credits to all the sources.",
