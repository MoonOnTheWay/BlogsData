        "text": "The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, held recently in New York, saw a doubling of both submissions and attendees on the previous year. This kind of exponential growth is appropriate given the incredible progress the field itself has made of the last few years. Entrepreneur First sent along two of our team to ICML as part of our efforts to continue supporting founders who are pushing the boundaries of technology.\n\nMagic Pony Technology, one of the startups formed at EF in 2014, has over 20 patents in using machine learning for image enhancement and video compression, and their recent acquisition by Twitter is a clear indicator of how highly-valued this kind of technology is.\n\nThe ICML invited talk by Fei Fei Li, director of the Stanford AI Lab and Stanford Vision Lab, demonstrated really well the pace of progress that has been achieved. In 2011, state-of-the-art computer vision systems could achieve around 74% accuracy in the ImageNet classification task (classifying 1.5 million images into 1000 categories, such as \u2018cat\u2019 or \u2018plane\u2019), and results had been improving only by 1 or 2 percent year on year. By 2014, the accuracy had skyrocketed to 93%. Today, the best systems can match, or even out-perform, humans on this task.\n\nSo\u200a\u2014\u200awhat changed between 2011 and 2014? The answer is the rise of Deep Learning\u200a\u2014\u200athe extension of classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, by employing more complex model structure and training them on much larger datasets. This has been enabled by the wider availability of these large datasets and the development of GPU-based algorithms to train the models themselves. Convolutional Neural Networks, for example, use a complex structure inspired by visual cortex in animals and are, aptly, most generally applied to computer vision tasks.\n\nBy combining Convolutional Networks with other techniques (such as Recurrent Neural Networks), Fei Fei Li was able to demonstrate in her talk a potential application of Deep Learning for a new kind of task: dense captioning. Dense captioning goes far beyond simple recognition of objects\u200a\u2014\u200athe network learns to generate novel, complex, descriptions (e.g. \u2018white laptop on table\u2019) for up to 300 objects in any provided image, as well as locating where those objects by surrounding them in a box. The technology is far from perfect at this stage, but, even so, the progress so far is impressive.\n\nAdvances in Deep Learning, such as the Dense Captioning technique mentioned above, open up a range of high impact products. The challenge is in commercialisation though, and this is an area where we can really provide support at EF. We saw this with Tractable, another EF-incubated startup. With the support of our Venture Partners and Science Partners, we helped Razvan Ranca, who had an academic background in using Machine Learning for document recovery, find a co-founder, Alex Dalyac, and build a startup founded on his expertise. Tractable now uses image recognition and text analytics to provide automation of expert tasks for enterprise businesses.\n\nApplications for our 2017 programmes in London and Singapore are open now and close in September, so apply now and maximize the impact of your research.",

        "text": "Did you ever have a \u201cmusic friend\u201d?\n\nThe friend who always had their headphones on at school. The friend that would often share their music with you, and would tell you what was cool.\n\nI was one of those friends. In our group, I was one of the go-to persons for the latest music and playlists.\n\nWhenever my mother had people over for dinner, she would ask me to sort out a playlist for the evening. Often halfway through the meal, she would tell me to change the vibe and by the time we were having dessert, I would find myself moving the music in another direction once again.\n\nWhenever one of my friends threw a house party, I would be asked to bring over my music collection and vet music our other friends would bring to the party, to ensure we had some kind of consistency throughout the night.",
