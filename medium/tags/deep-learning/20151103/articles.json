They want machine to understand pictures like human do it.\n\nThey have different purpose of their research\u200a\u2014\u200agoogle is using this technology to power their Photos app, Facebook is improving accessibility of their platform.\n\nBoth tech can be in handy for visually impaired people.\n\nHere is the latest example from facebook\n\nBoth companies are using neuron networks. And whats interesting there, that with evolving of technology, blind people will be able to get real time audio description of surroundings using onhead cam for example. Of course pushing all the info on whats near you through audio doesnt make sense, though using assistant and asking question can do the work.\n\nImaging this concept but using camera on your head instead of steady image from your facebook feed.\n\n[fbvideo link=\u201dhttps://www.facebook.com/Engineering/videos/10153621574817200/\" width=\u201d500\" height=\u201d400\" onlyvideo=\u201d1\"]\n\nUsing Dash cam and image analyze your smartphone will be able to predict the obstacles while you move, where there is a puddle or pole ahead and you need to turn to avoid it.\n\nYou can read more on what is Facebook doing on image recognition here:\u00a0\n\nhttps://code.facebook.com/posts/1478523512478471/teaching-machines-to-see-and-understand-advances-in-ai-research/\n\nhttp://www.fastcompany.com/3052194/elasticity/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-help-bring-photos-to-life-for-the-blind#3",

Don\u2019t lie to yourself, every time you see someone that has it worse then you, you go home with the biggest smile one your face go on you phone take selfies and your happy for about 5 minutes then you see a snapchat of people having more fun then you and your back to depressing quotes sub tweets. Just stop be normal be your self and stop letting others control your life.",
