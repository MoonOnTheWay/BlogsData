        "text": "Most major tech companies are use Deep Learning techniques in one way or another, and many have new initiatives on the way. Self-driving cars use Deep Learning to model their environment. Siri, Cortana and Google Now use it for speech recognition, Facebook for facial recognition, and Skype for real-time translation.\n\nNaturally there are a lot of startups doing cool things in the space. I tried to do my best to categorize the companies below based on where their main focus seems to be. If you\u2019re a Deep Learning company and I forgot you, please do let me know!\n\nBecause Deep Learning is such a generic approach, some companies are focusing on creating infrastructure, algorithms, and tools that can be applied across a variety of domains.\n\nDeepMind, which was acquired by Google for more than $500M in 2014, is working on general-purpose AI algorithms using a combination of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. DeepMind is the company behind an algorithm that learns to play Atari games better than humans. It is a largely a research company and does not provide products for use by businesses or consumers.\n\nMetaMind focuses on providing cutting-edge performance for image and natural language classification tasks. Richard Socher, the founder of Metamind, is very active in the academic community and teaches Stanford\u2019s Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing class. The company offers a cloud service to train Deep Learning classifiers.\n\nNervana is the company behind the open source Python-based neon framework, a GPU-optimized library to build Deep Learning architectures. Nervana also provides a cloud services where it runs algorithms on proprietary hardware specifically designed for Deep Learning. Nervana raised $20.5M in a June 2015 round led by Data Collective.\n\nSkymind is the company behind the Deeplearning4j framework. Deeplearning4j makes efficient use of GPUs and integrates with distributed systems such as Hadoop and Spark to scale to large data sets. Skymind sells an enterprise editions of its software together with training and support.\n\nErsatz Labs offers a cloud service to manage data and train Deep Learning models through a web interface (video) or an API. Pricing is based on minutes of GPU time used.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Deep Learning gained most of its popularity through excellent performance on a variety of computer visions tasks: Recognizing objects in images, understanding scenes, and finding semantically similar images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a popular type of Deep Learning architecture, are now considered the standard for most of the above. The rapid success of Deep Learning in Computer Vision has spurred a lot of startup activity.\n\nMadbits was acquired by Twitter in 2014 before it got a chance to launch publicly. In its own words, it \u201cbuilt visual intelligence technology that automatically understands, organizes and extracts relevant information from raw media (images)\u201d.\n\nPerceptio was acquired by Apple In October 2015 while still in stealth mode. The website was shut down after the acquisition, but Perceptio seems to have been developing technology to run image-classifications algorithms on smartphones.\n\nLookflow was acquired by Yahoo/Flickr in October 2013. It\u2019s unclear what exactly Lookflow was offering, but it was using Deep Learning algorithms for image classifications to help organize photos.\n\nHyperVerge builds technology for a range of visual recognition tasks, including facial recognition, scene recognition, and image similarity search. HyperVerge is also working on a smart photo organization app called Silver. The company came out of IIT and raised a $1M seed round from NEA in August 2015.\n\nDeepomatic builds object recognition technology to identify products (e.g. shoes) in images, which can then be monetized through e-commerce links. It focuses on the fashion vertical and has raised $1.4M from Alven Capital (a French VC) and Angels in September 2015.\n\nDescartes Labs focuses on understanding large datasets of images, such as satellite images. An example use case is tracking agriculture development across the country. Descartes Labs came out of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and has raised $3.3M of funding to date.\n\nClarifai uses CNNs to provide an API for image and video tagging. In April 2015, Clarifai raised a $10M Series A led by USV.\n\nTractable trains image classifiers to automate inspection tasks currently done by humans, for example detecting cracks on industrial pipes or inspecting cars.\n\nAffectiva classifies emotional reactions based on facial images. It raised $12 million in Series C funding Horizon Ventures and Mary Meeker and Kleiner Perkins in 2012.\n\nAlpaca is the company behind Labellio, a cloud service to build your own deep learning image classifier using a graphical interface.\n\nAfter the rapid success in Computer Vision, researchers were quick in adopting Deep Learning techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In fact, the exact same algorithm that categorizes images can be used to analyze text. Since then, new Deep Learning techniques specifically for NLP have been developed, and are being applied to tasks such as categorizing text, finding content themes, analyzing sentiment, recognizing entities, or answering free-form questions.\n\nAlchemyAPI was acquired by IBM (Watson group) in March 2015. It provides a range of Natural Language Processing APIs, including Sentiment Analysis, Entity Extraction and Concept Tagging. (AlchemyAPI also provides computer vision APIs, but their primary product seems to be language-related so I decided to put them in this category).\n\nVocalIQ was working on a conversational voice-dialog system before being acquired by Apple in October 2015.\n\nIdibon develops general-purpose NLP algorithms that can be applied to any language. Idibon\u2019s public API does Sentiment Analysis for English, but more languages, and support for Named Entity Recognition are coming soon. Idibon raised a $5.5M Series A led by Altpoin, Khosla, and Morningside Ventures in October 2014.\n\nSemantria provides APIs and Excel plugins to perform various NLP tasks in 10+ languages. Pricing starts at $1,000/month for both Excel plugins and API access. Lexalytics, an on-premise NLP platform, acquired Semantria in 2014.\n\nParallelDots provides APIs for Semantic Proximity, Entity Extraction, Taxonomy Classification and Sentiment Analysis, as well as tools for social media analytics and automated timeline construction.\n\nInstead of focusing on general-purpose vision or language applications, some companies are applying Deep Learning techniques to specific verticals. My research surfaced mostly Healthcare companies, but It\u2019s likely that many others are using Deep Learning without explicitly mentioning in on their website.\n\nEnlitic applies deep learning techniques to medical diagnostics. By classifying x-rays, MRIs and CT scans, Enlitic can recognize early signs of cancer more accurately than humans. The company raised $3M from undisclosed investors in February 2015.\n\nQuantified Skin uses selfies to track and analyze a person\u2019s skin and recommends beneficial products and activities. The company raised a total of $280k in 3 rounds.\n\nDeep Genomics uses Deep Learning to classify and interpret genetic variants. Its first product is SPIDEX, a dataset of genetic variants and their predicted effects.\n\nAre there any Deep Learning startups I missed? I\u2019d love to hear about them in the comments.",

        "text": "Last week we purchased the new iPhone 6S and had high expectations of its GPU performance. One of the reasons for our expectations was a blog post by Simon Gladman where he wrote that iPhone 6S had 3 times the GPU performance of iPhone 6, this was also reported by TheNextWeb.\n\nIn our GPU programming case (developing Deep Learning algorithms with Metal)\u200a\u2014\u200agoing from iPhone 5S to iPhone 6S\u200a\u2014\u200agot 1 order of magnitude in improved performance! Calculation time to run through a 20 layer deep convolutional neural network model for image recognition went from approximately 2 seconds to less than 100 milliseconds. Note that 100 milliseconds or in other words 0.1 seconds is what Jacob Nielsen stated is one of 3 important response times\u200a\u2014\u200athat a user feels a system reacts instantenously.\n\nThis blog post gives a brief overview of Memkite (where we are and where we are going)\u200a\u2014\u200aa Deep Learning Kit for iOS, OS X and tvOS. It is developed in Metal in order to make efficient use of the GPU and Swift for setting up Metal as well as loading data and integrate with apps.\n\n1. Memkite\u200a\u2014\u200aGPU Accelerated Deep Learning for Apple\u2019s iOS, tvOS and OS X with Metal and Swift\n\nMemkite currently implements Convolutional Neural Networks in Metal (parallelized for the GPU), deep learning layer operators include: convolution, pooling, relu layer.\n\nOn OS X Memkite can easily be adapted to utilize several GPUs if present, e.g. to run the same deep learning model on several GPUs to increase throughput or run different models in order to increase number of classes to predict over. An interesting feature on iOS (and most likely on tvOS, but not yet tested in our case) is that one can share memory between GPU and CPU (less copying of data).\n\nGiven the immense asymmetry in time taken to train a Deep Learning Model versus time needed to use it (e.g. to do image recognition), it makes perfect sense to build a large repository of pre-trained models that can be (re)used several times. Since there are several popular tools used to train Deep Learning models (e.g. Caffe, Torch, Theano, DeepLearning4J, PyLearn and Nervana) we\u2019re working on supporting importing pre-trained models in those tools into an \u201capp store\u201d for deep learning models (currently we\u2019ve been primarily been working with Caffe CNN models).\n\nThe tweet above illustrates how much energy is required to train a Deep Network (per night), some Deep Learning Models can take weeks of training on GPUs like the Nvidia TitanX, or in other words piles of wood of energy. Using a model is quite different since it requires less energy than lighting match.\n\nDeep Learning Models also typically have a (low) limit in the number of classes they can predict per model (e.g. in the ImageNet competition there are 1000 classes, CIFAR-100 100 classes and CIFAR-10 10 classes). This means that in order to create real-life applications one need to intelligently (and very rapid load them from SSD into GPU accessible RAM) switch between several Deep Learning Models, or if there is enough capacity one can run several models in parallel on the same GPU. Selecting an approriate Deep Learning model (i.e. which is the most likely to work well in a given context) is to our knowledge not a well-studied field of research, and in some ways it resembles the meta or universal search problem found in web search (e.g. cross-model ranking), but latency plays an even bigger part in the mobile on-device case (don\u2019t have time to run many models).\n\nWith state-of-the-art compression techniques for Convolutional Neural Network the (groundbreaking) AlexNet model from 2012 can be compressed from 240MB to 6.9MB. This means that one could theoretically fit more than eighteen thousand AlexNet models on a 128 GB mobile device like the iPhone 6!\n\nDeep Learning on iOS, tvOS and OS X devices is still in its infancy, and we hope to play a part in it, and we look forward to test Memkite Deep Learning on the forthcoming iPad Pro (it has a very powerful GPU!).",
