        "text": "Lately, Machine Learning has become one of the hottest topics for all companies\u200a\u2014\u200ain any area\u200a\u2014\u200a. Due to the exponential growth of data, there is a huge economic and strategic interest to be able to extract every ounce of information from it; with the promise of understanding user needs, predicting actions, and proposing the most accurate content. Faster. Deeper.\n\nSince 2000, neural networks have evolved into something more advanced known as Deep Learning. It is a specific field of Machine Learning, inspired by biological intelligence. It represents data using different layers of interconnected blocks. Each layer is responsible for a new level of abstraction or new concept.\n\nBig companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft use Deep Learning to extract information from all types of data (pictures, videos, text, website,\u00a0\u2026). Recently they all released their frameworks publicly. With the goal to make great progress in this field. See CNTK, FAIR and TensorFlow.\n\nWant to learn more about Machine Learning?",
