        "title": "Silence is Your True Expression \u2013",
        "text": "Right from my childhood days and now being an entrepreneur who is doing good if not great, I have been loving the silence, no I wasn\u2019t in depression, it has been just my way of being expressive without expecting any reaction and response. That helped me to be an excellent observer and helped me assessing the reality of life to come out of any kinds of complex situation.\n\nHow? Well, it just taught me to understand others feelings and their side of the story. I have always been so calm, so composed so balanced to handle the given situation. Yes being a silent listener, a keen observer and a man of few words, I have learned the life\u2019s knitty gritties and have had amazing experiences so far.\n\nWhat I learned in the journey so far, being a silent listener and yes, now being a vociferous speaker as a startup evangelist ? I will try to give some pointers which I would like to dedicate to all those introverts who have a lot to say, but prefer to remain silent and do more, to express themselves.\n\nTwo Very Important Lessons From My book of life which I learned going silent:\n\nHave you realized that very often when you feel lost you go absolutely quiet, I don\u2019t find this state of being to be negative, but to be a state of being one with oneself and with the surroundings. It is the state of realization that no matter how challenging and ugly life looks from the outset the reality is different and life is beautiful, it is just our perception which needs to be changed. This quite state of being, sets a platform which teaches and prepare us to become what we ever wanted to.\n\nWhen you master this art of going silent and being calm in the moment of distress, anxiety, you slowly start to become responsible and responsive to handle the given situations. This subtle art helps you to take some great decisions, especially when you are in the leadership position. It empowers you to analyze the situation with the required wisdom, it fills you with a positive energy to reverse you testing situations.\n\nMind it you have only one life, don\u2019t think that you can simply live irresponsibly and do away being a burden on this mother earth . You need to practice this art of introspecting your life situations very often by going silent, learning to close your eyes and addressing those feelings of being lost. When you do this you will gradually become a wise human being who knows how to respect this gifted life."

        "title": "BlockChain Principle, Type & Application & Why You Should Care About It",
        "text": "BlockChain Principle, Type & Application & Why You Should Care About It\n\nBlockchain technology has become a new darling of this 21st century. But much before this technology came into existence there was a system of Digital Cash which was conceptualized by Chaum in 1983 to handle the concept of double spending, even though advanced cryptography existed at the time too, but it failed to be compatible with centralization, the anonymity of the transaction and double spending.\n\nSo three decades later in 2009 Satoshi came up with Bitcoin, a world\u2019s first decentralized currency, which replaced the digital cash centralized server signature mechanism, with a consensus based proof of work. It solved the issue of double spending and improvised the concept of Chaum\u2019s by introducing the decentralized payment system using revolutionary Blockchain technology.\n\nI would like to discuss the 5 underlying principle behind this tech of the future and how it can be utilized by techies to change the world in a bigger way.\n\nBlockchain is a P2P network where no single participant(user) controls the transaction, the power is distributed among all the participants in this network, that means no single stakeholder can hack,manipulate or close the chain of blocks or can shut it down. This blockchain network due to its distributed(Decentralized) mechanism is free from any hacks or fraud.\n\nIn the blockchain powered network all the participants have got the rights to make decisions, here the trust in the system is not forced but is totally guided by user intuition. The tight integrity is observed in the way every user gets incentivized for their effort and also in the way this entire P2P network function.\n\nBlockchain has been designed with this core principle to provide high levelof security and authenticity to the user. To ensure tightly knit security & data integrity it uses the power of cryptography. The Blockchain transaction mechanism is favorable & rewarding for an authentic user at the same time it is very harsh on reckless user. That means the blockchain system is fair for all who behave as a good user and reward them appropriately. But if you go about using it with wrong intent you are not spared and penalized.\n\nBlockchain being distributed network, there is no one central point of failure and also no single person can behave recklessly to damage the entire chain of network. The damage because of any individual hack of password will limit to that single person itself. With blockchain PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) encryption mechanism your transaction over the network is highly secured until you are a fool to share your private key for which no technology has a solution. So, largely you can trust on Blockahin technology to ensure your transactions gets completed without being hacked .\n\nThe Blockchain is inclusive in its approach where everyone is independent to participate without any discrimination in the global economy. The bitcoin allows all the richest, the poorest, to invest in their capacity and become part of this global economy, as the need to have a bank account was totally removed . They can directly decide to transact to whomsoever they want without third party intervention that too paying zero to very little transaction fee.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s main contribution to the world will be the inclusion of one and all to be a part of this global economy, which will be fair, safe, secure and just to all.\n\nIn a digital world, where consumers and businesses transact online for shopping, transferring payments & to verify information for a myriad of purposes, ensuring data privacy has become paramount. It\u2019s Strong Hash Key encryption is quite secure and helps you exchange data over the internet without disclosing your true identity.\n\nWith Blockchain your identity is never revealed while you transact using the blokchain P2P network.Your Rights and freedom is clear and enforceable, as you become part of the blockchain ecosystem. The Blockchain\u2019s Smart Contract is an awesome way to execute any agreement between two parties, which basically allow for transactions to go through only when certain predefined benchmarks have been reached and agreed upon both parties involved..\n\nNow that you have understood the underlying principle behind Blockchain let us understand the simplified explanation of blockchain as define by\n\nYou (a \u201cnode\u201d) have a file of transactions on your computer (a \u201cledger\u201d). Two government accountants (let\u2019s call them \u201cminers\u201d) have the same file on theirs (so it\u2019s \u201cdistributed\u201d). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.\n\nEach accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary \u201cBitcoins\u201d). The first to check and validate hits \u201cREPLY ALL\u201d, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction (\u201cProof of Work\u201d). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file\u2026\n\nThis concept is enabled by \u201cBlockchain\u201d technology."

        "title": "How You Can Become Truly Liberated? \u2013",
        "text": "How You Can Become Truly Liberated?\n\nI am no more Me I have transformed myself to We, to see this world with the eyes of my team members, my family and every known and unknown person around me. In-fact trees and nature has become me and helping me live the life which is more inclusive and more loving.\n\nWe all are privileged Millennials to get all kinds of freedom to speak, to act, to learn, to earn and much more, but all these have not come easily to us. We have lot many people dead and alive behind it, who made it possible for us with their unparalleled sacrifices. So it becomes crucial that we are not using our freedom carelessly. We have even greater responsibility to act in a manner which set us free truly to create an impact on this world.\n\nIn my long career of 15 Years I have experienced that:\n\nSo when it comes to corporate the real freedom doesn\u2019t mean you are free to do anything without being productive in your endeavor. You need to measure your work output with the amount of freedom you are availing. You are free to choose your approach and the way of working, but not to burn your time irresponsibly. I have seen, especially in startups where the workforce is less, freedom concept is very often misunderstood and misused.\n\nNo, freedom has always been a great instrument of success & change, for the people who have the vision to become what they want and have intelligently aligned it well with their company\u2019s vision .\n\nFor them company\u2019s success is not different from their own individual growth, they have ensured that they utilize their time in doing more things in their life than to waste it on something which doesn\u2019t fit well with their life\u2019s goals/purpose. Freedom can lead to negative results in any given organization only and only when you act irresponsibly and have individual agendas to enforce.\n\nSelfish motive has been killing the corporate culture and has been hampering the growth largely, which is quite prominent at all the level of leadership. So one should understand it clearly that:\n\nThe company is as good as the people working there.\n\nEvery individual has the role to play in shaping the culture and vision of the organization. Until every individual is committed on their part and understands the value of sharing and caring for others, the organization can\u2019t function to its true potential. Having said that, it is also equally important that every individual understands and adopt the shared vision of their organization, to direct their work effort and help it attain to its business goals.\n\nUntil you give your 100% don\u2019t expect 100% to return back .\n\nAnything done with a vested interest is bound to create conflict and mass dissatisfaction within any organization. So if you need to build a progressive culture make sure your perception to see each others effort changes and you appreciates each others endeavor in a positive manner. One needs to think beyond themselves to become inclusive in their work effort. Yes,it is too idealistic to think, but it has to be practiced and inculcated by individuals irrespective of their position in an organization, if they want to reap the benefit of their hard work they are putting, in building a scalable company.\n\nPeople sitting at top leadership position are the ones who will decide how any organization will work or grow. So it becomes crucial that they learn and practice the art of handling people selflessly. They need to develop a sense of \u201cWe Together\u201d than forcing their individual agenda Of \u201cI Know It All\u201d.\n\nYou alone can\u2019t bring any significant change in an organization, it has to be you and your inspired team who will do wonderful things together to help you grow as a true leader.\n\nOnce you give a certain freedom to someone in your team, you must fully trust them and be supportive. If you can give them a sense of being there for them, you will see that they will go out of their comfort zone to perform beyond expectations.\n\nInspirational leadership, foster inclusiveness, where leaders take the responsibility for any failure and never indulge in individual blame game. They are smart people who know how to develop bonds with their team members, giving them the required space to help them perform at their peak. They value the effort of their team members and appreciate their contribution to make them feel worthy.\n\nThe most difficult art of life is to trust, which once mastered by anyone will liberate them fully.\n\nThanks for being a true inspiration and accepting my style of writing, which has been buggy. I am improving day by day just because of your love. So keep loving, keep sharing"

        "title": "Ask These 3 Fundamental Questions Before You Do A Startup?",
        "text": "Ask These 3 Fundamental Questions Before You Do A Startup?\n\nHey, It\u2019s great to know that you are having a brilliant concept which you would like to develop and carve out a niche business out of it. But hold on have you asked this 2 question to yourself? If not I would require your kind attention please. Because these questions if not asked can lead to an outcome which may be fatal for your business and can become an obstacle going forward.\n\nSo what are those crucial questions which any aspiring entrepreneurs should ask to himself before he plans to jump into this uncertain world of Startup\n\nYes, it\u2019s extremely important to asses your financial bandwidth before you even think to jump into starting up and so this question becomes critical for you to ask and until you have an answer for this it is recommended not to burn yourself out. Yes, it may sound so fascinating at the start that you have a billion dollar idea which needs to be developed, but until you have a fuel to sustain the initial f****ng phase, you may blow yourself to the level from where it may become difficult to carry forward.\n\nIf you personally don\u2019t have the financial bandwidth you need to team up or buy someone\u2019s interest in your concept. Having money power is the brutal reality. That\u2019s why you can see the successful billion dollar startup trend, most of the founding team had a decent financial background to start with. Yes, there are exceptions, but that number is too low to cite. Most of the success stories have come from the founders(I am citing an example from Indian Startups Who Made It Big) with strong educational & financial background who left their lucrative career with sufficient financial backup & domain knowledge to kick-start their startup venture.\n\nUntil you have a strong financial plan in place to smoothly cross that testing and tiring phase you better think twice before starting up, yes, you may get lucky, but the chances of crossing that first 2 years of your startup journey would become extremely challenging without proper financial backup in place\n\nI have seen many wannapreneurs who without any required skill-sets, dreams to change the world while they themselves struggled in their professional life . I am not saying that you can\u2019t do it, but the point i am trying to make is that you necessarily need to have a prior knowledge to deliver what you want from your project, or a potential co-founder needs to complement your skill to materialize the startup idea. It happens many times that the founder has the strong communication skill, but not the required technical skill to execute the entire project plan. In that case he needs to first put a visionary tech cofounder in place who can deliver the technology part.\n\nDon\u2019t team up with day dreamers who just spend most of their time planning and doing no ground work in learning and executing the art. You will end up burning time, resources and energy in the wrong direction.\n\nIt is paramount that what you are developing has UBP: unique bragging proposition to help your product get the traction with the help of the user\u2019s who will be your product\u2019s brand ambassador.\n\nFirst, you define the target audience for your product, make a small MVP, do both online and offline market survey to understand what your target audience has to say about your product idea. Do they really need it or not? Will they speak about your product to other people ? You need to define the survey queries which fits to your product need and then analyze the sample data collected using various sampling tools. If not all, you will have some data to help you understand about your product being a market fit or not.\n\nHaving said that you should be also be smart enough to assees the current and upcoming market trends and see how your idea fits into this to cater the user problems\n\nThis article in no way trying to disappoint or discourage you, it is just an observation from my life experiences which I am sharing based on my own success and failures. I may be wrong and I wish that everyone of you who wants to build your dream startup succeed, but reality can be different and I invite you all to have your first hand experience and decide for yourself instead of listening to my advice."

        "title": "Why Introspection Is Crucial For All? \u2013",
        "text": "Why Introspection Is Crucial For All?\n\nHow often you sit back, relax and reflect on your life? Well, you may argue where is the time to do so, but I feel it to be nothing more than an excuse to fool yourself. If you can\u2019t spare few valuable min for self-reflection you are either too busy accumulating or don\u2019t have the guts to face the real you. Whatever you are doing to make your life happen, you need to understand that you need to revisit and reflect upon your life very often and question your life approach at every stage.\n\nIt is extremely important that we take a moment out of our regular life to clarify our values in a moment of chaos or uncertainty.\n\nSelf-reflection & introspection is a mechanism to scrutinize your internal feelings by going inward, which helps you to rebuild your lost relation with your own self. It helps you to seek a solution to your problems which largely is your own making.\n\nSelf-assessment is an exercise which gives you the real picture of how you are conducting your life, it is a question mark on your life itself, until you ask some hard questions you may seldom find the right approach, to grow in your life.\n\nThe original idea of introspection was developed by Wilhelm Wundt in the late 1800s (McLeod, 2008). Wundt focused on three areas of mental functioning: thoughts, images, and feelings. Wundt\u2019s work eventually led to the current work on perceptual processes and the establishment of the field of cognitive psychology.\n\nAs per the research (done by wood in 2013) it is found that we have more than 50,000 thought floating in our monkey mind on every given day. Out of this more than 90% thought is repetitive & are attributed to be consuming our mind-space with crappy stuffs. 50 % of our thought content comes out to be negative in nature, Which has no real base as such, but are consuming our mind energies in wrong direction thereby hampering our ability to think with clarity & conviction.\n\nSo if you truly want to grow with time you need to get rid of this unwanted thoughts which you have borrowed externally. It is only possible if you take some time out for self-reflection and question your day to day living methodology.\n\nSo if you want to increase your productivity level and enhance your life perceptions you need to focus on your life energies which is right within you. When you get into a spiritually inspired, explorative mode of life, you give yourself a chance to push a refresh button and purify your thought process. To weed out negative thoughts, you need to sit quietly with yourself, talk to yourself in a moment of solace, self -engage yourself in an activity which is purely directed to your own-self.\n\nHaving said that it is also recommended that you don\u2019t get obsessed with self-reflection and start to over stretch this self-inquiry as you need to do some real world implementation to test out the impact of it. It is crucial that you do this inquiry with a right approach & methodology. Have a congenial environment around you when you sit with yourself or go into a meditative state.\n\nSo it becomes very important that you balance your introspective state and do not over do it to a level where you go into a self-denial mode and start punishing yourself for no reasons. As humans, we are on this earth to explore and engage in the real world more often, fail and learn from our endeavor and grow out of all challenges which is is not in your control fully.\n\nThe best way to introspect is to ask questions which have more to do with What? Than Why?\n\nThese are the 10 important questions which one should ask while he is self-introspecting oneself:\n\nIn this article I have tried to coin some researches and life observations from my practical book of life to bring forth the key importance of self-assessment. It is just a first part of this piece , we will get into more detail in our next in the series of self-introspection where we will cover what are the tools to achieve this state of mind and how we can benefit from it,with some practical examples to make our case stronger.\n\nDo whatever you want to do with your life, but make sure you are not becoming a burden for yourself and for your loved ones around. If something is not right internally you need to speak up, go inward and share the feelings by asking for help, so that you don\u2019t end up messing your valuable life for nothing. You have the capabilities to deliver excellence you just need right perception to see this life as a beautiful medium to express your hidden potential. Explore it , question it and do wonderful things, never settle and challenge your status quo to create new opportunities for you and for the people around you. Be happy for what you have and try to utilize it to your full potential to innovate and create something meaningful and wonderful.\n\nThanks for being a true inspiration and for appreciating my endeavor to write more.

        "text": "What I Learned From My Real Life Hero- My Father ?\n\nFor the first time I am taking this bold liberty to bring forward the real life story of my life which may not resonate well with few, but I felt like sharing this to bring forth the sacrifices our parents make to give us a life we are blessed with. They stand strong with us, to inspire us & protect us, taking all the pain to keep us safe and happy. This is for all seekers who value life and treat it well in all circumstances and also for those who wants to learn this art of living.\n\nHe always used to tell me:\n\nAnd used to elaborate on this statement with a very compelling real life story of his own. Now it has been 33 Years(for me) and I can still remember those magical words of his. Whenever I feel low I revisit his thoughts, he used to share and boost myself up to face what this amazing life has to offer.\n\nTo salute his optimism & approach towards life, Today I thought to share his life journey which can be a kind of inspiration for every common man and I hope it will reverberate with many of you who are currently reading my piece of real life story .\n\nI can clearly remember my big brother narrating how my father has struggled all his life with limited resources he had at his disposal. So I will try to pen down what I heard & personally experienced while growing up .\n\nHe lost his mother when he was hardly 6 months old, he grew up being treated as alien in his own family after my grandfather married to bring a new mother for him. But he seldom got the love he deserved as a growing kid. He managed to study till higher secondary even though he was a studious child, but among two other brothers and 4 sisters, he hardly got the support he needed to pursue his study. He was treated as if he has committed any mistake by loosing his mother at such a tender age.\n\nHe was married immediately after he completed his 12th education, with this responsibility of his better half he has to take one crucial decision, after being denied the higher education and with the added burden of feeding the family, he took one brave decision which turned out to be the best decision he took in his lifetime. He left the home at age of 18 with a heavy heart, he left my mom at her native place and went to Meerut.\n\nAnd learned to drive a bus under one of his early day angel cum friend who offered him the shelter when he came to know that my father was spending his nights sleeping on the railway station. After mastering the art of driving he got one opportunity to become a conductor of the public bus. He worked and toiled hard to earn the require bread & butter for his living.\n\nHe managed to save few bucks to be sent to my mom who was expecting a daughter(My elder sister, We are 4 brothers and sisters & I am the youngest one) Life seems to be testing him like hell, my mom was not keeping well, my superman was left all alone with no financial & moral support from his own father and to add to his troubles, he met a small accident which hit him hard as he was jobless for many months. But this Super Hero was not willing to surrender.\n\nWhile he was on the bed, he decided to further educate himself. After he recovered, he enrolled for the graduation program (From Art Stream ) which he managed somehow while he was earning his livelihood. My sisters and brothers were all growing up and this was putting a lot of burden on his shoulder, being the only bread earner.\n\nSo was the case with him where he got a lucky break to apply for the Job in NTPC(National Thermal Power Corporation) and the eligibility was to be a graduate with past hands on driving experience. He got selected and became an employee of this Navratna Company, which kind of changed the life of a very simple man who can hardly believe his luck. Then there was no turning back, well a lot happened in his journey where he has to cut short his wish list to ensure his kids gets the proper education, which was kind of denied to him when he was growing up and when he needed a lot. This fostered the required grit in him to create a congenial platform for his family where we all got the required opportunity to learn the mandatory life skills to navigate this life smoothly. We were lucky to get all the required education.\n\n4 of us (siblings) grew up with a very limited luxury, but with a lot of love and care which inspired all of us and glued us strong as a family. We sometimes felt our classmates had more to boast upon, but we always made the required adjustment & tweaked our lifestyle with a deep respect for this superman who, along with our iron lady(our mom) worked hard to ensure basic & mandatory needs are always met for their growing kids.\n\nNow he is a retired man(he retired being a senior engineer with no real degree, but with the required training & a zeal to learn ), but still not looking to settle down to enjoy the perks he has earned for himself in this 58 years. He now runs his own small grocery business which is just a platform for him to keep himself engaged with the life. He still rises up early morning, does the needful morning activities and leaves for the shop at 8 a.m. to serve the customers who eagerly waits for him to supply the required milk and bread. They inspire him to wake up early and exercise his duties which kind of fulfills him at the end of the day.\n\nRecently I had a call with him when I was feeling a bit low, he shared his word of wisdom & said:\n\nHe is a real super hero of my life, his life is in itself a lesson from which I always take my daily dose of inspiration to empower my entrepreneurial journey. I am blessed to be the youngest & sharing my journey with him and my mother, along with my siblings . My Mom & Dad has been my real life heroes and I truly admire them for passing me all the required skills to live this life to the fullest."

        "text": "Listen To Your Intuition It Somehow Knows What's Right !\n\nWe always try to fool ourselves by the false promises & wrong assumptions which is far flung from the reality. Our intuition always signals what is right and what is wrong? But we knowingly ignore all the facts, blaming it all to the circumstances. When we start living by letting our situations make mockery of ourself and letting it control our actions we put ourself into very precarious state. This state of living will always lead to a chaotic situation which can kind of blew you up uncontrollably.\n\nA world expects from you a lot and will always do so, but you don\u2019t need to give a damn to their expectations, you first need to address what you expect from yourself, and if you can take care of your inner feelings you will be in a frame of mind to gratify everyone around. If you are not feeling right doing something and you are just waiting for the right moment to get out of it, let me clarify you that there is no such right or wrong moment. Every moment is the right moment, you just need to see, how much you are prepared to convert those moments to work your way.\n\nI have personally experienced that when I am anxious my level of productivity increases, it very often triggers a right kind of emotions within me to fire me up. Yes, in this moment of anxiety people often gets into a zone where they feel crippled and become clueless, their brain takes over them to safeguard them, which is quite natural and normal way our brain is attuned to function. But we should also learn the art to come out of this zone very quickly to see the things with utter clarity. It will not happen overnight you need to train yourself and engineer yourself from within.\n\nSadhguru ji has a right word for it called as Inner Engineering"

Tina & Ronu were very practical in their approach, they knew that if they have to pull this string of life smoothly they need to strengthen the bond in such a manner that it do not break under any circumstances.\n\nThey removed this one word from their life \u201cExpectation\u201d and replaced this with another word \u201cAcceptance\u201d. They both accepted each other as they are. Tina instead of being a working woman managed to keep her daughter and husband engaged with her in whatever little time she had. She never missed to pamper Ronu with a message of love and always reached home before him to cook a meal sparkled with lots of love & care. Even though she came tired, but her love was pure and free from the expectation which kind of reflected in her small small gesture to show how much she cared.\n\nRonu always offered his helping hand in cooking and pampering the daughter. If sometimes Tina got late to come back home from the office, Ronu ensured she got the comfort when she is back. He prepared a coffee and offered her some snacks, He used to ask this one little question, how was your day today? They shared their stuffs together, cracked some jokes to keep the environment light and soothing.\n\nIn a nutshell, they never indulged in a discussion which will kill the little time they have to spend, and they spent all this available moment to show their love & care for each other with no strings attached.\n\nYes, I know you all must be finding this story so idealistic to believe, but the point here is not to make you believe something, the whole essence of this story here is to make all of us realize what wrong we do very often while managing relationship, which has resulted into so much tension and frustration. The point I am trying to bring forth is this\n\nSo if you really care for your loved one\u2019s do this one thing without failing. Never take this burden of expectations. Give yourself and your better half the space they need, the way you appreciate each others beauty & strength also accept each others weaknesses. It is very important to learn this art of accepting each other completely without any if\u2019s & buts.\n\nIf something doesn\u2019t happen between you and your partner the way you wanted it to happen, simply let go the bad feeling, put yourself in the shoes of the other person, to understand their side of the story and you will be surprised to know how much love and care is lying deep within.\n\nIt all comes down to the perception you have about each other, the moment you start judging and make conclusions you end up messing your life. If you sit with each other and are willing enough to speak your heart out you will understand that you made up all negative stuffs in your mind, all were the false imagination which had no concrete base at all.\n\nSo what if you expected your husband to be super rich and successful and the reality turned out to be different why not you accept him for what he is. He is a human with heart why not love him for his endeavor he is putting to earn a living for you & the family. Why not you accept your wife who is making your life beautiful by showering all his love & care she has to offer as a homemaker, and if she has a goal to be an independent married woman why not you give a wing to her dream, instead of discouraging her by saying, will you be able to manage all the stuff. If you both partner in each others dreams and are willing enough to support each other, it is quite easy to have a life full of fun and bliss.\n\nBeing a husband and a father of a lovely daughter (which I am so proud of) I also face difficulties in managing my business and personal life. But one thing which has helped me going great is the understanding that she too has a life which she wants to live her way. She is unique in her way of taking care of the family and never expect her to be like someone or somebody. I find her amazing every time I see her and silently appreciate the contribution she is making to make my life wonderful.\n\nThanks for being so understanding and appreciating my effort every time I write and share. Thanks All\u2026\u2026"

        "text": "How TeraHertz Technology Will Change The World Of Wireless Communication ?\n\nAs per the latest news reported by GadgetsNow:\n\nThe group of researchers have come up with a new THz microchip (terahertz) which boasts of running your optical communication devices like computers etc, at 100 times faster than what current wireless communication technology currently can deliver. It\u2019s a new innovation in data transfer tech.\n\nOne of the core scientist Levy Says :\n\nOn the same note, Today I would like to enlighten all my lovely readers with this new Imaging technology called Terahertz(THz Gap) which is easily a new innovation in the world of science and can be a game changer in the coming future.\n\nTerahertz or THz can be understood as :\n\nTerahertz (THz) frequency range (0.1 THz \u2014 3 THz) is the last span within the whole electromagnetic wave spectrum, and is revered in the scientific world as THz Gap.\n\nThis terahertz gap is a taking tech world\u2019s imagination to all new level fostering many new possibilities in optical communication technology.\n\nTerahertz waves lie at the far end of the infrared band, just before the start of the microwave band.\n\nThe most innovative contribution of this THz wave is in the field of Imaging technology. Let\u2019s understand how this tech is revolutionizing many industrial sector with its unique abilities of being -\n\nTablet coating plays a crucial role in regulating the release of active ingredients in the body. Coating not only contributes to the bioavailability of a particular drug or combination of drugs during certain times and locations, but also coating can protect the stomach from high concentrations of active ingredients, improve tablet visual appeal and extend shelf life by protecting the ingredients from degradation by moisture and oxygen.\n\nTHz imaging can be quite useful in performing 3D analysis on tablets. It can enable to determine the coating integrity and thickness, detect and identify localized chemical or physical structure such as cracks or chemical agglomeration within a core and to interrogate embedded layers for delamination and integrity.\n\nTHz can penetrate into clothes and plastics without damaging it, so it can be quite useful in detecting any objects of concern specially at airport for object screening to uncover concealed weapons . Passive detection of terahertz signatures avoids the bodily privacy concerns of other detection by being targeted to a very specific range of materials and objects.\n\nIt can be used for people screening and luggage scanning. Here the emphasis is primarily made on one feature that unlike X-ray, THz radiation is not detrimental to human body. THz scanners allow remote detection of metallic, plastic, ceramic and other object concealed under clothes \u2014 at a distance of a few meters.\n\nNon-destructive analysis (NDT) of the internal structure of objects (quality control of products). THz cameras tech is quite effective in finding defects in sealed packages food products under various enclosures.\n\nTHz is quite suitable to develop a current generation wireless telecommunication system which can fire at a blazing fast speed of 100 Gb/sec. This utility of Terahertz tech is quite promising for high-speed information transmission between electronic devices; building wireless local area networks (WLAN) and wireless personal area networks (WPAN) of new generation.\n\nThe team of Levy as we discussed in the starting is successfully leveraging this terahertz innovation to develop a new kind of microchip which will make your gadgets super smart and super speedy.\n\nNow, by using a Metal-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (MONOS) structure, Levy and his research team have come up with a new kind of circuit that uses flash memory technology \u2014 the kind used in flash drives and discs-on-key \u2014 in microchips. If they succed in their reserach this technology will enable standard 8\u201316 gigahertz computers to run 100 times faster and will bring all optic devices closer to the holy grail of communications \u2014 the terahertz chip.\n\nThanks for being a wonderful reader and inspiring me to write more.."

        "text": "What I Learned From My Hitchhiker Friend\n\nI have been struggling to find what is that one single most powerful mantra to be successful in anything one wants to do, this struggle continued for last 6 years in my startup journey, until I met, out of pure serendipity, one hitchhiker/cyclist/traveler who has been simply travelling with little to no money for last 8 years. I found him so fascinating & crazy, and after listening to his life tales I got an answer to my million dollar questions. Which I would like to share with you all here.\n\nI asked him, dear, how do you manage with literally no money, to cover your long hitchhiking projects? We normal people can\u2019t move an inch without this legal tender.\n\nAnd once you start working on it putting all what you have to offer, with a touch of madness to get it, you get the support in the form of people, network who will be ready to push you forward in your journey. Yes I too need money to travel to have basic food to survive this 3\u20134 months of cycling and hitchhiking assignments, but you know what,\n\n\u201c I have attached a purpose to all my missions, which has to do with the public awareness and which is completely directed to the service of the mankind. Here my passion is to serve and in return I get served and find my fulfillment, which is a kind of dopamine for me to keep walking no matter what obstacles pops up in my way \u201c\n\nThe love and care which I get while travelling and working on engaging communities, largely deprived ones, is what kind of helps me keep going & to survive these challenges which may seem impossible for someone\n\nIt was an amazing conversation which I had with my fellow traveler friend and his life story kind of inspired me a lot. I had a learning which I will be sharing here with everyone who are in the business or serving customers/people in three bullet points\n\nFirst see that you are not in this business by force, but by a choice which syncs well with your passion & purpose. You need to be insanely in love with your work which you do, any half- hearted affair will lead you to compromised journey which will put you into stress and dilemma going forward."

        "title": "The Ones Who Are Crazy Enough \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "The Ones Who Are Crazy Enough\n\nI have created a fictional startup story, to pour out my thoughts based on my personal experience, to coin a journey of a startup, which can be a kind of inspiring and learning experience for all you awesome Bravos who have started Up or are planning to do so. I will frequently be visiting the past and jumping back to present in my narration, so please spare me for my bad grammar.\n\nI Always Feel & Thus Say:\n\nTom(fictitious) decides to do a startup, where his vision is to curate songs and songs related info all at one place and give recommendations to the music lovers based on their taste, location and genre interest. Tom has a very strong creative side to his approach of business, but what he lacks is the ability to complement his creative intelligence with inept technological understanding.\n\nShould he learn to code or should he hunt for the potential tech genius to make a killer techno creative founding team ? Well, Tom decides to partner with one of friend henry(fictitious) who has been working as technologist in one of the biggest software firm. They officially registered a Pvt Ltd Firm. They put the fund of $16,000 distributed equally between the two.They rented a garage for $100 a month where they can accommodate a team of 6\u201310 people. They kick-started the app development process where Henry used to code and Tom used to work on design & UX Part. They managed to pull of the their first working prototype in 3 months and named the app THSongify(fictional name). They launched it on on the play store and apple store and expected to get the decent downloads in 10\u201320 days.\n\nThere were many apps, similar to THSongify which were already ranking pretty high on the store, so for THSongify to get the required visibility & traction needed a master plan for digital marketing. But both of them were sort of budget & also had no prior experience of marketing, one was excellent in product design & strategizing, another was a tech geek, now they started to wonder how to get enough user eyeballs so that their product can amass few loyal users.\n\nHenry told to Tom, Hey Tom, I have a very good friend of mine named Subho(Fictitious), he works as a growth hacker for one of the prominent startup and has done wonders for them. We can try to poach him, but he will cost us high. Tom responded dear Henry, we have $10000 so we can sustain for next 6 Months, let\u2019s take a risk and offer him a paycheck and to cut the cost we can offer him sweat equity.\n\nThey churned out a marketing strategy to help struggling singers to reach out to the masses and in exchange they charged $1 from everyone and also created a separate recommendation list for their app user, where they get the chance to listen fresh & new upcoming voices every week. This new category really picked up where even a common man with good voices were given an opportunity to sing their heart out. Suddenly this app started to pick up in the ranks and to further accelerate the app visibility the triplet founder decided to incentivize their user for every new referral with A Music CD of their Favorite Singing Celebrity. This Idea to promote upcoming singers and to incentivize user helped the app to get enough user attention and app gone viral.\n\nThis Journey Of THSongify which circles around Tom, Henry & Subho now has started to bear fruits. Now THSongify flaunts to be the leading app for all music lovers globally. Now it has more than 100000 licensed content and 500000 user generated content, but now they have very little money and they need to scale their tech infrastructure to support the growing user content & hit request. They need to hire a back-end expert and also need to invest on server side infrastructure. These Triad decided to pull some seed fund from an investor which would hail from the music background. They decided to approach the Leading singing celebrity with an intent to make them their brand ambassador and also as investor to support them in their product growth.\n\nIT was not easy for the triplets, they knocked the door of more than 100 celebrated singers but to no avail. Some told they have a contract to honor and that will not allow them to work exclusively for their company. Some found it risky, some rejected the very idea at the outset. What do you think? Were they going about it with the right approach? No, They too realized the same when they all sat together to give a long thought to what they must be doing wrong. Subho the marketing genius utters Hey Tom! Hey Henry! Are we not deviating from the very vision of our product? Yes Subho we started with a vision to be a platform where even the common man can become a singing sensation, so let\u2019s go back to find one of them, who have done brilliantly on our platform and make them our brand ambassador and ask all of them to fund our startup collectively, after all, now most of them have become a celebrity to some extent and are doing financially well. This approach clicked as all of the common man now a celebrity owed a lot to THSongify and they decided to contribute to pay back the platform with open heart. This gesture brought tears to THSongify founders and they felt fulfilled to see that.\n\nThey managed to overcome the financial crisis by making the singing superstar from their own app to support their mission. This inclusive approach helped them to maintain the financial flow. But Still, they need to have some large investment to fund the song licensing cost which is about to expire and has to be renewed. It costs heavily as the licensing music companies increased the cost for the same. So they decided to cut the same and only be a platform for the common singers who have the talent and want their song to reach to millions of the THSongify users. That was a master stroke, even though, to many of their well wishers, it looked a suicide at one point & mind it, it was not easy for Tom, Henry & Subho too. They had the strong conviction and trust on their product vision to cater the needs of the talented singers. They faced some issue to start with but gradually it faded away and now they are doing fairly well.\n\nTHSongify is now having the backing from one of the leading music licensing company which also decided to do exclusive song albums with the top 10 performing singers on THSongify. THSongify does international live shows now, where they pick the best talent from their platform, helping them to perform and make loads of money for themselves. Now they have floated a new sister concern a subsidiary of THSongify named THS(Tom, Henry & Subho\u2019s) Music Company, which exclusively deals on live shows, doing music albums and also do a music albums for Bollywood movies. Their Journey continues\u2026\u2026..and there are here to stay long as they never fear to innovate and adapt strongly as per the market trends.\n\nWell, I have somehow managed to cut down the long story short, but this journey has many lessons to be learnt.\n\n& many more i leave it for all you to guess and respond..\n\nSome other inspiring stuff from you may find worth reading-\n\nEnding with a sense of gratitude towards all you awesome readers who are my true source of inspiration and compels me to act & write\u2026\n\nAnd, Do Not Forget To Clap\u2026.\n\nTill Then Have Fun & Be A Wise Leaders, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter & Most Importantly Be A Good Human Being."

        "title": "How Technology Has Unified People from All Kinds Of Backgrounds",
        "text": "How Technology Has Unified People from All Kinds Of Backgrounds\n\nYesterday I had a healthy conversation with few enlightened souls in Delhi where we discussed how technology has blurred the line which used to differentiate humans based on cast, creed and wealth status. I thought to share my views, opinions and feelings with all my readers here.\n\nThis topic popped up when one of my colleague was sharing his life story, where he shared how he became a victim of being labelled as washerman\u2019s son even though he is a qualified software engineer. He was disappointed to be called so. On this note our conversation triggered and we analyzed how technology has been playing a major role in abolishing the discrimination\n\nWith the world going digital, opportunities have arisen manifold specially in technology. IT & ITES related services has generated lots of job opportunities for all kinds of talent. Now even a person from poor family can aspire to become a software professional, to experience the journey of rag to riches. There are many such examples around who have made it big by adopting technology related career options, learned the art and changed their fortune. And just because technology has been an enabler in transforming their life underprivileged professionals are no more outcast.\n\nTodays corporate structure embraces lacs and lacs of professionals who come from multiple caste and culture all working together under the single roof. There exist no such discrimination and everyone is given equal opportunity to grow. Now the son of the washerman, taxi driver, street seller, etc\u2026 all can be found rubbing shoulders with privileged one\u2019s with confidence beyond imagination. This has been possible because technology has made all the information accessible at user\u2019s fingertip at dirt cheap price. Now they can learn new things right from their home, educate themselves online to become a qualified professional\n\nThe power of digital communication is democratic, available to all without any differentiation, Internet has empowered everyone to become proficient in the field of their choice. Now the underprivileged one\u2019s have understood the power of technology and are putting their efforts to educate themselves, even though numbers are on the lower side but still it\u2019s encouraging.\n\nWith the mobile gadgets and data packets being available to everyone there has been a significant improvement in lifestyle of human beings. Now the young folks from the weak financial background has started to challenge the status quo and broken all boundaries to acquire the necessary knowledge to go mainstream, as they are making positive and fruitful use of the mobile gadgets to learn, engage, connect and share the information in no time. This unique ability to communicate has boosted their confidence and helped them win their place in this existing societal structure.\n\nTodays digital world is more congenial for anyone to thrive. A new kind of the connected world exists now where anyone can buy & sell their expertise and monetize with minimum expenses. The human intellect has always been free from any kind of cast discrimination which is now quite visible in the working environment around the globe. Now from which background you come hardly matters, now what matters the most is what you can do better, to improve the human life and eventually to improve your own personal life.\n\nYou can start with a small business of selling vegetables and can become an owner of a retail chain by leveraging technology. You can start by driving Ola/Uber and can become an owner of 100 cars yourself using the power of mobility. You can start by washing clothes, to be an owner of a laundry chain clocking millions of revenue/year. There are many such life changing examples all around which are inspiring one & all to break their psychological barrier, to become a power to reckon.\n\nI am not a specialist so whatever i have penned is just my free opinion and understanding of life so far. If anything doesn\u2019t fit well with anyone please spare me for that."

        "text": "3 Key Lessons From My Book Of Life\n\nLife will test you to like hell, it will try to off-balance you, it will try to bold you out. You just need to make your choices right and defend as challenges comes your way, with a weapon which is strong and sharp enough to safeguard your choices you made consciously. The more you will be living in the present moment with mind,eyes and ear wide open you will become receptive to all the opportunities which will come as a complimentary gift with all those trying moments.\n\nIt has been 6 years now and it feels like I have just started, this entrepreneurial journey has not been easy so far, but that\u2019s the beauty of being an entrepreneur, it will test you, reject you, but at the same time help you learn and be a new person with every small success and failures which comes across. Many a times I felt like giving up as there were severe financial pressure and adversity which almost succeeded to convince that it is not worth, but but\u2026. I always went to my childhood day memories to seek inspiration.\n\nAs a child, I was adamant not to give up and always tried hard things which seems impossible, I was good at sports which taught me that the outcome is not in my control but giving my best shot was always in my control. I gave my best and sometimes won and sometimes lost, but the enthusiasm never faded, I took inspiration from the fact that as a child, I used to always question why I failed and answer came every time I inquired with mind wide open.\n\nSo today I would share 3 important learnings of my life which has helped me to sustain and grow out from adversity.\n\nYou know what ? We need to keep a child awake in our life if we want to go long in whatever endeavor we decide for ourself. As a child, we lived our life with curiosity to learn, we were always so enthusiastic about everything which came our way which helped us learn and grow, similarly as grown up it is our responsibility that we keep alive our basic human nature of asking questions and learning as we evolve.\n\nAn attitude that we know nothing & that we still need to learn a lot irrespective of our position and power will help you live this life as a student who never grow old and is never short of enthusiasm to act.\n\nWhen you grow up, your life will throw lots of questions which you need to answer yourselves, specially deciding your profession can seem to be a daunting task. Here you need to make decisions not based on others opinion , yes, you can seek the guidance, but ultimately you need to listen to your inner calling. Never suppress yourselves to do something which you never wanted . Make your decision based on what your heart feels right. Your choices you will make is going to decide how your life will shape up for you, so when you know this fact why not make a chocie which will keep you in blissful state of mind and help you sail through this life the way you want."

        "text": "Do You Have Enough Hunger To Succeed?\n\nNobody in this world wants to be a failure isn\u2019t it? Being human we have all the tools at our disposal to become what we want. Having said that, I am also aware that not many people are happy about what they are. They consider themselves to be a loser and are not able to come out of that self labelled tag.\n\nIt is ok to feel bad about not being able to do what you intent to, but it is also important to see, What you have? And What you can do? to change that status. Is it difficult? Yes, only if you simply dwell upon it and wait for someone to pull you out of your trouble. Waiting for things to improve is like praying to GOD to help you improve your financial situation without working hard on your part.\n\nNot at all, in fact, it should be your problems, your weaknesses which should encourage you, inspire you to take right actions with the right intent. You just need to be focussed enough to Identify what is coming in your way and have the grit to persist without changing your goals, to fight out, to grow out.\n\nI have experienced that most of the time we just act randomly without having any specific milestones to reach. It is a universal problem and not much is being done about it, we individually are not having the guts to face the challenges. You need to first find the reason or purpose of being alive, then look for the resources which will be required to get you kick-started on your mission. Yes, you will be needing help in your journey for change, but that is only possible when you first take that very first step to Start-Up.\n\nThere is no good or bad situations, you were born to succeed, but as you started to grow up, you started to live unrealistically, ignoring the facts of life and living in a dream world. Initiatives are missing, there is no such deep hunger to get rid of your trouble if it exists. A Major portion of our time is being wasted in complaining, in bitching, judging, in concluding, in crying. Most of these emotions gets sourced from our own weakness, but we seldom accept that and feel that the world outside is terrible and is not favorable for us to thrive and succeed.\n\nSo it is important that we go inward, ponder what best resources we have in our kitty, questions our skill-sets, work upon those, learn that skills, ask help if required, set a long-term goal, divide them into milestones, work hard for it, value every second we have, spent it wisely, value relationship while you are hustling as you will be needing that moral support in your moment of despair. Love yourself for what you are are, don\u2019t compare, have least expectations from your actions and keep track of your directions to ensure you are going in the right direction.\n\nNothing is perfect in this whole creation and it is the beauty of this entire universe, so are we, we can\u2019t be everything, we can\u2019t be perfect, but one thing is for sure, we can try to become something if we really want it badly. What is that you want, has to be decided now and chased with a sole motto to walk, while you are doing so, your destination can change and so you have to act accordingly.\n\nI am quite a dynamic person myself and have committed lots of mistakes in my startup journey so far, I failed twice in my startup initiatives, No I didn\u2019t quit, I learned, changed the approach, pivoted the business model, adapted to the current market needs and kept on fighting. Has my struggle come to an end, no, not at all, but my internal being has stopped struggling from within, I am most of the time blissed out and happy for what I am having and what I have achieved, having said that, my hunger is always at its extreme level to explore, to learn, to help, to share, to care, to live this precious piece of life I am bestowed with. Is my life perfect ? Not at all, I have my own problems, my own disappointments, but all that has to do with my own self and I know that it is a part and parcel of being human.\n\nYour are alive that\u2019s success, you are taking actions that\u2019s success, you accumulated enough wealth to experience the luxury of being rich, it\u2019s a success, you have enough to share that\u2019s success. You have accepted the life in its true sense and working fearlessly you are a success.\n\nYou are not happy for not having it all, you are not putting enough blood and sweat to get what you want, you expect a lot from others, you curse yourself for not being born rich, you have enough, but do not share, you want others to make your life happening, then you are for sure wasting this life and will remain poor, deprived, starving and unhappy lifelong.\n\nThanks for reading and making my life truly beautiful & blissful\u2026.."

        "text": "Being alive in this 21st century is a blessing in terms of opportunity and scale one wants to attain in his personal and professional life. You can specialize or learn multiple skills in one or many domains and can make a blossoming career out of it. If you are a rebel who loves to solve problems and feels like building your own strong team and a startup around it, this is the best time to be alive.\n\nIn my short career span of 13+ years I have worn multiple hats and have executed many small and big tech products, seen so extreme failures, experienced the bliss of succeeding in some and have served many promising startups as a consultant. I have had some great realizations and learnings, which is felt worth sharing. Medium has been a platform for me to pour out my thoughts without any baggage and filters and i am extremely fascinated by it.\n\nToday I am gong to share one very important lesson of my startup journey so far, which can be a kind of some help to all you aspiring Millennials who are looking to make it big in the coming future.\n\nI have understood after my own failures & success that to build a sustainable and scalable business, you need to drop your ego first, especially when you are teaming up with different minds to be your \u201cpartner in vision\u201d. Startup is built on the core foundation of trust & love, where all brains have to be in absolute harmony with each other, to function. Yes, there will be differences of opinion, but the vision has to be absolutely clear to everyone involved.\n\nIt is perfectly healthy to argue on product ideation, but if that is done to be dominant over the other it will lead to ego clashes. When ego starts playing over your mind, then the conflict of interest takes over, now you become more self-centered in your leadership, and it percolates down deeply to damage the entire startup ecosystem. Now the sheer love of building a startup is taken over by the ego, which only works to break the things.\n\nYour ego has the following negative impact :\n\nWhen you are in the business of serving others the first thing you need to keep aside is your ego.\n\nNever ever let it pop up while you are serving your clients, you need to bury it deep down,never allowing it to come back. Your clients or customers seek ,trust worthy service provider who can understand their needs, and to have such deep understanding you need to listen to him like a child who never judges and is extremely curious, you need to be a silent listener whose mind is not capped but wide open. Then only you will be in a position to offer the right solutions to their problem.\n\nSo if you are a startup founder one thing which you need to drop immediately or practice is that, if you really want to succeed in this current market, where survival is less a challenge, but to sustain and scale is extremely challenging, you need to serve your team, your customers and loved ones selflessly.\n\nI have observed that Ego always takes away and looks to be fed while if you give something with a sense of love you tends to feed others."

        "title": "3 Mistakes Of My Startup Life & What I Learned From Them",
        "text": "3 Mistakes Of My Startup Life & What I Learned From Them\n\nI have committed many mistakes in my startup journey so far, some were a real eye opener, so today I thought to share some of the crucial learnings I had which I would like to fix if given a second chance but the reality is quite different and i have moved on successfully.\n\nHope my learning can help you aspiring entrepreneurs in some way.\n\nI Never Did The Required Due Diligence Before Selecting My Founding Partners\n\nI still wish I could have gone back to the those days when we were setting up the foundation for our company. But the reality is quite different, it\u2019s only a wish after all. Why have I made this confession?Well, there is a profound learning, which I felt like sharing with all of you, to give some essence of what you should do when you are looking to team up with your potential \u201cpartner in journey\u201d.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you select your partner who complements you both skill wise and as a person. You need to spend sufficient time together before getting into the decision of floating a startup, at least ask 100+ foolish or wise questions to each other. Nothing has to be left behind and everything has to be brought to the table with all the due diligence required. Everyone has to be clear what they will be doing together as a team and about the risk and challenges they will have to overcome when they will hustle out together.\n\nI Underestimated The Need Of Having A Business Blueprint & Went Quite Unplanned Into Managing all my startup Affairs.\n\nNo, you should never ever start executing, until you have figured out, the well thought & diligently planned business blueprint of your Idea. Leaving anything to chance will only shorten your chance to succeed. Yes planning 100% at the start is not practical, but that doesn\u2019t mean you go about it blindly. You need to set out a long term plan(Vision Statement) & a short term milestones, all well documented so that you can better forecast your expenses and expected returns. If anything is not aligned well with your business goals, you can always go back to plan X.. To pivot & change the required business model.\n\nI Neglected My Health & Family While I Was Hustling It Out\n\nThe biggest learning of my 6 year journey has been that, you can\u2019t neglect your health & family while you are building your startup. They need to be standing with you and you need to be standing with them while you are facing the uncertainty, you can\u2019t be a superhuman to do it all alone without sourcing an inspiration from your most trusted sources.\n\nCliche \u201c Health Is Wealth \u201c Is a very powerful statement and will always be very relevant no matter what is your profession.\n\nApart from health you always need to make sure you don\u2019t forget to spend some quality time with yourself and your beloved ones, whenever you get to do so. You can\u2019t do away with the statement that I hardly get a time, it is not true and you always try to fool yourself with this vague statement. Time has always been available, we just forget to prioritize it as per need.\n\nFamily members never need your money they only need that valuable moment together where you express love & care for each other.\n\nHope these mistakes can offer some kind of guidance to those young aspiring souls who are planning to StartUp & If it resonates well with you all, please feel free to share back your feelings with me. You can also put forth your learning so that it can enlighten someone who may be needing it more\u2026\n\nEnding by, extending my sincere gratitude to all you awesome readers who have been showering all your love & constantly inspiring me to write more & learn more eventually."

        "text": "The more we are entangled to the social media apps and gadgets, the more fake our personality is becoming. Have you wondered why it is happening? Well It should not be too difficult to find answers because you somehow already know from deep inside who to blame for this duality in your life. You are more living a life with lots of mask on your faces which you find convenient enough to change as per the need of the situation. The real you, is lost in this digital black hole which has a stronger pull to make you feel helpless. You want to come out of this hole, but feeling powerless in front of it. You have completely surrendered to the glory it has to offer. This progressive digital world has doped you, so deep, that now you are struggling hard to get back to your original identity.\n\nWhen you start hating yourself for all your weakness which seldom exists in reality, you start drugging yourself with social media stuffs, to pacify yourself, to look strong and to become someone or something which you are not in reality. Your engagement with real life stuffs, real people has somehow been curtailed by this powerful mobile gadget and its rich app ecosystem. Now all you are doing is to switch to your phone screen to get entertained or to live all your life emotions.\n\nIs the gadget or apps are to blame? No I don\u2019t feel so, gadgets and apps were supposed to be a tool to help us live better, but we are using it for all wrong reasons and feel that it is the whole world for us. We have dropped all our intelligence and surrendered to this small piece of technology which is now running our mind. All these devices and apps came into existence to save our time, energy and money, see, now it is taking out all our energy, time & money to make us more poorer. We are getting drained, without sweating hard by the bombardment of the information all around us.\n\nEvery new innovation done by humans was done to help us scale, to be more progressive and to be more creative in our approach. It was done to help you learn more in lesser time . To help you connect across the borders to so that you can expand your network and grow your knowledge to new heights. To reach the unreachable, to do some work which was not possible earlier. To help you fly, To help you express your hidden potential. It was supposed to make you more real and powerful.\n\nPerhaps we missed the whole point and started to use it for hiding ourself under our skin, to live multiple life wearing multiple masks. It\u2019s a time that we rediscover the joy of being alive and start living more in the real world playing real games on the ground, engaging with real people outside and most importantly being authentic in whatever we do.\n\nTo live with authenticity will always make you fearless and emotionally strong, come out of your virtual world and take charge of your life, learn to accept rejections, share your emotions with real people not with dumb devices which can only stir false emotions to fool you more."

        "text": "To Be Successful, Be Honest, Speak Up And Ask For The Help?\n\nToday I would like to talk about that feeling of being lost, where we sometimes feel stuck and like going nowhere. We need help in that moment of distress, but somehow prefer to keep it to ourself and suffer. I have personally experienced that when you try to hold your feelings instead of expressing it, you put yourself into a state of silent depression. There is a difference in being introvert and feeling lost & depressed. I have my own learning which helped me get out of this phase and I would like to share this with an intent to inspire you all in my possible capabilities.\n\nIt was a hard feeling and I didn\u2019t have a clue how to come out of it. It was not that everything was wrong outside, it was my inner state of being which was kind of bothering me, there was something which was not ok with me, even though I was trying to look strong on the outside but I was kind of feeling weak from inside, So what I did? I turned up to someone very close to me whom I admire a lot for his wisdom and silently accepted him as a mentor. Is he aware of it, no, I never revealed.\n\n\u201cI reached out to him seeking his appointment and said I need to share something important, if you can spare some time for me it would be so kind of you . He responded, anytime you can come and we can discuss\u201c\n\nI met him and poured my heart out. I simply expressed how I was feeling from within about the way life was shaping up for me and that I was not happy with whatever I was doing. I spoke about my challenges in running my business and also how I was feeling like stuck in the journey. Yes, I was sounding quite vulnerable in that moment, but never tried to suppress my feelings and expressed quite openly to him. I knew I was in a right company who has always helped me and guided me whenever I needed it .\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with you it is just that you are holding lots of stuff within you, now that you have spoken it out, you will feel better.\n\n\u201c Dear Pramod it is fine to go wrong, but it is precarious if you know it and dwell upon it. If you know the problem there is always a solution, there will always be 3 scenarios to see into your situation:"

        "text": "Why \u201cI Don\u2019t Know \u201c Can Be A Blessing ?\n\nI have a confession to make, \u201cI Don\u2019t Know \u201d enough & what i know is a spec, and I am extremely curious to know the unknown. Have I found the answer, not at all, Will I continue doing so, yes for sure ,\n\nFor the world, I am a qualified technology professional, but for me that is just a tag and nothing more than that, which I am ok with, as it takes care of my survival in this existence. And I know that, it is also required if I really want to know the unknown, To know new things or to explore new dimensions of this life, i need to be alive, until my survival is ensured, my curiosity to know more and my hunger to explore will not find its true expression.\n\nI also know that whatever I know can never be the truth for anyone else to believe or follow\n\nWhen I say to lot many people, who find me wise & comes to me asking a solution for their life related issues, I say, how can I know what\u2019s wrong with you. I straight forward say it is your problem and you should be aware about the reason, you should be the one having answers. I recommend them that I may advise on something which is under my experience, but it will only be an empty one with no substance, as it is coming from my own life experiences. They somehow feel offended, and go away with long faces, but that\u2019s what is the reality.\n\nNot knowing is an absolute blessing as it empowers me to explore new possibility and so you should also drop all your knowledge if you really want to add some new dimension to your rotten life, or to know something which is not in your personal experience yet. It can be anything like learning new technology, exploring new adventure, or an inquiry of your existence. To find answers you must first drop all your intelligence & your so called knowledge, it is a pure fallacy and can never open a door to anything new you are seeking.\n\nOne thing which I know for sure is that all my skills and knowledge is very limited and miniscule, it has no such value to be shared or to be offered as an advise. I know for sure, that I have lot many things to learn and explore and that can only be possible when I am on the lifelong expedition to know the thyself in its full possibility. I am not alive simply to live through, I do have the purpose on this earth, that purpose has nothing to do with the external acquisition, all what I gained while doing my deeds is helping me to survive but this is not what I feel I am here for. I am still in pursuit of it and journey of inquiry will not stop, for sure I know that.\n\nIf you, too, are in this pursuit of knowing your life in its entirety, you should also be concerned about what you know and what you don\u2019t. You need to be honest enough to claim anything, as it may create a wall which will stop you to know the reality of your very existence. Your purpose is way beyond your limited knowledge and being born as human, you need to break all those false boundaries which are stopping you to know the reality.\n\nFor the ages this egoistic knowledgeable person who claims to know it all, based on the bookish knowledge has mislead us to believe in things which was far beyond reality, they themselves never experienced the same and made others follow. Yes, you got it right, I am talking about so called religious gurus and sages who read few Religious books and memorized it thoroughly to fool you being a super knowledgeable person. And us ignorant fools without questioning, thought it to be true, just because we heard it from someone who we considered to be knowing .\n\nWe were forced to join our hands in front of the man-made idols right from our childhood, even though none of our elders knew the truth and had any personal experience of God\u2019s existence. But they did the same and told us to do the same. Such a crap, that very kid, a true life bursting with exuberance who simply can\u2019t believe seeing this lifeless idol and wanted to take them home if allowed to simply play with it, are somehow made to bow down or join their hands. They just imitated the gesture because they trusted their fathers to be the person with knowledge and accepted what they told or did\n\nWhy I am raising this question, is because I have personally questioned this very practice right from my childhood and met with disappointments to see lot of miserable things happening around me, just in the name of GOD. It is not a question of GOD\u2019s existence, it\u2019s a question of our own true existence and what you want to do with it. I never found myself to fit into all these false dogmas, and I still have no issues whatsoever to be labelled as atheist, it works for me after all.\n\nI know for sure that I will be an ignorant being, who knew nothing.The only things which are in my knowledge is that there is a life in me who knows to breathe and go silent at will. Yes, I will not stop performing my duties in my professional and personal life as that is my only way to give back to what I have been gifted with and that very act of knowing more, questioning more and being ignorant will always be my true pursuit of knowing the unknown.\n\nAgain, it is not at all advisable to believe what i have written without any filters here, please put your knowledge if that is the case to draw your own line to follow. Spare me for my ignorance if something doesn\u2019t resonate well with you."

        "title": "What Is Not True About Blockchain ? \u2013",
        "text": "What Is Not True About Blockchain ?\n\nBeing a blockchain enthusiast i am so intrigued by this decentralized technology and extremely fascinated by its power to change the way data used to be stored and authenticated. For the first time any two parties who wants to transact can come to consensus and transact value in the form of a digital asset(digital currency) without, paying any transaction fee and any third party intervention. This No-Trust system is going to be the most trusted and secured mechanism of digital data authentication and data storage in the coming few years, where data will be safe, verified and secure .\n\nThe world is talking about Bitcoin and many others digital cryptocurrency and how it is disrupt the currency market in the coming decade or so. But what is more exciting is the technology of Blockchain which is much more valuable than the digital asset it is empowering. Now businesses or individuals can exchange or sign contracts digitally, where these contracts are embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision. Future world will have contracts, processes, tasks, payment all being digitized with a unique & secure signature which can identified, verified, validated, stored forever & will be tamper proof. Such a massive potential this blockchain wave will have to create a much deeper impact on everything and everyone.\n\nI have already covered a lot about cryptocurrency and blockchain fundamentals in the past. I have discussed with all of you about\n\n& much more, But today we will try to understand:What Is Not true for the Blockchain?\n\nAs it is known that the technology at the heart of bitcoin, ripple, litecoin and other virtual currencies is blockchain, which is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. But what you don\u2019t know is that\n\nBitcoin is not a Blockchain and Vice-versa. Bitcoin in reality sits at the top of the blockchain like our apps sits on the top of the database. Where apps does all transaction to store & access the data into the database structure, similarly blockchain holds all the bitcoin transactions records which can be verified. Bitcoin is a pure digital currency which uses the blockchain as underlying tech to use it as a database ledger.\n\nBusiness blockchain manages digital identity with priority and makes and picks up some selective transactions as compared to bitcoins which utilizes intensive Proof of Work, which is quite resource intensive.\n\nAgain as we discussed earlier blockhchain cannot be a digital currency like bitcoin as it is mainly a database which holds transaction records. It is similar to say that mongoDb the database behind paypal is not a currency.\n\nMany Decentralized Apps are being built on blockchain where it is acting like fabric but the blockchain itself is not that app or a product. These products use it as a utility and is mainly built on top of it.\n\nTo be able to replace our currently existing transaction mechanism blockchain has to fulfill some important critieria like :\n\nIf all the above value and criteria is met than only it can a candidate to replace our conventional transaction system else it will be too early to say that it can replace it fully.\n\nCurrently many apps are built over this distributed database technology and this tech works wonderful where there is no need of business network, so Blockchain being a decentralized database can complement it well, but can\u2019t replace it fully, because of its limitation to work on large business network.\n\nYes it has scaled to fast too quickly as compoared to TCP/IP Inernet Wave but it has yet to go through that gestation period where we can say it has fully matured and is widely accepted just like internet wave. For blockchain to revolutionise this digital arena needs to overcome many challenges , technology, governance, society, businesses all has to come together to make it a phenomenon. Yes it may take another 10\u201315 years if not more to attain to that level where it will be completely sweeping the digital wave. If it takes less than what i am predicting it is going to be really a game changer for all the stakeholders who will be the beneficiary of this blockchain revolution.\n\nNow that you know what not the blockchain is, let me explain\n\nTo help you explain in more simplified manner, i have a Infographics for you which has been sourced from Blockchainhub.\n\nI have a feeling that no businesses can afford, in the coming future to compete in this ever changing market without adopting this blockchain revolution. Yes the early movers advantage will play a major role to decide the winners and the losers. So it is a time that you start now, may not be at larger scale, but with smaller investment within your organization to experiment with data management using blockchain. Also you can involve existing bitcoin payment mechanism in your eCommerce or in a game. You should not risk now on building your own network if that it not what suits your risk appetite but it can be a smart move to use the existing Blockchain As A service(BaaS) or Blockchain enabling platform to develop you own business solution over it.\n\nThanks For Reading, Keep Loving , Keep Investing\u2026. On what, you can decide !"

        "text": "Are You Making Wrong Choices To Be Miserable !\n\nThe stress has taken over you because you want instant gratifications and results for your input, which in reality is not at all your doing. If we can choose to be gratified with our effort and focus on what we have gained in terms of learning our life will be rich in every sense.\n\nAt workplace, we are always stressed out, focus is less on planning the work and more on how much money we will make out of it, it is not bad to to think of your monetary welfare, but problem is the choice we make unconsciously, If we choose learning and skill enhancement over money, the end benefit will always be your financial upliftment.\n\nWhy it happens is but obvious, we are more result oriented, we always think what will we get if we do this and what if things doesn\u2019t go as per plan, we give unwanted attention to situations which only occurs in our imaginary world. We have a psychological fear of an outcome which is yet to happen and which has nothing to do with the reality.\n\nOur life is less organized more a chaos and so are the choices and decisions we are making. As a child, we never gave a damn to what makes us happy and what makes us sad, We always chose to be happy and expressed our rage if things were not according to us, the best thing was we never took the baggage of outcome from our actions. But we grown up\u2019s somehow has forgotten that skill and given up, totally against the adverse circumstances.\n\nLife is a wholesome of letter B, C,D, where B= Birth D= Death is not your making but C=choices, is what you need to make wisely to be truly alive.\n\nLet me tell a story of a very talented boy Pinto (name is fictitious) to help you understand how we can make right and informed choices to make our blessed life even more blissful.\n\nPinto used to be very unconventional about everything he did, during his academics, he used to escape and go hitchhiking, long-road trip was a kind of fun for him, he was good at sports & adventure, average at studies, overall his life was cool. As he was graduating he started planning for a his dream career, he loved to travel & capture memories in his camcorder, so he always dreamed to be a travel blogger, but he was a kind of perplexed, his family was pushing him to take engineering graduation from a reputed college & be a software engineer so that he could get into big corporate job where his future will would be more stable & secure, well every parents dream so, but this was a quite daunting situation for Peter to decide upon , he has to make a choice between Happiness one for himself and one for his family which nurtured him to the level where he is now a grown up adult and can even choose.\n\nDid he chose to be a travel blogger or a computer professional. Well It indeed was a difficult one, as he was grown up adult and he was supposed to be rational in his choice, he has an expectation to fulfil so what if it goes against him at-least he would not disappoint his beloved parents, but peter made a wise move, he took to a corporate job, but always kept his dream alive of capturing life, so he went to the company owner and spoke about his dream project.\n\nHe told to Jack(Fictional) that he wants to build a Product which captures the life of travelers and shares their experience as a recommendations to the fellow travelers, it will help them plan their trip with all the information at their disposal & in-order to make their trip an awesome & hassle free this product will facilitate them to even book hotels at the location of their choice based on fellow traveler recommendations.\n\nPinto insisted to the Jack that he needs to do market Research before he can present the product plan in detail, Jack was kind of hooked seeing Pinto\u2019s passion for this idea and the energy which he radiated while presenting the case to him. He gave him a Nod to Kick-start and his journey began. He travelled extensively, observing keenly the fellow travelers, what they ate? Where they hang out? What comforted them? What put them in tricky situations? Where they spent money on? etc.. etc.\n\nHe prepared the set of 200\u2013300 questions which he asked and recorded the answers in his survey software which he specially built for that. With all the information at his disposal, he came back to Jack with his presentation ready where he very diligently put all the product features based on his R&D and also how the product will be monetized in terms of business model. As he already had the details of 4\u20135K travelers, which he collected by being a mate to them and engaging with them over existing social platform, he had all the data points to work upon his product.\n\nJack gave thumbs up to the product idea, Product MVP was built based on market research and as it hit the market it did pretty well and from thereon Pinto went on to become the Co-founder of the same product which he built for his Company. Currently Pinto owns a chain of backpackers hostels & a travel portal where he shares his experiences and also the stories of the travelers who stays at his premium hostel, all of them are giving enough ROI to make him feel fulfilled.\n\nFrom his duties having enough fuel to live through his life & yes, he has his own family with one daughter Bella(Fictional) . He made a conscious choice to enjoy the fruits of his ingenious work, so now he mentors other dreamers and supports them in building their own dream project by investing his time money & energy.\n\nHe continues to live happily with his family & parents giving them sufficient love & care, also fathering a daughter, yes he do have his challenges and sometimes he is emotionally drained, but he handles the situation smartly based on his past wisdom of handling the expectations & choices of his own. He always ensures his decision is not made by force, but by the choice & he takes it with full accountability. Now he doesn\u2019t have to choose between work or life, work-life balance is not a kind of question which bothers him anymore, he understands that -\n\nEnding by, extending my sincere gratitude to all you awesome readers for showering all your love & constantly inspiring me to write more.\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

I can\u2019t forget that day it was so surreal, she was beautifully clad, like a queen, glittering like diamonds and when she reached just near the elevated stage, she looked straight into my eyes for a microsecond and that was enough to express all the emotions she preserved for this very special moment of her life, it is still so fresh in my memory. I can make it out that she was nervous on one side as she was concerned about her parents, on the flip side, she was ecstatic too, she wanted to say a lot, but was holding somehow, but her eyes were sending an intense message wrapped with an emotion of pure love.\n\nWe have navigated through many ups and downs and are about to celebrate our 10th anniversary, in all these years we have shared many heart-melting moment, and also the moments of distress where we argued and expressed our dissatisfaction in words we found best suited for that moment, but one thing still remains unchanged, when it comes to expressing our emotion full of love & care we relied on silence to be our communicator. It has always worked wonders for us and has given some magical moments.\n\nEvery morning when I am all set to leave for my office, she hardly utter a word saying \u201cBye\u201d she prefers to keep silent, she comes to the balcony on the first floor and see me off with a blink of an eye with a message to \u201cdrive safe and come back home I will be waiting eagerly\u201d . I find this relationship to be a kind of meditation, which triggers my hidden happiness to reach to its extreme level of bliss and put\u2019s me into a kind of Flow. This flow helps me to perform at my supreme best.\n\nI have a strong message to convey to all you awesome readers who are currently reading this article with the intense silence within you and who can feel the \u201c Love to be in the air\u201d .\n\nEndorsing the silence is in no way a recommendation that you never speak up, it is just that some emotions are well expressed being silent. If you feel like you need to speak your heart out, don\u2019t stop, let yourself be free and express what you feel. Relationship is a kind of understanding where both are committed unconditionally, so if your emotions are correct & strong enough, you can easily say your words or express your emotions in a way you feel comfortable and that should work fine for you."

        "title": "Have You Got Your Fundamentals Right Before Professional Engagement ?",
        "text": "Have You Got Your Fundamentals Right Before Professional Engagement ?\n\nI very often wonder why things go wrong ? Why service provider ends up messing the project? Was it the wrong choice of the service provider ? Was it the lack if preparation or planning on client\u2019s part or on the part of service provider? Was it the issue of skill-set on developer\u2019s part ? Why this relationship which started on a great note met this fate ? As a technology consultant and also as a business owner, I have a few key observation on the same. There are some fundamentals which gets ignored in the process of contract and process finalization which kind of leads to this outcome.\n\nNo service provider wants to see their clients getting into trouble nor the client wants to trouble their service provider, it\u2019s just that there is some lack of planning before getting into the development stage at both ends, which leads to the chaos and some unwanted miss-communication. This situation which pops up dynamically gets handled in a bad way, curtailing the project life cycle to reach its ultimate state of completion.\n\nBefore jumping into the discussion with any professional service provider you need to ensure that you are absolutely clear about what you want to be developed. If you are not qualified enough(which is the case with many service seekers) be humble enough to take third party opinion or hire any professional independent consultant who has the prior experience of project planning, conceiving and managing the project and has the core technical expertise on the same domain in which you want your project to be developed.\n\nYou need to document everything right before you discuss your first draft. Also, you need to have a basic initial draft in place to be discussed with the consultant so that he can work with you closely to finalize the project plan, covering, technology, technical feasibility, timelines, milestones and cost breakups. This can also be further discussed with the agency when you get into finalizing those. Having prior readiness will cut short the time and help you reach the decision much faster.\n\nConsultant can also help you connect to the right technology company as they frequently work closely with them on client\u2019s behalf, which I feel makes lots of sense as it saves a lot of time which goes into talent hunting.\n\nUntil you are flexible & understanding enough to see, that you can\u2019t fix everything at the outset and there will be realistic changes popping up out of blue, you may get frustrated and take any rash decisions which can be futile for the project. So it is very important that our minds are wide open to adapt to the changes as it comes our way.\n\nThat is why it is recommended that project is done in phases and milestone which gives the scope of being flexible in planning and implementing without any chaos.\n\nThe Project has to be broken into milestones and each phase needs to be well documented without failing, it has to be well recorded somewhere to refer back whenever required. We very often ignore the documentation part and at the last moment left startled.\n\nThe code base has to be frequently reviewed and stored in the repository. Client can take some third party opinion for code structuring and optimization, which may cost a few extra bucks but it is worth. This helps in ensuring the project coding is following the state of art coding standards. Also, this expert can provide some extra help when the team feels stuck.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in asking for help, it is perfectly human."

        "title": "What It Takes To Be Truly Fearless ? \u2013",
        "text": "What It Takes To Be Truly Fearless ?\n\nTo Be Truly Fearless You Need To Act Responsibly Based on What You Know And Be Wise Enough To Learn What You Don\u2019t. Believing something which is not in your pedigree of experience leads to ignorance and fear.\n\nOnce there was a man Called \u201dShrivats\" who decided to win over his fear and to attain to that state he decided to go to the jungle & to build his small cottage right in between where precarious wild animals used to wander around quite frequently. He built his abode and started to live there. He never got distracted by the roaring sounds of lions or other animals, he simply sat unmoved whenever they came near to him, even when the poisonous snakes used to wrangle him around, he remained standstill with no expression of fear. It became a play for him to live around them, slowly this very act of fearlessness caught attention of the nearby villagers and they started to preach him, as they found him to be the real man with some extraordinary power.\n\nOne day one sage decided to meet this fearless soul with a curiosity to know how one can attain this state of absolute fearlessness. He visited to his cottage to find him sitting naked on the rock which was nearby to his abode. He went to him and out of excitement said, can i ask one question to you ? Shrivats responded why not, dear, go ahead ! The sage asked How can I find the Almighty ? Shrivats responded with a subtle smile on his face, to find the God You need to be absolutely fearless and only then you can attain to the state where you can discover the almighty.\n\nSuddenly a monstrous lion popped out of the blue and started to roar strongly standing right behind Shrivats. The Sage got terrified, trembled with fear and started to sweat. Seeing this Shrivats laughed and spoke, for a sage like you, it is not right to be fearful and sweating. Sage in that moment of fear requested Shrivats to offer him some water so that he can regain his energy and run out of the jungle to safeguard himself. Shrivats decided to go inside his cottage to pick some water for the sage, in that very moment Sage picked up the white chalk and wrote some holy religious mantra on the rock on which Shrivats used to sit and meditate.\n\nAs Shrivats came back with a bowl full of water and was about to climb the rock with his feet, he suddenly pulled back and fell down seeing the holy mantra inscribed on the rock. Sage laughed back at him and said, I thought you are an absolute fearless man. But the truth is that Even you are not truly fearless, I am sorry, but you are not truly liberated, you are still far away from being the enlightened and fearless soul. You are still chained strongly with your belief system which has rotten long way back and living an estranged and strangled life. Fearless people are completely free from all kind of dogmas but in your case it seems different.\n\nI consider my fear much better than yours atleast it is realistic the sage said and left the jungle\n\nWith the story, it is quite clear that if you need to win over your fear you have to do it at your psychological level, at your mental level . You fear of fire is normal and you need to be wise enough to protect yourself otherwise you will be a fool and can kill yourself. Being fearless doesn\u2019t mean that you lose your mind to prove yourself brave and put yourself in a dangerous position. The True, fearless state is a state where you liberate yourself from the belief system and live in reality. You need to get rid of those crappy religious beliefs which tells you that if you forget to bow your head down in front of any temple passing by, you may get into trouble, that fear is unrealistic and impractical.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in preaching the creator, but it is a foolish practice to believe that he exist in any physical form which humans created & he may get angry if you missed to offer a prayer to this form. This psychological fear/drama of your mind has to be mastered and you need to first win over your unrealistic practices which has been taught to you from centuries. Until you get rid of this superstitious practices you will never be living the life in its true sense."

        "text": "It Is Good To Startup But It Is Wise To See If You Can Pull It Through ?\n\nEvery day, millions of Ideas get implanted into the heads of ingenious rebels, who dreams to work upon their own startup idea. Out of these only few bravo\u2019s take that first step forward to make their idea actionable out of which only 1\u20135 % are able to pull it through all the obstacles to build a sustainable business out of it. So what happens to those 90\u201395 % startup which somehow not managed to cross the required gestation period from where they would have managed to survive, what curtailed their journey short, why they struggled to survive.\n\nToday I will try to share few dark realities of building and running a startup which I have personally experienced while I was hustling hard to build my own castle, Yes, I managed to survive, but learned many hard lessons on the way and also while interacting with many budding startup entrepreneurs and working with them closely, listening to their tales of struggles and failures.\n\nFounder\u2019s were not competent but they never realized or accepted the truth eventually they never put their effort in learning the art of building a durable startup. They never worked hard to be a salesman, to be an HR, to be a coder. They procrastinated and refrained from having the first hand experience of what they wanted to develop or build.\n\nThey were more like an accidental entrepreneur who took the decision to StartUp not because they were crazy enough and skilled enough, but because they were weak and incompetent and were somehow forced to be into this startup hype. They started up not because they were concerned to solve any prominent problems, but to escape this demanding corporate world.\n\nMany of these startup\u2019s never had the business model which could have generated enough food to help it survive. These startups were starving and crawling from the very beginning and also their founders were not so financially competent and secure to provide the emergency relief to help it breathe.\n\nThe very oxygen, the money was missing from their bank, to be true the whole Idea sucked, founder\u2019s never realized the same and somehow tried to run it without pivoting to the new model or pushing a restart button or timing it right to shut the door. Ego and their fear of being exposed clouded their wisdom and delayed their decision to give it a call.\n\nTackling problems that are interesting to solve, rather than those that serve a market need was cited as the \u21161 reason for failure, noted in 42% of cases.\n\nYour Startup is as good as your founding team, and if that very foundation lacked the required skills, it is bound to grow weak over the period of time and one day it will crack down heavily. I have found that most of the startup who failed had a weak team who were not competent and skilled enough to even build their MVP thyself. A team with a diverse set of skill sets is very often critical to the startup success."

        "title": "Why Your Commitment Fails ? \u2013",
        "text": "In order to be fully committed you have to first accept yourself in your true existence. You have to drop being someone or something else. You are already someone and so trying to be someone else is a pure fallacy.\n\nUntil you accept yourself you can\u2019t discover, the very discovery starts once you accept what you are. When you stop being anything else beyond your existence, you attain to the truth and get\u2019s enlightened. With this enlightenment you act just right, you act enough to discover, to explore and to harness your human potential to its fullest capabilities. You become committed first to yourself and then to the actions which you delegate without any strings attached.\n\nYour pure commitment becomes your fruit and you start relishing it in all its forms & flavours, you fall in love with yourself and makes all your surroundings blissful and congenial for others to be happy.\n\nBeing committed(samarpan) is only possible when you detach yourself from the outcome of your actions. Specially when you look for your expectations to be materialized by someone outside you, it is fine if you have expectations from you yourself until you are not punishing yourself if it doesn\u2019t happen as you wanted, you need to be wise and understanding enough if things doesn\u2019t shape up as you wanted it to be, because entire outcome is not all your making when you are delegating your duties in this world.\n\nYou need to be happy for performing your deeds with all your heart and if you do it with an intention to serve, you have done your best, rest has to be left in the hands of the creator & the given context to be decided. When you live this way your perception to see the things becomes more realistic, you no more live under the cloud cover of ego, you free yourself from the blame game and all your actions reflect your true commitment.\n\nUntil your action is not done with an intent to serve others unconditionally, you can\u2019t be committed in a true sense. The moment you expect any outcome that very act becomes impure and leads to conflict of interest. Is it realistic to act selflessly? Yes, it may sound difficult and not possible for normal humans, but for the truly enlightened being who cares only about the act and is liberated from the bonding of its outcome, it\u2019s possible, as their whole intent is to serve than to be served.\n\nIt is their commitment to perform their act with a purpose which is beyond their own existence, they know no limitations and are more like a child at heart, who extracts pleasure merely by taking action with utter curiosity to learn. They are not at all concerned about what will their actions lead to.\n\nIt is normal to go wrong, but it is abnormal to dwell upon it, it is perfectly fine if you fail in your deed and it is great if you can develop this understanding that giving your best shot was all your making, it is easier said than done, but to be a truly successful and most importantly to be a great human being you need to accept you as you are, to act what you feel right, to be what you want to be and augment this all with a purpose to serve without expecting to be served. When you surrender and act your heart out, you become a realized being who is truly enlightened and fulfilled from within."

The output doesn\u2019t reflect the amount of hard work she puts into getting it done. To be true, she is not effective and efficient in her approach and very often ends up being unproductive. What is wrong with her effort? Why she ends messing up everything?\n\nI have observed and deeply experienced that any task small or big, easy or complex demands certain level of passion, love & commitment. That extra care, that romanticism with your work has to exist to help it reach to its ultimate desired state.\n\nHave you experienced whenever you are doing something which put\u2019s you into a kind of flow you hardly realize the time which passed by, it\u2019s a state of deep engagement where you are kind of lost and feel ecstatic, I call it a state of Meditation where you miss most of unproductive things, that sound of distraction no more exists and someone has to wake you up to bring you back into the state of normalcy. Yes, it may be a crazy state to be in, but it works wonders & you can only attain that state of absolute flow only & only when you are in absolute love with your task, your professions.\n\nYou may like : It Is Good To Startup But It Is Wise To See If You Can Pull It Through ?\n\nSo if you are looking to excel in your workplace and want to be effectively productive in your deeds you have to fall in unconditional love with your work. So it is highly advisable that you choose your profession right, else you will end up wasting your life for something which is against your own will and will force you to make unwanted adjustments and compromises.\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

        "text": "This brilliant innovation has powered many blockchain system like bitcoin, litecoin, NEO, Ripple and many more digital currency. Today we will cover in detail about Ethreuem : A Comprehensive Blockhain Ecosystem which is empowering many blokchain powered innovative idea to capture the imagination of ingenious minds and the world as a whole.\n\nA group of people known by pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato gave this world a truly game changing technology, which now the world knows by the name The Blockchain : A chain of decentralized public ledger or database blocks.\n\nYoung ingenious fellow Vitalik Buterin proposed in 2013 that a single blockchain with the capability to be reprogrammed to perform any arbitrarily complex computation could subsume these many other eventually in 2014 he together with his partners began to work, with a vision to implement a general, fully trustless smart contract platform which you now know as Ethereum, The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins \u201cpremined\u201d for the crowdsale.\n\nAs per wiki: In 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains \u2014 the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017.\n\nEVM is at the heart of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized platform which can execute code of arbitrary algorithmic complexity. In computer science terminology, It is Called Turing complete. Techies can develop their own Dapp\u2019s that gets executed on the Ethereum\u2019s EVM using the language like JS, Python etc. Developers can create applications that run on the EVM using friendly programming languages modelled on existing languages like JavaScript and Python.\n\nSimilar to other blockhain ethereum works on P2P Network Protocols where each blockchain database is maintained and managed by multiple nodes each connected to the P2P network. Each node running their own EVM executes the same instructions, That\u2019s why Ethereum is sometimes described evocatively as a \u201cworld computer\u201d.\n\nThe ethereum nodes runs the EVM to build a decentralized consensus across the Blockchain network making Ethereum Network\n\nEthereum has its own cryptocurrency named Ether which they also call as\n\nIf any client executes any transaction on ethereum P2P network he pays in the form Ether to fuel the trasaction. Ether is also an incentive for encouraging developer to write a high quality dapp\u2019s to minimize the cost which goes into writing a crappy code, it inspires the developers to maintain the coding standards apt for building a healthy ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEther went into a presale offer where(data sourced from: https://www.ethereum.org/ether )\n\nAs per agreement by the platform stakeholders the max supply of ether has been restricted to : 18 million ether per year (this number equals 25% of the initial supply). This means that while the absolute issuance is fixed, the relative inflation is decreased every year. The rate is going to change in 2018\u201319, as the new platform is under development named Casper where ethereum is expected to change from proof of work. Casper is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy.\n\nEthereum while handling any transaction make use of the basic unit called \u201cAccounts\u201d. The state of each account in a blockchain is maintained together with the state, of amount being transferred and information of the accounts involved in transaction.\n\nUser who wants to transact over ethereum\u2019s network has to pay a small transaction fee, this has been done deliberately to maintain the platform decorum and protect it from frivolous or malicious computational tasks, like DDoS attacks or infinite loops. The sender of a transaction must pay for each step of the task they initiated, including computation and memory storage. These fees are paid in amounts of Ethereum\u2019s native value-token, ether.\n\nThe transaction fees are collected by network nodes which act as miners in the Ethereum Network.These miners receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions. The miners then group the transactions \u2014 which include many updates to the \u201cstate\u201d of accounts in the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 into what are called \u201cblocks\u201d, and miners then compete with one another for their block to be the next one to be added to the blockchain.\n\nYou must be thinking what is the reward for Miners to verify and validate the account owners, well they get Ethers for every successful mining of blocks which kind of, is an incentive for miners to invest their resources to power the Ethereums huge electricity needs.\n\nLike Bitcoin network here also miners performs complex mathematical problems to be solved where they parse through all the chain of blocks to verify them as a Proof Of Work, Any computational problem that requires orders of magnitude more resources to solve algorithmically than it takes to verify the solution is a good candidate for proof of work. Once the block is verified it gets added into the Ethreum\u2019s blockchain network."

        "text": "Don\u2019t Seek Happiness You Were Born To Be Happy And To Express All Kinds Of Emotions!\n\nAre you not happy for what you are ? Are you not happy to be alive and reading this article of mine at this very moment ? Are you worried and stressed for not having it all? Are you feeling miserable for not having a meaningful life ? If yes, I am sorry you are not alive and not fully aware about you yourself. If you would have spent considerable time understanding this life you are bestowed with, you would be dancing with bliss and happy in all circumstances. To be happy you just need to do one thing and that is, to do the things you love doing and owning the same. To be human is to be happy being human and being grateful for that. Secret Of Being Happy: There Is Nothing Secret About It! If you really feel that this world is crude and not a great place to live, think again, you are fooling yourself and living ignorantly this amazing life. You are denying this very life itself and going about it very casually without paying enough attention to the situation. So to be true, there is no secret as such to be happy. You just need to enhance your perception to understand the given situation and accept that context as it is.\n\nWe very often try to put our logical mind to dissect the situation with our intellect and limited knowledge about this life which seldom has an answer, we engage in a blame game for all the bad things which happens instead of owning the responsibility of all what is not good. If we can be conscious enough and understanding enough to assess the situation we can laugh at will and be happy, no matter what happens. With enhanced consciousness and perception we can accept the bad\u2019s and good\u2019s without discriminating and judging. There is nothing to lose and only to gain and if we all can live like that, we can be happy in all circumstances Let The Child In You Be Alive : One of the main reasons we have lost this very birthright of being happy is that we have stopped being a child and living too much like an animated puppet trying to portray the image which suits to the need of the society and not to our own need. If we try to live the life this way we are knowingly giving the control of our emotions to somebody else and if that is the case we are bound to be miserable. So let the child be alive in you and act authentically. Our biggest mistake is that we act not the way we want, instead the way society or some third person wants us to act. Yes, It is wise to be understanding and concerned, but to act, has to be your will, not others and if your action goes against your way you should own it & be happy for the outcome. Understanding is the key, if you feel like crying, cry, if you feel like laughing, laugh, but never label the context as good or bad, accept it and move on, if you can learn this one art of living you will be doing fairly well in your life . 1. Don\u2019t Conclude or judge any people or situation as they are not your making and you can never have a control over it. 2. Don\u2019t try to be happy you were born with it and it comes naturally to you as a human being, \u201cSimply Be Happy \u201c For everything you have and you are 3. Increase your understanding of the situation and be wise enough to accept its reality. 4. Express yourself and don\u2019t hold your emotions as they are your true wealth which needs to be expressed."

        "text": "All About NEO Blockchain Ecosystem You Ever Wanted To Know !\n\nWith the advent of world\u2019s first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin a totally a new kind of smart digital economy is sweeping this world\u2019s market and has taken everyone by storm. Now many more Altcoins Altcoins are the alternative cryptocurrencies launched after the success of Bitcoin. They are more a kind of a better substitutes to Bitcoin which being a first P2P digital asset, has kind of laid down the way for others alternate coins to follow the path. Many altcoins are trying to target any perceived limitations that Bitcoin has and come up with newer versions with competitive advantages. Some of the popular examples of altcoin include Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, Zetacoin, Novacoin, etc. Litecoin is seen as the closest competitor to Bitcoin. And other alternative digital currency and the blockchain transaction platform has risen up, all to fuel our current digital economy to make it super efficient and smart. This current digital economy powered by Blockchain technology is going to transform the way we use to transact and in collaboration with IoT & AI, it will make this current generation and upcoming generation the most smartest generation ever. Today we will discuss more about NEO: An open network of smart economy also popularly known as the Ethereum of China. We will uncover this Popular Blockchain platform in the following phases What Is NEO After All ? NEO is the Blockchain powered platform to digitize assets using digital identity and it uses smart contract to self-manage digital assets, thereby providing a distributed network of all stakeholders to benefit from this smart economy comprising the power of: It was formerly called as Antshares and has evolved with recent iteration on existing Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts and by using a unique Blockchain algo that improves upon Ethereum\u2019s model. It is also known to close loopholes that have caused some Ether contracts to be vulnerable to hackers. As discussed above NEO has been created with a vision to shift our market from being a traditional economy to being a Smart economy using the power of decentralized blockchain mechanism. In order to materialize it NEO has conceptualized it in the following way. NEO wants to integrate digital assets, digital identity, and smart contracts into its platform. When the company rebranded themselves from Antshares and upgraded to NEO 2.0 it introduced new features, such as cross-chain protocol, quantum-resistant cryptography, a distributed storage protocol and a secure communication protocol. \u201cWe hope the platform can be used for different front end scenarios, such as the Digital asset wallet, Forum, Voting, Profile management and Mobile applications. The platform also features an open API that can be used for integration with other systems.\n\nNEO blockchain platform allows user to register, trade and transact multiple types of digital asset. So what are Digital Assets Actually ? Digital assets are programmable assets that exist in the form of electronic data. NEO blockchain platform enables users to create their profile, engage in trading and to manage multiple types of digital currency(assets). It helps in the decentralized digitization of their assets in highly secure & reliable environment, which is free from any third party intervention.Assets registered through a validated digital identity are protected by law. It is accessible & identifiable by all smart contracts and clients and can be recorded in the given system space These assets types are recorded in the private storage area of the smart contract and require a compatible client to recognize them. It has to match to certain pre-defined protocols and standards in order to achieve compatibility with most clients using it to transact. To maintain digital identity has become a must to have requirement in many social platforms & in many business related transactions. Our current tech and infrastructure to manage user identity is obsolete and is quite inefficient, error prone, insecure and expensive, resulting in bad customer experience. So it has become a critical for the businesses to have some reliable mechanism for identity management in the digital world. NEO\u2019s Digital identity feature refers to the identity information of individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in electronic form. It offers a secured mechanism to store, transact and authenticate the digital identity which is efficient and quick, it employs Public Key Infrastructure(PKI)X.509 digital identity standards. NEO\u2019s verification of identity when issuing or using digital identities includes the use of facial features, fingerprint, voice, SMS and other multi-factor authentication methods.NEO\u2019s Digital Identity mechanism replaces the OCSP(Online Certificate Status Protocol) with the Blockchain tech to make it a more trusted platform to maintain digital identity. Nick Szabo first introduced the world with Smart Contract in 1994 which, When a pre-programmed condition is triggered, the smart contract will execute the corresponding contract terms. It\u2019s a piece of software that has its own protocols for negotiating the contract terms, verifies the contract automatically and executes the agreed terms between two parties involved.\n\nThe NEO Smart Contract 2.0 includes the following features: certainty, high performance, and expandability. The contract types include: validation contracts, function contracts, and application contracts. This Smart Contracting feature of NEO is one of the prominent offerings by NEO\u2019s smart ecosystem for aspiring developers, they can program it in the language they know like c#, Java or other programming languages of their choice. NeoContract is supported in all familiar IDE\u2019s like Visual Studio, Eclipse etc for smart contract development, debugging and compilation. NeoVM a virtual machine is extremely reliable, scalable and highly concurrent to be employed by techie\u2019s around the globe in smart contract development. We will cover the tech part later in our next article NEO For Techies to showcase how you can harness NEO\u2019s Blockchain Platform for developing your own product idea. NEO \u2014 formerly known as Antshares (ANS). GAS \u2014 formerly known as Antcoins (ANC). NEO token is the investment token of NEO blockchain ecosystem. It has a total supply capping of 100 million token to be used in blockchain creation, decentralized network management, voting for bookkeeping, to manage network related changes and others consensus based requirements. These 100 million tokens were all pre-mined during the genesis block creation and represents the right to manage the network. The minimum unit of NEO is 1 and tokens cannot be subdivided. It is the fuel to empower the network resource control of NEO blockchain. GAS is divisible by a factor of 1/1\u2070\u2078, and it was not pre-mined. 100 million GAS tokens will ultimately be generated through a decay algorithm in about 22 years. The NEO network will set a threshold by voting to exempt GAS from a certain amount of transfer transactions and smart contract operations to enhance the user experience. When a large amount of spam transactions occurs, NeoID can be used to prioritize transactions and smart contracts with qualified identities. Transactions and smart contracts with no qualifying digital identities can get priority by paying GAS.\n\nDelegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) algorithm \u2014 This is a consensus mechanism (instead of the traditional proof of work/stake) that allows the system to resist the Byzantine Generals problem and maintains consensus even if some nodes bare malicious intentions NeoX \u2014 This system will create the ability to execute and operate across various Blockchains NEO Contract \u2014 Is the mechanism for creating smart contracts seamlessly in scalable, high performance environments that integrates pre-existing codebases (e.g. C#, VB.Net, F#, Java, Kotlin) NeoFS \u2014 This is a service which allows decentralized storage (like a peer to peer Dropbox) NeoQ \u2014 A lattice-based cryptographic mechanism which creates problems that cannot be solved by quantum computers and ensuring being quantum-proof As we discussed above that the hard cap of NEO token is 100 million. This number has been divide into two portions one portion has 50 million tokens to be distributed proportionally to all NEO crowd funders and the second one has remaining 50 million NEO tokens which is directly managed by NEO Council to support the NEO ecosystem development & growth keeping current and future in perspective.The NEO in this portion had a lockout period of 1 year and is now unlocked after October 16, 2017. This portion will not enter the exchanges and is only for long-term support of NEO projects. This distribution mechanism is listed on NEO offcial site as given below - 10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate NEO developers and members of the NEO Council - 10 million tokens (10% total) will be used to motivate developers in the NEO ecosystem - 15 million tokens (15% total) will be used to cross-invest in other block-chain projects, which are owned by the NEO Council and are used only for NEO projects - 15 million (15% total) will be retained as contingency - The annual use of NEO in principle shall not exceed 15 million tokens Initial amount of GAS token is zero and every time with a new block creation GAS is generated As per neo.org, the total limit of 100 million GAS will be achieved in about 22 years. The interval between each block is about 15\u201320 seconds, and 2 million blocks are generated in about one year. Each year around 2 million blocks will be generated and the initial generation will be 8 GAS per block. There will be an annual reduction of 1 GAS per block, per year, to coincide with the passing of every 2 million blocks. The reduction will continue down to just 1 GAS per block and will be held at that rate for around 22 years. After the 44 millionth block the total GAS generated will have reached 100 million and from this point there will be no further generation of GAS from new blocks. NEO platform aims to provide a rich and powerful system for visinories & aspiring techies to build their own unique Decentralized apps using NEO blockchain ecosystem and publish it for the masses and businesses. Being an open source community based project NEO encourages many tech enthusiasts to create their app and list on their platform as a solution. DApps means decentralized (i.e. D-Apps) applications, but every app can\u2019t be a Dapp to be called Dapp it has fulfill following given criteria like, It Should Be An Open Source \u2014 All the programming source code is publicly available It Should Be Decentralized \u2014 Uses a blockchain-like cryptographic technology. Has to Have Some Incentive \u2014 App has crypto-tokens/digital assets for fueling itself. Algorithm/Protocol \u2014 Generates tokens and has an inbuilt consensus mechanism. NEO powered ecosystem has listed on neo.org many use cases of its platform to fuel Decentralized app development which will cover many dimensions of current and upcoming technology driven market, across the globe making the economy a smart economy full of opportunities for all . On NEO platform you can find many such dapp\u2019s at ndapp\u2019s(Neo Dapp\u2019s) : http://ndapp.org/ Next in the series on NEO Blockchain Ecosystem we will uncover the technology behind NEO\u2019s powerful platform and how techies can exploit it to build apps which can be a game changer and which can empower this digital economy to reach new heights. NEO ecosystem with its own currency, smart contract and being an open source platform will play very crucial role in disrupting the digital world and its economy. Blockchain is a real innovation everyone who wants to build a tech of future must adopt and should start investing if not done yet. Identity management, digital transaction, secure authentication and many more such apps has already came into existence and many more innovative solution will popup as economy will become more favorable globally for such Decentralized apps. I have no doubt that it will happen across the globe with the time, yes challenges will be there but it all comes to foster this kind of new innovations, and no market can deny blockchain powered tech, if they want to be really growing and to remain consumer friendly in the coming future. Market punishes who are not quickly adapting and who are not open to new things which world has to to offer. On this positive note i would like to leave you all with this excellent compilation on Blockchain Project Ecosystem: by Josh Nussbaum"

        "title": "A Non-Techie Guide For Outsourcing Your Product Development To An IT Agency?",
        "text": "A Non-Techie Guide For Outsourcing Your Product Development To An IT Agency?\n\nThis is not a blueprint or a full proof plan, it is just a guide based on my life experiences, having worked as a techie, product manager, leader and now as a product consultant and strategist. I have coined this in most simplified manner, in simple language which everyone can understand with ease. This guide is for all who is looking to startup, who is looking to develop any software solution for their business idea or to enhance their customer outreach through mobile & web based solution.\n\nOne night while sitting on your work desk(Or in the Bathroom : A Favorite place for thinkers) one concept hits your intelligent mind. You started to think day & night about the same idea and could not help but to pour yourself fully to do the required research for its market viability, monetization model, competitive analysis if it exists and much more.\n\nYou started to do all the due diligence to document the first ever draft for yourself, you write everything down whatever you feel & researched on the piece of paper and go on to document the same in the word doc. Soon you realize that you need to make it actionable as the very idea is so fascinating for you and giving the sleepless night. So you decide to hire the expert agency who can help you out and after many rounds of interviews you finalize one who you feel fit\u2019s to your needs.\n\nThen why it happens that most of the first timer have bad experiences while getting their idea executed by the experts whom they finalized after thorough due diligence. Is there something wrong with the agency? Or you dreamers are yourself wrong. Is the entire approach is wrong ? Why it happens that things somehow gets started but never completes the journey as per your expectations. Let me help you out with some basic fundamentals which I feel when practiced can help you minimize this error. I don\u2019t think anyone here is responsible single-handedly, but the very approach of getting things kick-started and getting it done is mostly the main reason for the project execution disasters.\n\nProject Owner more often than not are under prepared and do not have the exact requirement documentation in place, it is recommended that they hire some consultant if they are not well equipped to prepare the detail requirement doc. If the Scope of work and functional document is pre prepared on the owner\u2019s side the execution plan can be well defined and cost can be minimized.\n\nYes owner not being the expert is not expected to know it all, but knowing this it also important for them to know who can help him out for the same. Saving cost at this level is not worthy, to save the cost of hiring a consultant, many times clients think they will document it all or ask someone to do it for free, this all never pays back in the long run and when this realization happens it is already too late on the project owner\u2019s part.\n\nThe second most crucial aspect for project success is to plan a budget based on all possible expenses involved. But not being the expert project owner misses many important to include in the budget planning. It is highly recommended that they consider :\n\nBefore Kick-starting the development one needs to hire an expert consultant and get all the BRS, SRS, Functional Doc, Design Doc in place, so that when they approach any agency for development they are well prepared not under prepared. So owners should always allocate a budget for the same.\n\nNow with the project requirement doc in place, the owner can then hire the agency, by signing a mutual NDA, asking them to send their RFP(Request for proposal) which will help the owner to finalize the development expenses, where they should work with the agency to come down to the project expense of first MVP. It also becomes really important here that project execution budget is broken down into milestones, because planning the entire budget in one go is literally impossible, so if the owner and the agency can sit and break down the same with mutual consent it will allow the management of the finance quite easy.\n\nMost of the project owner often ignores the costing of Quality analysis and testing of the project. They don\u2019t hire these resources and expect the developer to do the primary testing and on the contrary they think they will manage themselves. But it is recommended here that a separate QA professionals should be hired who will properly find and write all the possible test cases keeping a neutral view on the project.\n\nIt can be a part of the development agency, a different agency or a pool of tech geeks who loves to try and review the apps. But the expense of the same has to be considered while the project is under execution . This QA/QT team will also be required post-launch of the project. To keep the track of the real time user feedback and bugs which needs to be documented and shared with the development team to be fixed.\n\nVery often the project owners expect the developer to keep fixing the bugs even after the project has been implemented and launched into the market for real user to test and use. Where the contract has been signed off for the first phase. The main catch arises here. Just because there has no been no proper agreement on this part for how long developer are responsible to do it for free of cost, project suffers.\n\nIt is important that this scenario has to be well discussed and agreed upon and a budget for this scenario has to be mutually agreed upon. As now the real user gets involved and the need to fix the reported bugs in real time and little patch work here and there is expected this effort though will take small turnaround time, then when the project was under development has to be considered in cost estimation. This can also be considered under project maintenance expenses to some extent if not fully.\n\nNow that project is in the hands of real users as an owner, you may feel it is a time that you move on and plan your own tech team to further handle the development of the same. So if this is the planning you need to make sure that\n\nThis all incurs a certain cost which should be considered separately so that there is no misunderstanding when the final project is being signed off. This aspect is very often ignored while planning the project development cost at the initial stage of project planning. But it can lead to lots of chaos for both developer agency and project owners if neglected at the outset.\n\nAs an owner, you want to continue with the same agency after the first project MVP has been launched, it is always recommended to take this option until and unless you have got the funding where you can afford to build a new tech team from scratch to take care of the project from here(Also, if you have got the funds in hand why not negotiate and partner with the same agency to make them you dedicated tech partner and work in a collaborative manner, well you can work out this equation after considering your investor opinion and the agency opinion. If everyone can come on the same page it can be a win-win situation for all the stakeholders).\n\nIf you have this planning from the very outset of this project you should consider these expenses with mutual agreement in place for the same. At the same time be flexible as the cost is time dependent and context dependent. So if you keep the window open for discussion at the time of MVP launch you can better plan the budget for the same.\n\nProject maintenance is a matter of being flexible deliberate. If you can maintain a plan even as it must shift and evolve, and you will be ready to succeed.\n\nSo to keep your software faulty free and flexible to accommodate the new changes you need to have long term contract in place if you are working with development agency. Or as I suggested above, you can partner with them for dedicated tech development & support, in either case it has to be done with a long term perspective. Any short term planning will lead to the project failures sooner or later.\n\nIn a nutshell, under-pricing the project cost is lethal both for the project owner and the service providers, instead if we can be flexible enough to price it based on the current milestone and the given context you can break down the cost to chunks and keep fuelling the project so that it can run in the right shape and on the right track,in right pace.\n\nBe realistic to foresee the requirement and give the planning a chance to sustain, sit and discuss in small phases, plan the development life-cycle being flexible and allow the project to flower in the intended manner. Software development is similar to living plants, to keep it growing, you need to keep it nurtured with the right kind of water & sunlight, but before that you have to choose a right kind of soil to help it thrive, else it will rotten and die to rise up again.\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

        "title": "Top 3 Tech Trends: The State Of AR/VR, Blockchain & Crypto\u2019s in 2018",
        "text": "Top 3 Tech Trends: The State Of AR/VR, Blockchain & Crypto\u2019s in 2018\n\nWe humans know no limit, especially when it comes to technology. We are constantly striving to sharpen and improve upon the existing tech tools and looking for new ways to make our life even more comfortable than before. We have already seen how smartphone has impacted our day to day living & Cut down smartphone device from your life for one day, it may be like court has given you a lifetime imprisonment, isn\u2019t it? That is a kind of dependency we have developed with this tech revolution of the century. 2017 has seen the price war in a smartphone world, which was complemented with data price war between various data service providers, especially in India. Apple released its \u00a3999 iPhone X to celebrate its ten-year anniversary and Samsung unveiling its successor to the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 which struggled to get enough user attention. The battle for supremacy in smartphone industry will continue into this year too and will see some aggressive pricing and marketing strategy being deployed by giants like Samsung, MI, 1+5, Motorola, Google, Nokia and many more new player will try to find its space in this already crowded market. New Tech Trends To Watch Out For In 2018- The new year is also expected to bring some innovative tech advancements beyond this smartphone industry. 2018 Will Be More About : AR, VR, AI, & Crypto 1. AR & VR: Is The New Reality- AR (mobile AR, smart glasses) could approach three and a half billion installed base and $85 billion to $90 billion revenue within 5 years. At the same time, VR (mobile, standalone, console, PC) might deliver 50 to 60 million installed base and $10 billion to $15 billion. That\u2019s a pretty big difference, and it all has to do with AR\u2019s ubiquity and VR\u2019s focus. (Note: AR/VR adviser [reports/tools, company network, strategy consulting, investment banking] Digi-Capital\u2019s new Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2018 base case is that even with 900 million installed base for ARKit/ARCore by the end of this year, AR/VR revenue will only start to scale in 2019) AR /VR Revenue Prediction for You: Brought To You By Digi-Capital\n\nBlockchain can make healthcare sector more intelligent & smarter. Rather, it will be an evolutionary journey for blockchain-based healthcare systems or applications where trust & security based mechanism will play a major role in its implementation. See below some of the use cases for the same. We have seen 2017 to be the year where many forks of Bitcoin were found like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver, Diamond etc\u2026 and we can expect many such forks for others digital cryptos in coming future seeing the success of Bitcoin Cash. IFO: Intial Fork Offerings will become a popular thing on 2018. ICO: Many Intial Coin Offerings platform will come into development garnering enough investor & traders community interest into it. So what exactly is ICO - As per investopedia:- It is an unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is used by startups to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies but usually for Bitcoin. This trend will be augmented by the existing ICO platform like CoinList & Balanc3. these platforms are already helping many companies and their investors, raise fund for themselves. So ICO is all set to become a norm in market like IPO has become for public limited companies. Likewise there will be many more opportunities which will come across in various industrial sectors where crypto\u2019s, blockchain, smart contracting will become quite popular in transacting digital information where security will play a major game changing role. I some how have the feeling: That no matter what, blockchain is going to stay and will change the whole paradigm of digital data transactions. It will give rise to a totally new world like internet revolution did, where everyone will be enjoying the effective, efficient and secured transaction of the digital information which will be purely based on a strong foundation of trust. The World has come a long way from exchanging goods through barter system, to using legal tender (country wise legalised currency ) and now it is witnessing a totally new way of transacting between two human beings or agencies(parties ) in the form of cryptocurrencies. This journey from barter to Bitcoin is no coincidence, it is a phenomenon which we humans the most sophisticated gadget on this earth has given birth to. This phenomenon will impact all the existing sectors to such an extent that if they don\u2019t adopt this blockchain innovation swiftly they will be outdated and will be punished by the market. -So yes it is a time that we all stop living in speculation and start taking actions to be blockchain ready, else all we will be left with will be, a mere prediction. -Market has always been supportive to those who are willing enough to catch the trend way before their competitors and who takes action by learning from the past, acting in current dynamics and investing in future trends.

What do you want to be? I have never found anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be super successful.\n\nThen why it\u2019s the case that very few of those dreamers make it big & becomes entitled to be a super successful human?. Are you also seeking the answer for the same, I guess if you are still with me, you do have this question drumming your mind. So today we will together uncover, what one shouldn\u2019t do if one really wants to be successful in their endeavors.\n\nBefore we uncover this success mantra, let us define success\n\nThere can be 1000 different ways & experience of you and all the great achievers to define success. It can inspire you, but what matters the most is What actions you are taking to see yourself on that elite list? How are you going about that action? Do you have the courage to follow your heart and listen to your intuition, these all questions is what should matter to you and compel you to sow the right seed, and nurture it with the right kind of actions, to be what you want to be.\n\nWhat you should not do is equally important to what you should do in-order to be successful in your life. Here I would share my personal experiences, observation and learnings, to put forth my idea of success.\n\nIt is The Most Valuable Asset To Help You Get What You Want. The biggest threat to any one who wants to be successful is, the poor time management. It leads to a leakage of time in the activities which is nothing more than a total time waste. We always desire a lot, but seldom act, rather we wait for the things to become congenial and postpone to act upon it. We can\u2019t let Time to slip away from our hands, if we really care for our well being and want to see ourselves succeeding, it is a must that we know how to put time available to us in doing things which matters to us. Every minute of our life counts, so we need to take charge of it and engage in the activities which can lead us to our desired goals.\n\nTo be a successful human you must first understand this with absolute clarity that,\n\nAccept Your limitation and manifest your strength to its true potential, don\u2019t try, to live the life of others and to act as other wants you to, turn inward and ask as many questions as possible and find solutions for your problems. To succeed it is mandatory that you own your life and control it, to let it function the way you want.\n\nIf you are a leader of your troop, you may be lured to take credit for whatever success you achieve while you are delegating your duties, but do remember this and make it your life\u2019s mantra-\n\n\u201cYou are as successful as your team \u201d\n\nSo never ever utter this poisonous word\n\nPeople who master this art of sharing their success with others are the ones who are happy and successful in the true sense.\n\nI have experienced and have realized in my journey as a father, brother, husband, son and as a Co-Founder of My startup, that-\n\nIf you can live your life with pure honesty and unwavering trust you can succeed in all walks of life and most importantly you can truly relish this life being human."

With little encouragement & support from his own loved ones, Rene was losing all the hope to materialize his dream, one day he decided to join a basketball coaching club, nearby to his residence where his father worked as a Physio of the club team.\n\nHis head coach on the very first day of his training asked him a million dollar question?\n\nRene responded, right from the childhood, he always had only one dream, to see himself playing along with the leading basketball champs. But nobody around me thought that I can do it, not even my parents, just because my height was not what was required to be a good basketball player. On the contrary, I never thought like that, I always felt from deep within that i have all the courage and desire to overcome my own limitation and to harness my abilities, to be among the leading players. So I always chanted on Mantra,\n\nSir, I need to support my passion, my dream and if height is the problem I will do whatever is required to overcome it. So I am standing right in front of you and promising you today that I will work hard to sharpen my skills, will practice every day without failing and will be the most celebrated basketball player of this world, one day with your support.\n\nRene after 3 years of relentless practice and with consistent daily routine has made it to the national basketball team and is rubbing shoulders with the best of the best. Yes, he may not be the tallest like others, but the height factor never posed any challenges for him to succeed at this top level. Now he is one of the most respected and consistent player for his national side and is about to represent his country in the upcoming NBA Championship\n\nSo what is the whole point of Rene\u2019s inspiring story, my message is pretty clear, there are no such obstacles for any human being to achieve what s/he intent to be, One should never give a damn to anybody\u2019s comment where they say\n\nInstead, If you can invest yourself in your real life dreams and have sufficient guts to learn the art and master it with an inch by inch improvement every day, you can be there where you want to be. We humans have been gifted to dream against all odds and make it true using our intellect and tools given to us by almighty.\n\nYou just need to reject this very notion that life is difficult, instead make sure you are always talking to yourself and learning whatever you have been bestowed by this life full of possibility. You need to change the perception of yours and not act as per others thought process. Imagine this current digital age, in which you are living, don\u2019t you feel blessed to have all the tools and technologies to help you reach your desired goals much quicker than your past generations. Until you have figured out what you really want from your life you will find it difficult to navigate this life, but if you have figured it out you can work every day to materialize the same through,\n\nSo next time someone says that you can\u2019t do it, take it as a challenge, but don\u2019t change your passions, don\u2019t change your dream. Simply ignore those crappy advices and move on with whatever you have decided for yourself, be ready for the failures and grow out of it with the attitude that helps to learn.\n\nLive life as per your perceptions and don\u2019t give a damn to the outcome, your strongest enemy is you yourself, when you give your life\u2019s charge to someone else you become a slave and will never be able to grow.\n\nNever ever do this to yourself, be accountable for your actions and fully own it, never stop trying and listen to your inner calling, take opinions from who have done it in the past, but have your own perceptions & make your choices well based on your understanding of life and learnings."

Great Job ! But hold on! Have you took the precautions to ensure you don\u2019t loose your private key which ensures you never loose your digital currency purchased. Yes most of the exchanges has took security mechanism like secured user authentication and PIN etc.. which you can use to access your purchased coin, if you have done your transaction using their own mobile wallet, you would have experienced the same. But still you need to take more concrete measures, so that you never lose your hard earned money.\n\nBitcoin transactions claims to be secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf, but you need to take some key measure as a responsible investor, to safeguard your valuable asset from any possible frauds or hack\n\nOne of the most trusted and secure mechanism to store your digital assets are using the offline Wallets.They are also called alternatively as Cold Storage Wallets and is one of the most trusted mechanism with highest level of security for savings.\n\nHere is how it works ?\n\nIt can be done in the following 2 ways-\n\nIt is recommended that you use two different computers one of which will be internet connected having the watching wallet for creating unsigned transactions, another one will be working offline which will actually hold the entire wallet and the digital asset stored in it. It will be used for all signed transactions. with this approach you can\n\nWith this mechanism one cannot withdraw any saved assets as the computer which is connected to the network cannot sign transactions and mitigates any chance of fraud transactions\n\nArmory in one such tool that can be used to do offline transaction signature.\n\nThese wallets has been found to be the most secured mechanism to store your bitcoin and also gives you the ease to transact.

        "text": "Be A Seeker To Know Thyself ?\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the philosopher Socrates famously declared that the unexamined life was not worth living. Asked to sum up what all philosophical commandments could be reduced to, he replied: \u2018Know yourself.\u2019\n\nNow It\u2019s a time that we truly work on ourselves 10 times, 1oo times or whatever time is required to find what is that we love doing? What is that which matters a lot than anything else? What is that which you can keep doing tirelessly without grumbling? It\u2019s a time in this very moment that we do rigorous self inquiry, if not done yet and know ourselves inside-out. If we fail to do this I am afraid, we will be wasting a great gift of \u201c LIFE \u201c to be born as a Human Being.\n\nYes, I know this question must be coming in your mind how god damn can I know what I am good at? The answer sometimes seems way too difficult for most of us, But have we realized why we find it hard to address our own quest of knowing what we are best at, well, I feel there is always an answer to any question of yours, it is just we don\u2019t ask enough questions.\n\nIs it that difficult to question, no, not at all, In fact we grew up doing so right from the age where humans learned to generate fire out of stones, to this digital age, right from being a curious kid to so called knowledgeable grown up, Everything came into existence out of our curiosity to know. It has been our sheer ability to question a lot, which has helped us discover, innovate and create the world we are living. It has been our quest to take up the challenge head-on which has led to many revolutionary technology to take birth. So no, it is not at all difficult, it is just that, we are ignorant to our own innate ability. We are not questioning enough to find and looking for some kind of miracle to happen, to change our life, it is really a irresponsible way of living.\n\nI feel the best tool to know thyself, is to do self-inquiry and complement it with the questions directed to self. Your journey to know yourself should start with you, yourself first, you can\u2019t find answers to your questions from anything or anybody outside you. External things exists only to help you enhance you experience of life it has nothing to do with your bliss & fulfillment.\n\nWhen you become a seeker, you start questioning and on the way to your quest you figure out the answers which you always wanted to know. You know the reality you know the truth."

        "text": "How The Curiosity Converted To An App Idea & What I Learned From It?\n\nIt was sept 2017 I was traveling back from Delhi to Indore from a business trip, I needed to update my social profile specially LinkedIn. So started browsing some of my pics from the phone gallery. I was kind of confused, I was not able to decide which pic will look best as my profile pic. This curiosity of mine kind of pushed me to wonder what if someone can help me out in deciding the same? What if I can get a polling on the same where I get to know the public opinion on the same, like we do in a realtime voting to select our favorite politician or to understand what public opinion is post electoral voting?.\n\nI wondered why can\u2019t I get my fellow friends, countryman and people from across the globe to help me decide which of my two pics looks better. After all Facebook has been the kind of social platform currently being used to share the pic and see who all liked the pic, but it can\u2019t help you get the real time public voting to help you decide ?\n\nIt was that small curiosity which compelled me to write down an app idea. Being a technology entrepreneur and also as a mobilepreneur, I had the leverage to convert any small idea into an app, I did the same to address my curiosity, I sat with my tech team and drafted a small product blueprint, explained the same to the team, conceptualized the idea and connected it with a virtual point system where if one wants to get an answer to following question-\n\nEtc Etc\u2026 whatever you can imagine possible?\n\nThey have to spend these virtual point to upload two pics to get voted or build opinion poll.\n\nOur team came up with this idea that let us allow user to find how many votes they got and also see the detailed analytics of the same which helps them to understand from which part of the country votes are coming, which age group is voting for you and most importantly what is their gender. But we also ensured that it is totally anonymous as it happens in an opinion poll. This analytics has to be unlocked using the virtual points. So if one wants to get an opinion poll on their photos and to view the analytics for the same they have to spend the virtual points, which they need to earn by\n\nSo intent here is to allow user to vote others to help them decide which pic stand out and give them the required gratification by solving their dilemma of choosing their best pic, which I personally experienced and decide to gift a solution to masses.\n\nSo here is WhatAPic App which covered his journey from an idea to a real product and now helping out few more curious minds like me to get the real time votes and helping them to put their best pic forward.\n\nDo You Want This App, Click the link Below and go to the google play store to download it :-\n\nStart voting and get voted, for helping your fellow being to solve their frequent question \u201cwhich One?\u201d (Kaun Sa Bhai ?)\n\nDon\u2019t suppress your wandering mind, it often has a solution for most of your day to day problems and wishes, listen to it and get surprised. You need to be curious about everything, then only you can create some wonderful solution for yourself and for the masses and yes you can end up earning a lot of money also. Having said that, you also need to be gratified that at least you managed to answer your curiosity, irrespective of whether you made any money out of it or not.\n\nAllow me to compliment my curiosity with a beautiful thought of Steve Jobs, to end my little piece of a true story-\n\nEnding with a sense of gratitude towards all you awesome readers who are my true source of inspiration and compels me to act & write\u2026\n\nAnd, Do Not Forget To Clap\u2026."

        "text": "According to The Bhagavad Gita:\n\n(The Bhagavad Gita often referred to as simply the Gita, is a 700 verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata where Lord Krishna enlightens Arjuna With His Wisdom ).\n\nThere are three kinds of attributes which human beings are found to possess and portrays in their day to day living. These attributes are responsible to propel & shape all kinds of human actions, behavior & emotions.\n\nThe Sattvik Guna which orients humans to lead a life full of joy & happiness. People with this attribute are always in a state of bliss and lives life to it\u2019s fullest. These trait is often found in a wise person, who values their life and act to ensure they are reflecting the same in their surroundings.\n\nThis Rajasik characteristic is responsible for humans to attach themselves to the actions which can amass luxury to, fulfill their ever-growing demands & desires. This kind of people always gets gratifications from the outcome of their deeds and extracts happiness out of it. It\u2019s an attribute which lead to actions.\n\nThis Tamsik trait overclouds wisdom & impels one to sloth and live in ignorance. These kind of people are often lazy and live in arrogance.People with this nature are always self-centered and gives too much importance to \u201cI\u201d. They feel everyone around is a fool and they are the only one who act right. They lack empathy and wisdom to embrace the people around and often live their life in ignorance.\n\nThe Whole essence of the given Gita Sloka is that if you need to fully enjoy your life and act wisely, you can\u2019t live in ignorance, you have to be inclusive, you have to empathize, you have to be a team player, you have to be a human who relishes the act more and ignore the outcome. If you are too much self centered and possessive of accumulated stuff, you will often be miserable in your actions. To truly enjoy your work you need to simply go about it with all your heart out without feeling lost to what your actions can lead to . You can act with some kind of pre-assumption based on your accumulated knowledge but what will happen in the very next moment is not your doing, your only doing is to act with supreme efficiency and leave the best for the context to answer.\n\nSo it is better that we accept the reality as it is without keeping ourselves under any kind of ignorance of knowing it all.\n\nEnding with a sense of gratitude towards all your awesome readers who are my true source of inspiration and compels me to act & write\u2026\n\nWill continue this series of Bhagvad Geeta Lessons in the upcoming series\u2026\n\nTill Then Have Fun & Be A Wise Leaders, Father, Mother, Son,Daughter & Most Importantly A Good Human Being."

        "title": "5 Learning Hacks To Learn Things Faster ? \u2013",
        "text": "Being humans your act of highest order should be to learn and make what you have learned actionable In Every phase of your life you need to upgrade yourself to keep progressing and that can only be possible, if you set some goals either long term or short term, to achieve and put necessary learning endeavors to support that. If you are looking to learn, a new language, a new coding skills, a music or any professional course for that matter, you need to fine tune your body, your time management, your approach so that it becomes favorable for you to persist through the phase of learning without giving up at the dipping point. Though there is no full proof technique which can guarantee you quick learning as there are multiple factors to be considered, but still if you can follow this 5 basic principles you may be able to perform better in mastering the art of learning new things in quicker time duration. 5 Hacks To Help You Learn Better & Quicker?\n\nThe Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Suppose you are planning to learn playing guitar, which requires one to master 1. Strumming 2. Hammer On 3. Pull-Off etc.. Complex things, your first approach should be to learn the chords first and spending 80% of your time mastering the chords & transition between them that will help you learn quickly & will produce better results. This approach also works well when you are trying to learn any new coding language or anything for that matter. If you can break down the bigger goals to smaller milestones and spend most of your time mastering those small milestones you will be able to learn the skill in quicker time as 80% of the desired results are achieved by 20% of input we put efficiently. In order to master the skills you want to learn, one thing which will be very critical is that you are doing it with absolute razor sharp focus. Minimal distracted state is what will be required. Yes in this age of mobility it is harder said than done, but you can manage it, if you follow, What we call a Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. It means that you cut down all the possible distraction for a shorter period of time(25 min) and give your full attention to researching & practicing the task, this short burst of absolute focus will help you learn better. It is also recommended that you take short breaks(0f 5 min) in between to allow your brain to consume what has been fed. If you can attune yourself to practice this technique with supreme consistency you will see that you are learning faster & remembering it better. 3. Learn By Doing More Than Reading More(or being wannabe) I have personally experienced and observed that very often we spend too much time in browsing tutorial, watching videos, making notes and many times overdo these stuffs. The best approach is to pick one small tutorial , take one section of it and start getting our hands dirty by coding the stuffs. When I started writing I used to make a lot of mistakes(still it happens, but it has been minimized by writing more\u2026) but that i managed to overcome (by doing more means) writing more. If you want to do things, stop wanting, start doing it practically because 90% of our learning happens only when we start doing it. It is better to get your hands dirty and make mistakes as it will help you learn faster.\n\n4. Be Consistent: It Is Very Important That You Are Persistent With, What You Are Doing? Doing is your best tool to learn, but you have to ensure that you are doing it with sheer consistency, learn in small stretches, but do it every day without failing. Being consistent leads to great results, 100% of the time. One of the reasons why many give up learning new things in between is that they fail to be consistent in their approach."

        "title": "How Great Leaders Directs Attention To What Matters The Most?",
        "text": "How Great Leaders Directs Attention To What Matters The Most?\n\nIn an organization it is often observed that meetings go too long just because of the endless, meandering presentations which hardly produce any effective results. They very often lack the sense of focused thinking and miss what matters the most.\n\nDaniel Goleman in his book \u201cFocus\u201dmentions about Steve Balmer(The former CEO of Microsoft) where Steve always insisted people in a meeting, not to come with any presentation (strange right the very creator of Microsoft ppt finds it unproductive. ) He asks his team to send the presentation, before the meeting and straight away gets to q&a session to keep the affair well focussed.\n\nLet\u2019s decode the trait of great leaders who values time & insist on being focussed:\n\nAll the top notch leaders have this innate ability to gaze what matters the most and manage to shift the attention of their troop where it is needed the most. They are absolutely clear about What Not To Do? In the given context.\n\nI have personally experienced that many times we get into a trap of saying yes to everything, which totally throw us into a painful chaotic situation, but in that testing moment your ability to declutter yourself, helps you to focus on what is right in the given situations. Saying No always work wonders if you master it, yes, it is the most difficult art, but it will separate you from others to keep yourself moving forward.\n\nPeople gifted with the ability to direct their attention are extremely smart to seize the right moment and right opportunity whenever it comes their way. What makes them great in doing so, is their ability to focus inward, to manage others by focusing on what works right for them, also they are capable to handle the external situation by focusing outward.\n\nLets get into the details :\n\nIt requires one to have a higher sense of self-awareness & a greater control over their own emotions. This aspect of the leadership calls them to be emotionally intelligent. They sense the message which comes from their inner calling, they address their feeling which pops up from their gut, which very often signals what is right or wrong?\n\nSo turning your focus inward increases your level of Self-awareness and with this ability you always enables you to focus on what is right or wrong in any complex situations. They back their intuition to get answers very often.\n\nAlso, people who work on developing their inward focus are the one\u2019s who have a greater control on their own emotions. They have strong self-control over the given situations. They can stay calm and focussed no matter how testing the environment is, they understand the value of not loosing temper and have the strong ability to not let their emotions arouse out of anger. This trait help leaders, to lead their team towards the right direction and with greater clarity. They have this cognitive control remain ice-cool in the moment of crisis. They manage their own agitation and often bounce back quickly from setbacks to lead confidently.\n\nLeaders of some substance have this effective trait to understand what is going on with their team members, they sense their feelings and tweak their leadership style to make sure they are able to cater to their needs. With their strong ability to empathize and develop social relationships with people helps them to focus on what is required to drive their team in a right way to attain the desired goal.\n\n\u201cFocusing on others, is the foundation of empathy and of an ability to build social relationships \u2014 the second and third pillars of emotional intelligence \u201d.\n\nSo to focus on others requires you to master the art of empathy, Daniel defines this trait into three kinds, which he calls The Empathy Triad, Let get into some details of it,\n\nAccording to Daniel, effective leaders with this emotional intelligence exhibits three types of empathy\n\nWe will get into its detail later on, in our next article as it requires more elaboration.\n\nPeople who are strong on focusing others need are very strong in social skills, they understand the fact that if they have to drive their troop in some direction they need to first build a right kind of rapport & strong relationship with them, so that they can make the required emotional connect to inspire them and lead them with utter clarity. They understand the value inclusiveness and inculcate that into their approach of going about their task.\n\nLeaders with this ability to focus their attention on the outer world with a clear cut strategy of what they expect from the external world are a real visionary. They have this gifted ability to sense the possible outcome for their actions which helps them to cut down the possible chaos and helps them to make choices which can mitigate the possible debacles in the future.\n\nThey are a smart picker who loves to digest the important data and filter out which is a garbage and base their present & future decisions based on that. They are open to new things and love surprises which can help them learn and be future ready.\n\nLeaders know the fact that to create anything new or to innovate, they need to sustain the outward focus, so they work cutting all what is irrelevant and distracting, they spend some quality time, reflect on all possibilities, this focussed time leads to innovation.\n\nTo be a true focussed leader one needs to be in full control of their own attention. They introspect, they address their inner calling, they control their impulses, they are fully conscious of what\u2019s happening around and also aware of how others perceive them, they put their filters on to weed out irrelevant things, they empathize with others, they allow their minds to wander to come up with new ways of innovating. They are full package which can control both inward situations and external situations to focus on the things of prime importance and most importantly, they value their time and utilizes the power of saying No to their full advantage.\n\nI have never personally experienced my life to be bad, I have always seen it as a great opportunity to do things which I can focus on with all my heart into it. It has always given me immense satisfaction by allowing me to perform whatever I Intended to. Yes outcome was sometimes in my favor and sometimes not, but the essence of learning was always there in whatever I acted upon and that\u2019s what has kept me going.\n\nEnding by, extending my sincere gratitude to all you awesome readers for showering all your love & constantly inspiring me to write more & helping me learn more eventually.\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

So thought to analyze the trend setters which kind of will rule this new year.\n\nSo here is my Top three technology trends you all should look out for in your endeavors in this new year 2018, which as always, will offer you loads of new opportunities to rock this world. Being a part of this mobile app ecosystem I feel immense pride while writing this piece of article for all you visionaries and future mobile apprenuer.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are \u201caugmented\u201d by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, haptics or GPS data.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) is a computer technology that uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user\u2019s physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment.\n\nAs Per Digi-Capital New Report in 2017:\n\nIn 2017 a lot has happened in this AR where Google & Apple invested heavily to harness the true potential of it. Apple has launched ARKit & Google has come up with ARCore, for developer to innovate and create some meaningful mobile solutions for the smartphone users.\n\nAs AR helps in adding a digital layer over virtual information to give a more realistic and unambiguous outlook. AR intertwined apps will gradually empower retail, life science, manufacturing, and many other domains through a wide range AR apps being developed to cater these sectors.\n\nVirtual Reality technologies will be more focused on the game and events sphere as it is already doing so in 2017 and will go beyond to add more evolved app usage experience to offer an elevated dose of entertainment for the gaming user.\n\nWith iPhone X, Apple is trying to change the face of AR by making it a common use case for masses. Also A whole bunch of top tech players think this technology which is also called a mixed reality or immersive environments \u2014 is all set to create a truly digital-physical blended environment for the people who are majorly consuming digital world through their mobile power house"

        "text": "Ethereum Smart Contract Using Solidity, Which You Wished To Create But Didn\u2019t knew How To Start?\n\nBlockchain is the technology working at the core & empowering all the popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoins etc. It has been catching the imaginations of the masses and given them the reason to dream big. Having said that it becomes even more important for developer community & all tech entrepreneurs that they act responsibly to make sure the dreams of millions are given a proper wing so that they can fly with more enthusiasm and with a sense of security. I have already covered the blockchain basics in my previous articles- 1. Blockchain Technology Part 1 : What and Why ? It is recommended that you go through all those basic fundamentals, to have the required understanding before we write our first smart contract. You must have basic fundamental knowledge of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin & Ethereum, Litecoin etc\u2026 You should have some hands-on experience in ANY programming language or scripts (like C, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Shell etc.) We will create our first smart contract using a popular Solidity Framework . So let me first navigate you through some basics of Solidity as a whole. We will cover this journey together in following steps IDE\u2019s & Tools We Need To Get Started. Infographics: To keep You Informed Solidity is a high level language which helps developers to implement smart contracts and extracts it\u2019s essence from C++, Python & JS. Solidity language has been designed to support EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine). Solidity is statically typed and supports inheritance. It comes loaded with a rich set of libraries to help you code with ease. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It has been influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features. With solidity, it is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more\u2026\n\n2. IDE\u2019s & Tools We Need To Get Started. To get started with solidity you need IDE, Some of the popular IDE\u2019s which support solidity plugin giving you all the tools you need to write your codes are: As per official solidity web portal :- Here are few among many IDE\u2019s which supports smart contracts development- Remix- It runs on browser and comes preloaded with code compiler & solidity run time environment IntelliJ IDEA plugin Solidity plugin for IntelliJ IDEA (and all other JetBrains IDEs) Visual Studio Extension Solidity plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio that includes the Solidity compiler. Ethereum Studio Specialized web IDE that also provides shell access to a complete Ethereum environment. evmdis- EVM Disassembler that performs static analysis on the bytecode to provide a higher level of abstraction than raw EVM operations. It can be done in most portable & hassle free way using Emscripten a platform independent JS library. Here is the repository of solc-js. Download it. you will have command line tool called solcjs which you can install using npm as given below- To get Binary packages of Solidity click: solidity/releases. Binary packages of Solidity available at solidity/releases. You can slo download PPAs for Ubuntu. For the latest stable version do this For Cutting edge developer version do this: For more detail about getting through with the Solidity installation please go through : Once you are through configuring Solidity based on your pc/laptops Operating system, you will be all set to start writing your very first Ethereum smart contract. Your Maiden Smart Contract Code Snippet : Are You Excited? & It\u2019s Ok if you are not able to grab some of what has been written we will understand as we go about it in detail. pragma solidity ^0.4.0;// here we define the version of solidity pragma : keyword instructs compiler how to treat the source code written. As you can see we have instructed the compiler about the version of Solidity. A contract structure has two major component- this datas are stored at specific address on Ethereum Blockchain. uint mydata; it is a declaration of data state variable which has a dataype of unsigned integer(of 256 bits size) here the functions set and get helps you to modify or retrieve the value of the variable. Note! In order to access a state variable like mydata, you don\u2019t need the prefix this. as we get to see in many other programming language. Now when you have equipped yourself with some Smart Contract basics, I hope you are excited enough to further decode this smart contract mystery. Every new skills learned should be a adventure for a developer. It should be a fuel to keep you going and to keep you inspired. See i am writing this article out of sheer excitement & with a purpose to learn more and help more fellow developers & blockchain enthusiasts.\n\nThis code snippet has been inspired by solidity official web page * @note Example for the Solidity Course * @dev Just for demo the simple crypto example /// @dev This does not return any value /// @param owner address of the coin owner, amount amount of coins to be delivered to owner declares a state variable of type address that is publicly accessible. The address type is a 160-bit value that does not allow any arithmetic operations. It has public access type so that you can access these data state variable current value it holds, Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access the variable. The function will look something like this: here we are creating a balance type of complex state variable which maps addresses to unsigned integer data type. Here mapping an address uses hash tables which virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros. This event is triggered within the function send where it listens to the. As soon as it is fired, the listener will also receive the arguments from, to and amount, which makes tracking transactions. To listen for this event, you can use below code snippet \u201c coins were sent from \u201c + result.args.from + MyFirstCoin is the constructor which is run during creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It permanently stores the address of the person creating the contract: msg (together with tx and block) is a magic global variable that contains some properties which allow access to the blockchain. msg.sender is always the address where the current (external) function call came from. functions like mint and send, will eventually hold the contracts to enquired by the users & other similar contracts. If anyone other than contract creator tries to access mint it is not possible. Only send method can be used by a person who already have some coins in their kitty to send. 4. Some Infographics: To Keep You Informed: I hope you now have some required understanding of how to write a basic smart contract , next we will further try to understand how EVM ethereum virtual machine function and manages transactions. Some of the things which we will cover in the upcoming series of articles on \u201c Blockchain Using Solidity.\u201d - As I have already spoken in one of my article Top 3 Technology Trends For 2018, Which Will Be A Game Changer ! that Blockchain based tech will be a hot cake in coming years and if one is looking for better career opportunity professionally he should not only keep a close eye on it, but also need to invest some serious time learning the craft of it. Banking, voting, insurance, user authentication, contracting & many more use cases will pop up as the year unfolds, and one should not just let it pass by. As a developer or as an entrepreneur it becomes really important that we adopt this trend and create some innovative solutions which can pass on the benefit to the masses. Already people who never traded in the existing share market have started to invest in their capacity on cryptos, with all excitement to grow their wealth. The ease of creating account & freedom to invest without too much regulation has fascinated many new & first time investor. This is not going to cool of any sooner. With all this open market opportunities, now onus is on all the Technology innovators & Visionaries to utilize this blockchain technology and see what they can come up with, to fire the imagination of the youth, who are going to be an early adopter of what we have to offer. Don\u2019t forget to check out my thoughts on edge computing: All About Edge Computing- How It Is Changing The Present Past & Future Of IoT? which i feel will be a tech trend to watch out in 2018 & beyond.

        "title": "All About Edge Computing- How It Is Changing The Present Past & Future Of IoT?",
        "text": "All About Edge Computing- How It Is Changing The Present Past & Future Of IoT?\n\nUntil you are on the edge, innovation seems impossible. Edge computing has empowered IoT devices to tap data right where it is being generated and process it with more efficiency. Thanks to, Edge Computing evolution, which helps data to travel swiftly to the nearby data centers, which is a kind of boon to this data behemoth. It helps them to save resources and facilitates data processing in quick turnaround time. This edge based IOT partnership is all set to revolutionize data computing and will be a must for various corporate giants, who are looking to leverage & harness the power of data analytics in developing a solution for health care & financial and other major industrial verticals. Telecommunication sector will benefit most from this edge computing tech where they will put this data to optimum use and churn out better offerings for their consumers. A method of optimizing cloud computing systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of the data. This reduces the communications bandwidth needed between sensors and the central data center by performing analytics and knowledge generation at or near the source of the data. This approach requires leveraging resources that may not be continuously connected to a network such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and sensors Doing this computing closer to the edge of the network allows companies to process data & analyse it dynamically in a real time. This data analytics in near real-time is being leveraged by many healthcare, financial & telecommunication and will play a vital role in making them make much more informed business decisions. Helder Antunes, senior director of corporate strategic innovation at Cisco says- \u201cIn most scenarios, the presumption that everything will be in the cloud with a strong and stable fat pipe between the cloud and the edge device \u2014 that\u2019s just not realistic,\u201d Let\u2019s demystify Edge Computing together. We will do this in following phases- What Exactly Do We Mean By Edge Computing ? How Really It Functions?\n\nA. What Exactly Do We Mean By Edge Computing? A mesh network of micro data centers where each one is responsible to receive & process crucial data in their vicinity sent via IoT devices. These small data centers, mines the data and push those data to the main central cloud storage facility. These micro data warehouses generally have a footprint of less than 100 Sq feet. These micro devices which work as data collector & data postman to send it to the main cloud server is called a IoT mesh. Edge computing triages the data locally so some of it is processed locally, reducing the backhaul traffic to the central repository. Edge computing pushes applications, data and computing power (services) away from centralized points to the logical extremes of a network. Edge computing replicates fragments of information across distributed networks of web servers, which may spread over a vast area. As a technological paradigm, edge computing is also referred to[by whom?] as mesh computing, peer-to-peer computing, autonomic (self-healing) computing, grid computing, and by other names implying non-centralized, nodeless availability. Peter Levine, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, believes that cloud computing is soon going to take a back seat to edge computing \u2014 and we will very quickly see the majority of processing taking place at the device level. He has an interesting analogy to Edge Computing(source Techcrunch)- Levine puts it, \u201cThink about a self-driving car, it\u2019s effectively a data center on wheels, and a drone is a data center with wings and a robot is a data center with arms and legs and a [ship] is a floating data center\u2026\u201d He adds, \u201cThese devices are processing vast amounts of information and that information needs to be processed in real time.\u201d What he means is that even the split-second latency required to pass information between these systems and the cloud simply takes too long. Think about a self-driving car, it\u2019s effectively a data center on wheels. B. How Really This Mesh Newtork(Edge Computing) Functions? The below given architecture says it all. At the bottom lies all the smart devices called edge devices(IoT devices )which collects information at the point of user engagement in real time . These data sets are sent across to the edge networks having edge gateways which process these data, do real time lightweight analytics(computing) and send the same to the main data center cloud warehouses.\n\nAny information has to be tapped right where it has been generated & it loses its edge if it is not tapped & analyzed fast Edge computing and analytics can solve the challenge for enterprises ranging from oil and gas production to banks and retailers. Security cameras, phones, machine sensors, thermostats, cars and televisions are just a few of the items in daily use that create data that can be mined and analyzed at various levels and can be processed by various companies, helping them automate their workplace to reduce cost, increase safety & ROI eventually, employing edge computing infrastructure This IIoT(Industrial Internet Of Things) enabler is already being used in various industrial sectors like Oil & Gas : For remote monitoring of oils & gas. It has been employed in top notch Oil & Gas company to detect faults at machinery level before they get to find using predictive analysis. Chemical Industries : It is being used to build smart petroleum refineries where the process is well analyzed to increase productivity & workplace safety. 3. Energy Sector: It is smartly being used in various energy producing industries to reduce their power loss, in making their energy equipment reliable & efficient. Various semi conductor manufacturing companies are using it to reduce their fault rate of microchips Various transportation companies are making use of edge powered IoT devices and computing services to help find the right parking area and reducing their parking downtime. Various AI algorithms are working with these edge devices to optimize parking spaces and for collecting real time traffic & navigation data. They use this analytics to make a much informed decisions. Drone can reach to remote places where humans can\u2019t reach, Edge computing enables them to review data and respond to it in real-time. If, for instance, a drone finds any emergency incident, it can immediately provide valuable information about the wreck to commuters nearby. Augmented Reality- An edge computing platform can support AR services by providing highly localized data specific to the user\u2019s point of interest. Automated vehicles- Self-driving cars are being developed by tech giants like google & Uber where edge computing can play a vital role to process & transmit critical data in the real time to other commuting vehicles . Google and Uber wish to make self-driving cars a consumer reality by 2020. It is hoped automated vehicles will save thousands of lives and billions of dollars related to automobile casualties. IoT devices, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Internet are all brothers & sisters, which are using human intelligence to fuel themselves & working to make this world really smart, closely knitted & super efficient. How Edge Computing is Impacting Cloud Computing \u2014 Analysis brought to you by SWIM- 2. The 5G world(by Intel) : How IoT(Edge Devices )are collaborating with Data Center to create a magical world of Internet Of Things & leveraging the super computing power through promising Edge Computing technology."

Tech industries have continued to expand & evolved at an unbelievable pace and will continue to do so in 2018. Sectors all poised to rule 2018 will be Blockchain based Cryptos will be widely accepted within financial sectors and insurance sectors as a mode of transactions for their consumer based services. Robots will partner with humans to augment their intelligence & help them function efficiently.\n\nWith high speed internet network and 4K HD contents, mobile phone is a new TV for online users. OTT companies like, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google all are going to harness the opportunity to serve their users with high quality video content. In fact, many of these companies are already bidding for the broadcasting rights of sports and are preparing their technology to serve this content to the masses, They are already a threat to the conventional TV media channels & broadcasters.\n\nMany Social media giants are already working to make payment a part of their technology to make payments a hassle free experience for their consumers. New innovation in payments sectors will happen to replace conventional cash system, though it will take its own discourse to happen specially in developing countries where cash is still a norm.\n\nIn this article we will try to assess what innovations are happening and what all crucial technological development will be coming up which will be a trendsetter in 2018 and that will impact to the business owners & their consumers at large.\n\nTraditional broadcaster who owns most of the rights for sports or any show for that matter are getting some serious threat from this Over-The-Top players . like Amazon, Netflix, Apple & Fb are all eyeing it as huge potential and are committing themselves to grab this with full hands. Amazon & Fb will be the largest player to fight for sports broadcasting rights. Various premier leagues pertaining to cricket, Football etc grabs millions of user attention, who love to watch the matches live on their mobile powerhouse. So this social media & eCommerce giants have started to invest heavily on getting all the popular shows & live sports events. Amazon with Amazon prime has already taken the huge leap forward and i believe it will rule the OTT game in coming year. Facebook with its FB live has started to experiment with videos and they will use its huge user base to buy some of those big events rights and use its platform to engage their user making huge profits for themselves."

        "text": "You Don\u2019t Need Motivation You Need Purpose, Passion & Perseverance!\n\nPeople who are out there and chasing their dreams are the ones who never needs an external source of motivation. They are already insanely in love with their work and it is their true driving force. They hardly feel low, they hardly feel bored, they hardly complain about things not happening their way. They are only & only concerned about how much more they can learn & do with whatever time is at their disposal.\n\nwho are self driven and competent to change the world on their own and are smart in making circles of motivated champs to get the required support & thrives in adversity. If you can imbibe these skills and back it your relentless perseverance you will have no time to seek external motivation. You will be self committed & self motivated with all the fire in your belly to go all out and make your dream come true.\n\nHigh achievers always strive for excellence, they pick their shortcomings and work hard to improve fearlessly. They never settle and always try to learn the art of their game they are playing. They set challenging goals for themselves & take calculated risk to achieve it. They seek understanding of the subject and try to collect more information to minimize the chance of failing in their task . They measure their performance and try to improve to master it.\n\nHighly successful people have a clearly defined purpose to pursue. They extract inspiration from the purpose they have set for themselves and relentlessly chase it day & night. Irrespective of the failures on the way they seldom go into negative zone, they learn from it and get the required juice to keep moving from the same failures. They always remember why they started at first. They are consistent with their effort and loves to repeat the success every then & now.\n\nHigh achievers value their profession. They commit themselves to the group or an organization vision and leaves no stone unturned to achieve the set goal. They never bely what they say and are the man of their words. They understand the importance of the task and the value of getting it done in certain timeframe. So they go all ends out to make sure it is done and aligns well with organization\u2019s goal.\n\nThey never allow themselves to be the victim of the circumstances, they decide the goal, they create favorable circumstances & own it fully with extreme optimism to get it accomplished. They are proactive in assessing the situation & learn from it, They do their homework right and take the required initiatives to come out as a winner.\n\nTherefore i always say-\n\nOptimism feeds the person with required mindset & initiatives lead to the required action. If you lack optimism you will never ever succeed in your endeavor whatsoever.\n\nGreat People have always relied on cultivating necessary understanding of things what they have decide to do. They don\u2019t simply believe in things rather, they get into the depth of it before coming to any kinds of conclusion. They increase their consciousness level to cultivate required knowledge and keep a close eye on everything happening around. With increased awareness they developed the solid perception to see & do things.\n\nBe a seeker in your life and you will always have exciting and challenging things to do, with so much to achieve how one can be depressed and unmotivated? I really can\u2019t understand this, It\u2019s a crime to be living in such a pity state, for me it\u2019s a waste of being a human being. Inspiration & motivation is like a treasure chest which lies right inside you, you just need right reason and right understanding to unlock it. You don\u2019t need external forces to dig it out for you, they can only be a support system and an extension to your own motivated self.\n\nTo unlock yourself fully you just need to be honest with yourself in choosing a goal, give up all your fears which never exists, learn what is required and unlearn what is a garbage. Try new things, take measured risk and see that you are growing everyday, improving everyday."

        "text": "A Quick LiteCoin Crypto Primer For All You Dreamers!\n\nCryptocurrencies viz. Bitcoins, Ethereum, Litecoins, BitCoin Cash, Ripple have been making a lot of buzz and is a talk of the town across the globe. Everyone has started to see a potential opportunity to be a millionaire or billionaire . Some are cautious and some nervous seeing the rising valuation(bubble) of all cryptos. Some had tasted the success some had lost lots of money, some feel being missed out & some still see it as an alien and are puzzled to know more about it.\n\nOverall, this digital currency is impacting one & all in some or the other way. So let me take this opportunity to enlighten you all with WTF of Cryptos .\n\nWe will cover this journey in following phases-\n\nA virtual currency, which employs cryptography to secure the digital currency transactions between senders & receivers. Being highly secure it is difficult to counterfeit cryptos.\n\nTo define in the most simplistic form I would like to put it in this way:\n\nThe first cryptocurrency to capture the public imagination was Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSome of the popular digital cryptos are\n\nLitecoin like others cryptos is making a lot of news these days specially after its founder, Charlie Lee, the former director of engineering at Coinbase, decided to sell almost all of his holdings in Litecoin (LTC), the cryptocurrency that he founded in 2011(As reported on Techcrunch).\n\nWe will cover Litecoin in details in the following manner:\n\nLitecoin was first launched in 2011 by Charlie Lee, as an alternate to Bitcoin currency with an aim of being the \u201csilver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cgold,\u201d. Since its inception it has gained massive popularity and currently rank as 5th most traded currency based with a market cap of $18,001,558(source).\n\nIt uses peer-2 peer network and is fully decentralized & open source like its peer bitcoin & is primarily used as a global payment network.\n\nLitecoin technically produces 4 times more coins than Bitcoin and that too at a faster rate (1/4th of the time of Bitcoin).\n\nTo understand the Litecoins working we need to see it in two phases:\n\nLotecoin is not regulated by any government like traditional physical money, instead it is created by a secure & transparent mechanism of mining through comprehensive process. There can only be 84 million Litecoins which can float within a market. Litecoin network produces a Block in every 2.5 minutes as a ledger entry and this entry is verified by a mining software. Mining makes block visible to the miner who to see it and verify,Once a miner verifies it, the next block enters the chain, which is a record of every litecoin transaction.\n\nLitecoin uses hashing algo to solve a block to maintain a count of how many coins are in distribution each time a solution is found for the block being verified. Each new transaction made is grouped with other recent transactions with a secured blocks. While mining, miners use their computers GPU/CPU cycles to run the complex mathematical algorithms to verify the transaction allocated in crypto blocks, using their predefined algo. This process of solving the bocks happens until their collective power discovers a solution, It is at this point that all transactions within the respective block are fully verified and stamped as legitimate.\n\nMiners are rewarded with predefined no of Litecoins for their hard work they put into solving the blocks. The strongest & power miners have the largest chunk of litecoins. If you want to be one of them, you can join the pool, where their computing power is combined with others in the group to obtain these rewards.\n\nMiners are currently awarded with 25 new litecoins per block, an amount which gets halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks).\n\nLitecoin differs with bitcoin as it uses memory intensive algo called as scrypt while bitcoin utilizes SHA -256 Hashing algo and accordingly miner has to mine with different hardware configuration for both types of coins.\n\nIf you are looking to invest in Litecoin it can be done by buying & selling using some of the popular digital currency trading exchanges. You can buy & sell litecoins using any of the currency you have. Please make sure you identify Litecoin as LTC or XLT before buying it on exchanges. Also, it is recommended that you read all the compliances pertaining to CCSS and KYC/AML regulations based on your country of investment, if you are a business.

        "title": "Leaders Are You Living In The Blind Spot ? \u2013",
        "text": "Leaders Are You Living In The Blind Spot ?\n\nBeing in a leadership position within an organization, how many times we know that there is something wrong with us, but never accept those feelings within us, with a fear to be exposed, we try to hide our emotional trauma by trying to portray ourselves comfortable externally to fool ourselves being ok. We very often do this to self-protect from the possible distress that would arouse due to the harsh reality which may pop up.\n\nWe try to be defensive by curtailing the facts, putting filters against the information, way too much rationalization and making excuse look good , we do everything to fool our weak emotions and denying our emotional truth. Is it healthy ? No It\u2019s a crime to live in self denial state.\n\nBeing in a top position after competing all the way up, sometimes stop us from admitting our weakness, fearing the same competition which exists very often within an organizational political structure. To survive, we ignore our shortcomings and start living in a state of self ignorance which we call A state of \u201cBLIND SPOT\u201d. If we are working at higher level it really hurts the productivity of the entire group of which you are a leader and it becomes difficult to hide the same as it is always under bigger scanner. At lower levels, it hardly get\u2019s noticed and can be ignored, but at upper level, it is bound to be visible and questioned.\n\nRobert E. Kaplan studied these blind spot signals by interviewing and observing top executives from different companies ranging from leads, to heads to CEO\u2019s and came up with the following reasons leading to blind spots :(As mentioned by Daniel Goleman in his book Working With Emotional Intelligence) where people are ignoring the known facts and are adamant to accept their shortcomings. They overplay their strengths ignoring their pitfalls eventually living in blind spots.\n\nLet us cover one by one to further understand what blind spots are ? And why it happens ?\n\nIn an organization, we very often find people working at top level(it also happens at lower level) playing hard to always win at all costs and in the process of looking strong & right, ignore the situational wisdom required. They blindly compete, do not cooperate to sound the best, exaggerate their strength and past contributions, becomes arrogant and judgmental towards colleague, to protect their status. They know from within that they are not right but to safeguard their aura and stature ignore it all and try to pacify their unrealistic blind ambitions\n\nIn-order to look extra productive top notch people often set unrealistic targets for their peers and for themselves.Setting this overly ambitious goals puts them into a mode where they enforce people around to stretch themselves, leading to burnouts. May be targets gets achieved under extreme pressure but overall we lose the vitality as a whole. They become ignorant to the fact that targets are unrealistic and may damage the system but nevertheless they ignore and create a blind spot for themselves to satisfy their ego.\n\nTo prove the point we overstretch ourselves. Out of compulsions we overwork keeping all other things in our life aside. Result we burnout ourselves and sometimes disengage with people around.\n\nThey want it all. They are power seekers and mostly act for their self vested interest, putting themselves first over organizations and team. People living with this blind spot ailment micromanage and endorse their personal agenda, ignoring others perspective which is kind of precarious and exploitative.\n\nPeople with this blind spot ailment often snatch credits from others to get an unfair recognition, To get all the glory they play the blame game and demean others effort , they ignore follow-through for the sake of being victorious. To get recognition they play it foul , its is really a very dangerous state to be in.\n\nThey give a lot of importance of their public image and how they are looking externally. They try to look good & are over possessive about their appearances. So they fake it out unnecessarily and craves for material trappings to look prestigious.\n\nThey are often enraged by others criticism and ignore the realism. They blame others for their failures to look perfect. It is very hard for them to admit that they are not always right and ignore their weakness very often.\n\nPeople with this ailment are often motivated to ignore their weakness and avoid being self-aware & realistic. They fear that being self-aware will put them into place where they will have to acknowledge their weaknesses which they fear bearing. These kinds of self denial practices often makes them very reluctant to feedbacks and working with them within any organizational structure becomes practically impossible.\n\nTo be leader of some substance and charisma you can\u2019t live in your past rosy world where you were star performer, you need to understand that every new assignment, every new workplace is different and people with you are expected to work, may be different from your past workplace. They may have some great ideas to share which can make your life easy while leading if you give your ears to them.\n\nBeing in the top position of power should not cripple you in such a manner that you get into the self denial mode. You may have shortcomings and it is ok to not know it all, this understanding will open you up for feedbacks from other people and help you really shine in trying situations. Don\u2019t be insecure about your position, you need to learn the art of transformational leadership, where you endorse other people\u2019s skills and promote them often & reward them, As a top notch leader your job is to be an enabler in empowering others which eventually gives you the required power to influence other people and get your task done.\n\nThere is no point being overly protective of your own self created image, yes you have the proven track record so what, it may be the case that others may have the skills to get that particular task done more better than you, it doesn\u2019t mean that they will dethrone you, it\u2019s your imagination and you have to come out of it. Leading is the art of giving and getting back the unexpected. When you accept your weakness and listen to others feedback it helps to improve you more as a leader and enhances your performance & perception of life.\n\nWhen you stop denying your low feelings and become true to accept your loopholes you become more self aware. To be in a state of self awareness helps you to be open minded. When you know that you are not perfect and has to work hard to improve irrespective of your position, you address to your inner calling and start to change. You identify what is needed to polish your weaknesses and use your strength to overcome that.\n\nTake help from others, respect your inner feelings, yes it is not easy to fit into the expectations of your positions, but that should not force you to act blindly and enforce the unrealistic demand from yourself and your team. It damages more than saving your stature. The Best solution would be to talk to all the peoples involved, get the views & opinions of all, create a consensus, keeping everybody well informed, cutting down the unrealistic demands and work together as an inclusive & integrated unit with one single agenda to pursue.\n\nSome of my other contributions which may kind of interest you:\n\nEnding with a sense of gratitude to Thank You all, for reading it all all the way down and being a true inspiration for me to help me write more"

        "title": "How To Inculcate & Cultivate The Art Of Influencing?",
        "text": "How To Inculcate & Cultivate The Art Of Influencing?\n\nFor most part of your career specially if you are in leadership position you have to deal with people to get your task done, or to convince your client to crack a business deal. You have to sell yourself everyday to be a successful business leader.\n\nThe ability to influence people is a crucial skill in varied dimension of modern day working life \u2014 whether you are working in cross-functional teams, managing external supplier relationships or networking with potential new clients. So what it takes to be a influential leader ? What is takes, to be able to workout the positive outcome? Irrespective of the adverse situation, is what we will try to decode .\n\nBut first allow me to put forth the required social competencies which helps you to successfully manage other people\u2019s emotions artfully-\n\nSo among many competencies INFLUENCE is what we will dig deeper to help you understand how you can win people\u2019s heart and persuade them to listen you and act.\n\nWhat are the characteristics of people with this competency skill:\n\nTo convince you should never force, instead empathize and be subtle in your process of building a rapport for yourself to influence persuasion.\n\nEmpathizing is a mandatory to wield influence. It will be really impossible for someone to have a positive impact on others without first making a emotional connect with them . You can never convince people to buy your idea until you know how they are feeling about it. So it is always effective to first make a connect with them understand them and build a positive rapport for yourself by fitting into their shoes.\n\nGive your ears first & then bring your intellect to speak up, Too much mouth and less ears leads to disengagement\n\nThis art involves building relationships by expressing your feelings and identifying those feelings in others. Being a leader you should often ask your colleagues, how they feel, how their work is progressing, what they feel are obstacles to their success, how they feel about the work and the workload they have. Asking and getting involved with your team members, in the work process, helps to develop a relationship which can influence them from deep within.\n\nVery seldom i have seen people leaning back & Ask. I feel the more we ask, the more we engage and less we have to tell to get the task done.\n\nAs a leader you always need to ask yourself-\n\nTrust wields influence to the larger extent and to build the trust you have to show the way how to do something you expect from others . At the heart of credibility is how you set a personal example, you need to follow-through on commitments, and hold others to the same values and standards.\n\nYou also need to ask yourself :\n\nAre you consistent & reliable as a leader of your troop ?\n\nIf you can consistently deliver the expected and get the same out of others you win the required credibility as as leader who can walk the talk .\n\nBeing into a position of leadership is always put to scanners specially when situations are difficult & you have to deal with difficult people to get the task done and yes it is not easy. In that phase knowing how to respond rather than react become really important. If you try to enforce & use an overt challenge as a tool for being heard it may not work, instead giving your ears to the situations and responding will lead to ease out the situation and may wake way for healthy discussion and perhaps to the solutions which works well for everyone.\n\nWhen you start treating others the way you want yourself to be treated you increase your chances to phase out the negativity within the the group of people or an individual & can build the required consensus. Being responsive to the people you create opportunity for everyone to succeed.\n\nTreating others with respectful firmness when being faced with negativity, argumentativeness, and rudeness, increases the likelihood that a difficult situation will become an opportunity\n\nTo be an influential leader it is crucial that you don\u2019t always fake it out. Being honest & authentic wins more heart and helps you build your credibility as a charismatic leader for long run.\n\nWhen people accept for who you are as a leader and trust you for your wisdom you earn the power to build consensus on any issue. Authenticity leader attract great team members to work together with him, It is always favorable to be powerful and being liked for being so. It helps to negotiate, influence people and leads to positive outcome very often than not.\n\nOne important characteristics of truly authentic & impactful leader is that they often summarize what they have heard and end with some expression of gratitude.They always ask for the feedback and take it seriously to cultivate the art of persuasion.\n\nTo be a powerful influential leader you need to practice the art of asking before telling. Being a leaders you can\u2019t command people and try to get your orders delivered, instead you need to be empathic to understand their needs and then build a consensus by inclusion, yes it is not always easy when there are some difficult brain sitting, but if you can lead by example and be more authentic you can persuade.\n\nSome of my others articles which can be useful for you all:\n\nSigning off with a sense of gratitude to Thank You all, for reading it all all the way down and being a true inspiration for me to help me write more\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

        "text": "To Be A Transformational Leader, You Don\u2019t Always Need To Be Innovative, You Just Need To Be Emotionally Intelligent!\n\nAs an entrepreneur & a leader of a small troop who are hustling it with a strong sense of purpose\n\nA change leaders are not only open to new values and new ideas of change, but also understands that to get these new changes implemented, they need to first arouse the change within the people from the core. Traditional Management practices of rewarding and promoting hardly works well, when company is riding the wave of change.\n\nThese companies don\u2019t needs innovators they need a mindful and inspiring leader who knows to manage their own emotions and the emotions of the people whom they are working with, exceptionally well. They know how to work with diverse set of people and give them a strong sense of purpose to be followed inclusively. They leverage the diversity to properly channelize the task and make people feel more accountable and responsible.\n\nNow it becomes important that we first try to understand What actually Transformational Leadership is all about? & What are the traits of these kind leaders of change ?\n\nIn one of my friends company everyone has a high regard for Rahul as a leader(Name Changed), they love to work with him and are extremely loyal to him, Rahul leads a team of 5 people from various backgrounds and this team is called the champ within an organization, they are highly result oriented and successful as a unit.\n\nIn comparison to Rahul, Other leaders from a different department, reports frequently to the management about how their team members are often disengaged and are not able to delegate their task as per their instruction, These group of people are having no sense of purpose and clear cut direction to perform, result high attritions and lowered performance.\n\nWhy do you think Rahul has been so successful even though at organizational level all work in the same company ? Well Its is because Rahul Is a Leaders Of Change and that is what we will uncover together as we proceed.\n\nThe very first time this term was coined by James V. Downton, which was enhanced by developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer James MacGregor Burns, according to Burns,\n\n\u201c Transformational leadership can be seen when \u201cleaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\u201d Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \u201cgive and take\u201d relationship, but on the leader\u2019s personality, traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals.\u201d\n\nTwo of the greatest leader of their time Nelson Mandela & Mahatma Gandhi exemplified the transformational leadership. They motivated everyone who came in their influence to attain exceptional accomplishments, through charisma, inspiration, individualized attention and intellectual stimulation.\n\nHe has beautifully crafted what is required to be a transformational leaders in above covering the true attribute one needs to inculcate if they want to a successful leader of a change within an organization.\n\nSo let\u2019s go ahead to understand the characteristics one needs to be a leaders of a change, to be a emotionally competent leader or to be a transformational leader\n\n2. The Don\u2019t Fear To Take Hard Decisions To Foster The Change :\n\nTransformational leaders know that to bring any kind of change they will have to take some difficult decisions but in the process doing so, they ensure, it is made easier by aligning it with clear clearly defined vision, values, goals, and objectives.\n\n3. They Take Risk But Take It Calculatively & Responsibly :\n\nThe leaders of change seldom fears taking risk but they don\u2019t do it blindly. They have this understanding that in their position of power, they have a responsibility to shape the life of many people working with them. So they include everyone, listens and takes everyone\u2019s input, to back it with their ingenious intellect, proper evaluation & intuition before deciding. Very often than not the their risk taking abilities leads to positive outcome. If it doesn\u2019t work out as intended they take accountability with pure honesty.\n\nThere are many more characteristics of a Transformational leaders viz. ,\n\nSigning off with a sense of gratitude to Thank You all, for reading it all all the way down and being a true inspiration for me to help me write more\n\nFor More Such Articles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

        "text": "A Quick Ripple Primer To Make You An Informed User!\n\nI have covered more, about Bitcoins in some of my previous articles, but there are also other promising digital currency, which uses cryptography & the blockchain technology and catching up right there in terms of being cost effective, promising high return .\n\nPlease refer my links below to know all the basics of Bitcoin & Blockchain :\n\nBitcoins : Refer this link to know more All You Wanted To know About Bitcoins\n\nWe will today cover Ripple in detail, to help you understand its basics.\n\nRipple is quite different from other cryptocurrencies as it doesn\u2019t have its own public blockchain. Internally, the XRP Ledger network runs on an internal blockchain which they call an \u201cEnterprise blockchain\u201d ledger, it doesn\u2019t use proof-of-work and little else is known about it.\n\nRipple functions like RTGS and is a digital currency exchange developed by Ripple company . Ripple was released officially in 2012 with an intent to enable instant & secure financial transactions of any size with no chargeback. It is currently a world third largest digital currency.\n\nRipple does share some technical similarities with bitcoin but it is quite different from it. Like many digital currencies it uses cryptography to secure transactions, but it doesn\u2019t actually have a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Litecoin. And it came into existence to mainly transform the payment transfer system, for the purpose of sending instant and secure transactions across network participants and that what is more known for.\n\nRipple is more like payment system, remittance network, and currency exchange & now Ripple has built its network that includes its own cryptocurrency Ripple, or XRP.\n\nRipple Transaction Protocol or simply we can call Ripple Payment Protocol uses distributed open source Internet Protocol, consensus ledger & native crypto called XRP(Ripples). Ripples circles around shared database or public ledger which uses a consensus mechanism to allow payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.\n\nThe goal of the ripple system, according to its official web portal, is to enable people to break free of the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of financial networks \u2014 ie, credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays."

        "text": "Value Your Time And Start Taking Action, Your Time Starts Now!\n\nHuman Beings are the only living being who has got the necessary intellect and skills to fully utilize every second of their life. Then why is it that we give least respect to the most priceless asset given to us by almighty, We always complain of having less time on our side even though it\u2019s in abundance and cost you nothing(in numbers). The answer lies in our very nature of existence, we don\u2019t like to be stretched, if someone tries to pull us out of our comfort zone, we revolt, we are more happy being lazy and that\u2019s why we never make it on time.\n\nBeing lazy and lethargic is destroying our ability to harness the real potential of being human. So it\u2019s high time that we act and start counting every second of our life to be an opportunity to get what we strongly desire. We can\u2019t postpone the best to happen, just because the time is not right, we need to be very clear that time will never be perfect it is us who has to adopt and change to fit into the current context of our life.\n\nWe very often Procrastinate voluntarily to attain to some task which seems unpleasant to us, but the reality is that, with this task which we don\u2019t feel comfortable or right to do at this moment and postpone, adds to our life\u2019s misery, which we very often don\u2019t realize. When we procrastinate, we pass the buck to our future self.\n\nLeaving things to future which never comes is going to slowly kill your innate potential, Instead, understanding the importance of the task and getting it done in the moment will help you save more to do more. If you can work over your habit of postponing and organize yourself more to plan & prioritize right you may never need to do so\n\nWe have to polish ourself every moment and better ourself with time. We need to change our attitude towards life and focus on our best instead of talking & thinking too much about the negative things happening around. You as an individual have all the necessary ingredients to outshine yourself, You just need to work upon yourself in understanding precisely your innate strength & weakness and focus on improving your weaknesses & practicing more to strengthen what you are good at.\n\nProcrastination works against our talent and skills by obstructing it to be actionable. We have the potential, but to get out of comfort zone not comes easily to everyone until we are willing enough & are driven by purpose to achieve.\n\nSo stop postponing, find your purpose & start acting, time will always be with you if you are ready to embrace it and walk with an attitude of learning & utilizing every bit of it.\n\nDon\u2019t simply believe and get controlled by your desire, Instead, take control of your valuable time to invest it in learning & understanding the things. If you want to get something done, only having a desire is not going to help, having a deep understanding of how you will reach your goals, learning from all possible sources which can help you reach there will put you in the right direction. Until you understand the requirements of doing something how can you attempt to get it done, you have to experience it first irrespective of its outcome to cultivate the required skills which can help you get what you intend.\n\nFor More Such Artciles You Can Also Check Out My Personal Blog :"

        "title": "What Leads To Lower Performance & Burnout In An Organization?",
        "text": "What Leads To Lower Performance & Burnout In An Organization?\n\nOrganizations small or big sometimes unknowingly(can be knowingly too) implements some management practices without assessing the outcome it will lead to. Very often it leads to employee burnout and costs to the company hugely in term of productive outcome. According to one study, which Daniel Goleman mentioned in his book Working With Emotional Intelligence, which is a 20 year series of study, there is an enlightening insight based on feedbacks & interviews, about the ways companies are burning out their employees leading to their lower performance.\n\nLet\u2019s decode what this study has to say about the factors which is a kind of impacting the morale of the working class and eventually demoralizing and demotivating them. Any organization should learn from this study and should implant best practices within an organizational unit, which is more a game enabler rather than being a game stopper.\n\nThis is a global phenomenon across many organizations, due to peer pressure and stiff market competitions, they are giving unrealistic targets to be accomplished to their workforce, eventually overloading them. They have not scaled their support systems to sustain this work requirement, instead they demand more to be delivered with less resources to support the same.\n\nLeads & HOD\u2019s are expected to manage the rising demand with less resources at their disposal leading them to feel overwhelming pressure, It exhausts them, results in lower performance and a sense of insecurity within an organization.\n\nIt is a proven fact that when your mind is set free and is without fear you perform at your peak, but this power of autonomy is rarely given to the working executives & leaders, they have a set accountability but very little say in how to go about their task. Micromanagement within an organization often leads to frustration & chaos. Manier times people have a better understanding of how to approach their work, but little freedom. Rigid protocols cripple them and holds them back. This all results to lack of interest & innovation in their work.\n\nHey Decisions Makers, How would you feel if you invest an effort worth $100 and you get $80 in returns would you be happy ? Obviously Disappointed Right ! Then how can you pay your workforce less, who is earning it for you .\n\nVery often it is the case, employees are paid less for more work they deliver, to minimize the loss companies go for cost cutting, where jobs are cut down, wage freezes, work is outsourced and HR benefits like health coverage is taken away, it all leads to people insecurity and hampers the career growth for the workforce. When incentives are taken away people go weak emotionally and makes them less disinterested.\n\nSo as an owner if you want to be in the business for long , you need to spend more on people\u2019s wellbeing, give them the required autonomy , respect their effort, let them have their say, inclusion will encourage them to be involved and deliver more in less time. Cost cutting to improve financial books will seldom save you, but sharing and caring will definitely put you on a driver\u2019s seat and eventually make money for all.\n\nWhen people working in an organization are put to churn out more than their capacity they find it difficult to sustain, in the pressure of performing they often gets disconnected with their team members. Their relationship with their peers which works like a glue to help teams perform at their peek are often gets disrupted due to unrealistic demands. This relationship fragmentation often lowers the commitment level to work within a group, that pleasure of working as a team erodes under work pressure. Resulting in a growing sense of alienation among them, which fuels conflicts, chaos and creates a rift between team members and management. This disconnect sometimes becomes irreparable and calls for the organization doom.\n\nIf there is any mismatch between individual\u2019s core working principles and the amount of work being demanded, it may lead them to compromise with their work ethics & company values. They will often lie to sell more, skipping some standard work practices to satisfy the demands. Under the pressure they will ensure their survival in this vicious competition is taken care so they will adopt some immoral ways to attain to the extra demands, which ultimately will damage companies values & market reputation. Also, people at work will get guilt conscious, demoralized and will feel unworthy about themselves. Nobody wants to adopt wrong practices knowingly, but are forced to compromise due to impractical work demands.\n\nAll the above practices within an organization is really dangerous for its survival, it breeds chronic exhaustion, cynicism & lack of motivation, enthusiasm & productivity. Companies have to churn out best emotionally intelligent practices like \u2014\n\nFor more, do check out: www.techprenuer.com where i very often share my learning for all you lovely readers.\n\nAlso You Can Follow Me On:"

Today we will get into some technical nitty-gritty of NLP. Before that lets refresh our memories and cover the basics again so that right context is set for the technical discussion of NLP Programming\n\nWhen natural meets artificial, machine comes to life as if it is a real human in action.\n\nIt\u2019s a stream of Artificial intelligence where machine meets human language giving them words to communicate with humans. It involves intelligent analysis of written language using NLP techniques to get insights from set of textual data like\n\nNLP is classified basically into two major components\n\nIt is the process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language from some internal representation.\n\nThere are many popular third party open source libraries which developers can use to build their NLP based Projects Viz..\n\nNatural language toolkit (NLTK) is the most popular library for natural language processing (NLP).

Every second of being human has to be valued and invested in learning to make something happen.\n\nWe have all the potential to break the boundaries around us which we have built over the period of time and it needs to be broken if something new has to take birth inside us. We have to have our To-do List in place to walk through our entire day, yes it is not possible to plan 100% of our time as the life is more dynamic to be planned, but at-least we need to have our task cut-out so that we don\u2019t go about it hayway.\n\nFlow with life freely, fearlessly and confidently with your target clearly defined & purpose to live with. Be open to change and be ready to meet new people whom you may not feel comfortable in the first place to meet, but I can bet, the more you face them, more you will come to know about life. But if you prefer not to face challenges and explore new things you are wasting the great life you have been given to live.\n\nTime is available equally for every single human being alive, some make judicious use of it to change the course of their own & others life, do not simply exist waiting time to pass by and crawling through the life. I consider that you are blessed to be human, and you can\u2019t simply live through, you have to have that fire, that desire to bring a change in the world you are living in . Yes, you can make your mark, you have all what is required to live like a champion. It all boils down to choices which you make in the moment.\n\nThe series of Thought will continue\u2026.. And i will keep sharing as it comes across \u2026\n\nSome of my previous articles which may interest you :\n\nfor more, do check out : www.techprenuer.com where i very often share my learning for all you lovely readers .\n\nFor Any Kind Or Project Development & Consulting You can directly write me at: pramod.pandey@mobibittech.com or Skype me: pramod.pandey83 and would try my best to attend, to your queries.\n\nAlso You Can Follow Me On:"

If they can increase their level of conscious awareness they can easily offload the burdens which never existed in reality.\n\nSo how the leaders at the top of the ladder should play the game of life, so that they change the whole myth of pressure, It needs some special skills which all the leaders do understand but don\u2019t often act upon.\n\nWorkplace needs an excellent team synchronization and everyone in the team has different skill-sets, now to bring them on a single platform and setting up a common goal, can sometimes be a daunting task, if we as a leader don\u2019t attune to the needs and skills of every individual participating in the game, the risk is higher that we can end up with lots of chaos.\n\nSo first leader should let go their ego or position, if they consider having one, and come down to the level of every team player to accept them based on their individual traits and needs. This is only possible if we first learn to come to the terms that we are dealing with highly talented individuals who are more than a commodity, they are not an emotion less machine who can be put on auto pilot mode and expected to produce perfect deliveries all the time they play, they are human being with infinite possibilities, they just need a spark and congenial platform and a little bit of fine tuning to adapt, rest leave them, they will outshine themselves."

        "text": "It Is Good To Be Called Childish And You Should Feel Proud To Be A Child Like?\n\nHow often you have heard this statement?\n\nVery often, right!\n\nI get to hear this very often even though I am a grown up father of a 6 year old daughter. How do you react to this statement? For me it is a fun and makes me feel proud to be compared with a child. Because,\n\nLet\u2019s understand 2 important life lessons which you can learn from your own kids and from any child around for that matter, which kind of will help you grow more as an adult and can inspire you to live more and love more.\n\nI am so amused everytime i see my daughter doing things. She never claims to know everything in fact, she questions everything and try to figure out why? Around her queries to find the answer. And if she is not able to find it, she comes to me to bombard with her insane queries. No, I am not irritated infact It helps me to learn a few new things which i would have not learned otherwise. You know what? The beauty of being a child is that they are always open to new things and never hesitate to try & learn. This habit of a child should be picked up by every grown up, if they really want to see themselves growing and achieving larger goals in their life.\n\nTherefor I very Often Quote:\n\n\u201c This attitude that it\u2019s ok not to know will open doors for all the knowings of the unknown \u201c\n\nSo from now on if someone say you are behaving like a child, You should feel proud to see yourself alive to new things and growing.\n\nHave you closely observed your child? They never seem to give up if they want to do something, they are extremely patient, they constantly try even though they fail multiple times. Sometime the task they are trying to achieve is not possible to be done at their small age, but they anyway give a try until their parents or any adult intervene and stops them from doing so.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it happens? It is because they do not think about the outcome, what is important for them is to try to attain to their queries which has kind of challenged them. They are a fearless soul who has no fear of loosing as they having nothing to gain. It\u2019s just their desire to try, which fires them up and gives them immense pleasure of trying things.\n\nWe adult need to increase our consciousness level and be receptive to our child\u2019s activity to learn. Next time when you want to do something which seems impossible, seek inspiration from these small kids and attempt it, so what if you fail, you must be proud for at least trying. I can bet, you will be blissful from deep within and that should make you feel like a real warrior who fought bravely.\n\nTherefore, I always say:\n\n\u201c It is better to be a life long student and keep learning new things like a child, then to be an expert in one field of a life \u201c\n\nI would like to sign-off with a small request to all you lovely parents, when I say that you should learn from your child the art of seeing everything as a possibility, it\u2019s also very important that you are not curtailing your child\u2019s aspiration to learn things by uttering this precarious statement:\n\nFor more, do check out: www.techprenuer.com where i very often share my learning for all you awesome readers."

        "text": "All You Wanted To Know About BitCoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009, which you can also call a Cryptocurrency which is becoming a popular digital payment solution worldwide. Bitcoins are a piece of code that are digitally signed each time a transaction happens from one owner to the next, these transactions can be made anonymously making it a kind of currency which can lead to its misue. Bitcoin is the first decentralised cryptocurrecy where there is no centralised vigilant or administarator who monitor the transactions happening with it.\n\nIt uses the networking system which is peer-to-peer in nature, where transactions take place between users directly through the use of cryptography, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in an immutable public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\n\nWe will understand its working through following phases :\n\nWith Bitcoin to pay and get paid is aweomely easy and accessible to everyone. But to engage into any kind of transaction you first need to install a Bitcoin Wallet. After you installed the wallet on your machine or mobile phone, wallet will generate a unique Bitcoin address, this address can be disclosed to your trusted user with whom you want to transact but remember this address can only be used once .\n\nOnce you have installed a Bitcoin wallet on your computer or mobile phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works, except that Bitcoin addresses should only be used once.\n\nAs we discussed earlier Bitcoin currency uses blockchain mechanism to transact, which is a shared public ledger. All verified transaction is stored in this block chain ledger. Bitcoin utilises this records to keep track of their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity, security and the order sequences of the block chain transactions are managed with cryptography technique.\n\nA transaction happens between parties involved where the sender sets the certain value to be digital record which gets registered into the block chain.This trsanction records get digitally signed by bitcoin wallet using private key with a mathematical proof of the owner of the wallet who intiated the transaction. The signature ensures that the transaction is not altered by third party, once it has been issued. Bitcoin wallet uses a process of mining to confirm the transaction being boradcast between users and usually it is done by the network in the following 10 minutes.\n\nBitcoin Wallet Systems uses a distributed consensus system called Mining to confirm waiting transactions & maintains their chronological order in the block chain. It protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system.\n\nAll the transaction needs to be packed in a block with a strong crytopgraphic protocols to be verified by the blockchain networks.These Protocols prevent previous blocks from being modified as doing so would invalidate all the following blocks.\n\nMining also creates the kind of a competitive lottery based system that blocks any individual from easily adding any new blocks consecutively in the block chain.\n\nIt is highly recommended to know some important facts for any user who is about to use bitcoin wallet systems for transacting , which you can refer from the given link of Bitcoin.org\n\nHope it helps to further strengthen you knowledge on Bitcoins.\n\nIn order to invest in Bitcon you need these two things to start with :\n\nWe will cover a bit about exchanges in this artcles & cover wallet in details in upcoming article, in my series on Bitcoin\n\nIf you happen to be living in country which have an official have an official Bitcoin exchange, you can quickly sign up for these exchanges and transfer money from your bank account to purchase Bitcoins.\n\nSome of the trusted & popular bitcoin exchanges based on countries are:\n\nBut what if you are not having an offcial bitcoin exchage in your country . It can be a challenge to manage your first bitcoin purchase but there are some alternative way which can help you do so. Though a bit risky but you can try\n\nHere are few websites from where you can buy Bitcoins & some other alternatives :\n\nHere is a list of sites that allows buying Bitcoins using Credit/Debit card:\n\nBitcoin investment is not regulated so it can be sometimes a bit risky if proper care & security practises has not been followed, which you often get from the webportal & wallets once you start usinf them. It is recommended that you read all the protocols & best practice guides provided by your wallet & web portal service providers.\n\nTo sum up the things for you i am attaching a wonderful infographics which will explain it all for you in a beautiful way :"

It is a pattern of human behavior, which holds the most important place in every sphere of life. It helps you succeed and shine with flying colors.\n\nYou want to be a great computer programmer or a great medical practitioner, or a supreme athlete, one thing which you need to practice a lot is how to be consistent in your task. To master the art of being excellent requires you to sharpen your skills on a consistent basis. A small success should not stop you to improve, instead you need to work harder, if you want to continuously remain at the top of your business you need to invest yourself in being consistent with your input.\n\nVirat Kohli India\u2019s Ace Cricketer is Breaking all records in cricket and has made a remarkable name for himself in such a short period of time, you know why he has been able to achieve this feat, it\u2019s his sheer consistency and grit to improve with time which has made him so successful as a cricket.

If you can carry it digitally try to always revisit it & keep reminding yourself about why you are doing what you are doing? Having defined your purpose now complement it with your consistency . Your approach should not be short-term instead have a long term vision and work hard everyday to learn the art which will make you an inch better everyday.\n\nGreat business leaders have their own share of challenges, but their approach to tackle it is inspired by their purpose to do so. They have a clear cut agenda and they pursue it with great consistency, with a long-term vision in place they set small small milestones and work on it without failing. They understand this mantra \u2014\n\nBeing a hustler and a father of Mobibit one thing which has clearly helped me to continue doing what i am doing is \u201cConsistency & Perseverance\u201d and i have a clear conviction that if i can keep improving and polishing myself as an individual I will be able to shape my fellow members life in much better way, which will eventually push me closer to my desired goal & lifelong purpose, of being useful to everyone who comes in touch with me in my small journey.

The key is to see that you are acting fast and not wasting too much time over-thinking.\n\nDo you know how much time we simply let slip through planning in our mind and never make it actionable.

        "text": "How you kick-start your day? what you say? what you do? how you do it? are few questions among many which one need to ask to themselves everyday. Asking questions is the most powerful tool to get closer to your goals with every second passing by. And if you are planning to startup you need to first have an answer for Why, What & How ? Of their product idea. Yes there will be failures, but that will put you in right directions and help you learn the tricks of getting things right.\n\nToday i will share few of those crucial questions which one needs to find answers for, before one plans to take that plunge to StartUp .\n\nHaving a great idea which you think is great is just your perception and simply with that you should never start. You need to have an answer for why it is great? is it based on consumer perspective or just based on your hypothesis . This validation which i call a reality check has to be done. So the best way to answer why you want to startup has to come from customer perspective. Any product startup which has an answer for this why? has got lot more chances to succeed and fail less in their pursuit. But how you will know whether your product can get the customers and will be sustainable, well the best way to understand this would be to build the MVP & Simply do a pilot run with few targeted customers and see if they are bragging about your product to others. If your product has that Unique bragging proposition(UBP : A term which Recharge Founder Kunal Shah often use in his talk ) it will be an encouraging sign for you to invest yourself and commit yourself to scale it. Any idea which needs freebies /offers to support its sales is not sustainable and is going to be loss making affair in the long run.\n\nOnce You have build your prototype and have released it for the consumer to experience, do every bit of effort to collect their feedback & improvise your product accordingly. Let your customer decide the evolution of your product be patient, bootstrap as long as possible to be sustainable. At least give yourself min 5 -6 years minimum to build a sustainable business around your product, Yes you need to have this long-term perspective to give yourself any chance to make it Big.\n\nYou will be tested at every stage of your startup building process. It can be really painful while you are trying to compete and pacify your customer & investor, you will fail many a times to attain to the expectations of your team, your customer your investors, your dear ones, you will feel like nothing is working in your favour, every situation and context will try to pull you down and enforce you to give up, in these phases you will be needing your strong grit to stay and support your vision. If you have the required conviction & clarity about your startup vision, all these temporary obstacles will look like a friend to you, all helping you out to carry on with your missions.\n\nIf you have the Grit, you are here to stay long, yes you will be needing others support and luck too, to help you in your journey, but all of these will only work if you complement it with the required Grit & Conviction.\n\nSome of my other articles on startups which maybe of your help\n\nBeing human, there will always be disappointments, there will always be some factors which will not be working as you want it to be, you can\u2019t control the outcome, what best you can control is how you keep yourself in trying situations. How well you take the rejections and your willpower to learn & improve with the time, will make you best in whatever endeavor you choose.\n\nfor more do check out : www.techprenuer.com where i very often share my learning for all you lovely readers .\n\nAlso If you need any guidance in getting your startup product build, feel free to contact at : pramod.pandey@mobibittech.com, I will definitely try to address all your queries personally.\n\nThanks for being there\u2026."

Rich Set Of Libraries : ROR has library named Ruby Gems (a third party library modules) which caters almost all of your programming needs . They are all publicly available and searchable through https://rubygems.org/.\n\n4. Great Active Community To Support : Ruby has larger Community base which is quite active across the borders and very helpful. They constantly organize developer meetup where you can learn , build & debug. The community is full of developers that are constantly improving code, contributing to the open source and helping others on their projects.\n\nRuby on Rails framework is eloquent and succinct language helping developers to build their solution quite swiftly using the rich base of libraries (gems). So Rails offer great tools to develop your product efficiently & enhances productivity to deliver more in less time.\n\n6. Database Migration : ROR is quite flexible & database migration friendly. it can be easily ported to other platforms.\n\n7. Big notch companies are using Rails to build their product technology Stack as shown below, It shows the love & acceptance it has got from some of the biggest technology giants .\n\nEvery programming language has their own limitations & it\u2019s never perfect. Rails has it\u2019s own issue to deal with . It would have been a perfect choice for web developer if it was 2012 , currently it has been facing a tough challenge from NodeJs which has been winning recently of-course NodeJS is also not 100 free from limitations. Lets see some of the Con\u2019s Of Ruby On Rails :\n\nOne of the most talked about issue with ROR has been its runtime speed. It has been reported & tested to be slow as compared NodeJS or GoLang but for the startups and the business who are yet to experience that large scale traffic will hardly notice this shortcomings and ROR is pretty well placed to cater few million people, as it is the case of the Twitter which has been using Rail for sometime now and may be planning to adopt NodeJs lately. But with that scale in place you can afford to migrate technology but to start with it using Rails should can be a better choice as it is good for Rapid Prototyping.\n\nLike most of the existing server side technology Rail supports multithreading. If multiple concurrent connection request pops up it can sometime lead to performance issues due to its blocking I/O nature. In practice, this isn\u2019t too much of a problem as, if you use a library that relies on GIL(Global Interpret Lock), you can switch to multi-process setup but the knock-on effect of this is your application ends up consuming more compute resources than necessary, which can increase your infrastructure costs.\n\n3. Document is not proper for every Gems library : For some of the gems libraries It can be hard to find good documentation. Particularly for the less popular gems and for libraries which make heavy use of mixins . Which sometimes can be frustrating for developers who can save some time if document was there to refer. More often developer use the test suite which act, as documentation for them.\n\n4. Large stack frames. The fact that Rails has so many layers of abstraction make it sometimes difficult to be debugged as much of the flow and structure is hidden for developers to dive into.\n\n5. Boot Speed: One of the most reported issue about Rail is that it takes a lot of time to load due to its heavy framework structure & loads of gems library which one needs to have to code. due to this dependency of libraries and other files it can take a significant amount of time to start, which can be be main roadblock for developers to stick with the platform. specially when NodeJS phases better in term of being lightweight and blazing fast in booting up.\n\n6. ActiveRecord: AR is used heavily within the Ruby on Rails world and is a hard dependency for many of the RubyGems. Although we think it\u2019s a great design pattern, the biggest drawback we see is that your domain becomes tightly coupled to your persistence mechanism. This is far from ideal and can lead to bad architecture decisions.\n\nNow it is time that we analyze NodeJS for its advantages & disadvantages keeping ROR in mind and see why Node is becoming the most popular choice for server side programmer.\n\nFor NodeJS introduction & fundamental understanding about it please refer to my previous articles listed below :\n\nWe will directly go on to cover\n\nWhen it comes to speed NodeJs which has been powered by Google\u2019s V8 script JS engine demonstrates a really high runtime speed giving a much faster coding experiences to the programmers. Ruby is one of the slowest languages when it comes to runtime speed .\n\n2. It\u2019s Very Easy to Learn & Adapt For Programmers:\n\nIf you have been working on Javascript previously, learning NodeJs would not be difficult at all, in-fact if you have a java or c++ background learning Node should not be a daunting task as compared to Rails which is similar to python, having no brackets or semicolons which many C++/Java developers are uncomfortable with.\n\nNode.js can be really handy for developers who wants to build an app using real time data streaming like Youtube Video Streaming app because both HTTP queries and responses are perceived as isolated events but, in fact, they are actually streaming data. Data streaming with Node.js really looks better\n\n4. Lightweight & Fast To boot : NodeJs is quite lightweight as compared to Rails so you will experience speedy file loading while using it.\n\nOne problem with Rails is that changing a filename will crash the server. Suppose there is a controller for \u2018User\u2019 model in your project, Rails will name the controller file as user_controller.rb . Now if you change this filename, Rails will crash. This is because it implicitly imports files by looking up filenames based on its internal logic.\n\nNodeJS on the other hand has no such limitations. You can name your files user_controller.js or userController.js or UC.js or u_controller.js or anything else. NodeJS is cool with it. You just need to require the files wherever you need to use them.\n\nAs we have discussed in my previous article about Node.js that it is Single threaded in its nature of handling multiple connection request. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.\n\nNode.js\u2019 package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.\n\nIf you want to develop a robust & scalable product as a developer or startups where speed is the primary need choose NodeJs. As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.\n\n9. One Language for Both Front-end & Backend :\n\nIf you want to be a full stack developer Learning JS will be easy and will help in adopting Node.js even more quickly to help you code both front-end & back-end of any app or web .\n\n10. Big Players have already adopted It and others are quickly working to migrate :\n\nSome of the Big shot companies are using NodeJs are :\n\nAnd many more \u2026\n\nAs i told no technology or language is perfect and so is the case with Node.js too, let\u2019s analyze what are some of the NodeJs shortcoming :\n\nOne of the major drawback of Node.js is that it is highly inconsistent as far as it\u2019s API is concerned it keeps on frequently changing making it sometime not so stable to use. It may improve as it goes more old with time.\n\nNode.js can lead to serious performance issue if an app requires to perform Image processing or heavy graphics rendering job which requires multiple CPU to function. Because of it\u2019s single threaded processing mechanism of handling events it can\u2019t cater to the large resource demand which can suddenly shoot up against this heavy lifting task. Multithreaded platform like Rails fairs better in this scenario\n\n3. Still New & Growing In Terms Of Community Support Base :\n\nEven though it is catching fast still it is comparatively new and has less community base as compared to old Rail & PHP developer community, but this should not be the concern in coming future seeing the high rate of it\u2019s adoption among the companies and developers. It is easily the most popular choice for new age developers.It is futuristic and more rewarding for programmers and so it is only a matter of time that it will surpass everyone to have the largest network of open source developers supporting it to grow at large scale.\n\nIt is highly recommended to factor in context, need , resources , cost & time before you go on to make decision in choosing the best server side technology for your product. Having said that it is always better to make the choice of your platform which has got the scope to scale and grow with the time. Nodejs has definitely won many hearts in current market dynamics . Also in this age of mobility where there is a need to connect millions of mobile users on apps & webs on the go in real time Nodejs can help you develop better faster & scalable app but if you are developing any solutions where you need heavy lifting job to be done at the processing side you may look for Rails which still has better structure to fulfill this need of yours."

        "title": "How Node.Js Single Thread mechanism Work ? Understanding Event Loop in NodeJs",
        "text": "In our journey of NodeJs so far , we have covered most of the basic of Node.js so it is highly recommended to refer those to set the context right for all you lovely readers:\n\nToday We will explore one of the most prominent feature of Node i.e Event Loop and how Node manages efficiently without multi-threading.\n\nYes! you heard it right, Node is single threaded and it is doing magical things with this model. Some of the popular server side technology like PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby & Java Servers all follow Multi-threaded where each client request results in the instantiation of a new thread or even a process, but Node. js, requests are run on the same thread with even shared resources. All Node JS applications uses \u201cSingle Threaded Event Loop Model\u201d architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients. So Yes NodeJS is single threaded, but this is a half truth, actually it is event-driven and single-threaded with background workers. The main event loop is single-threaded but most of the I/O works run on separate threads, because the I/O APIs in Node.js are asynchronous/non-blocking by design, in order to accommodate the event loop.\n\nNodeJs operate asynchronously and uses the Event-loop mechanism to function let\u2019s look into the code snippet example below\n\nHere when sockets.listen(4000) executes, a Web-Socket server is created on a single thread \u2014 event loop which listens continuously on port 4000. When a web or app client connects to it, it fires the \u2018onConnection\u2019 event which the loop picks up and immediately publishes to the thread pool and is ready to receive the next request and this is the main functionality differentiation between NodeJs based servers and other IIS/ Apache based servers, NodeJs for every connection request do not create a new thread instead it receives all request on single thread and delegates it to be handled by many background workers to do the task as required. Libuv library handles this workers in collaboration with OS kernel. Libuv is the magical library that handles the queueing and processing of asynchronous events utilizing powerful kernel, today most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.\n\nTo better understand we need to get into the details of how event loop works in NodeJs :\n\nAs we have earlier covered that event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operation, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded & by offloads operations to the system kernel whenever possible. lets further get into the details of how event loop functions to clearly understand the Nodejs single threaded concept of handling asynchronous incoming connection requests.\n\nNode has a pool of Thread and you must be scratching your head wondering if Node pushes all those responsibilities down to the kernel then why would a thread pool be needed?\u201d It\u2019s so because the kernel doesn\u2019t support doing everything asynchronously. In those cases Node has to lock a thread for the duration of the operation so it can continue executing the event loop without blocking.\n\nHere is a simplified diagram to explain the mechanical overview of how things run in NodeJs\n\nHere every phase follows FIFO stack like queue mechanism to handle callbacks. Each phase is unique , generally, when the event loop enters a given phase, it will perform any operations specific to that phase, then execute callbacks in that phase\u2019s queue until the queue has been exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has executed. When the queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event loop will move to the next phase, and so on.\n\nWe will cover the Event Loop Phases in details with code snippets in our next articles in our series of NodeJS and also will try to understand the nodejs operations with a practical examples.\n\nI would like to end this article on NodeJs with an amazingly compiled Infographics by Vizteck Solutions where it compares Node with Ruby on Rails.\n\nWe will deeply compare NodeJs With Rail in our upcoming article till then .."

        "text": "Our brain is being controlled by either other people or by the digital media (social media specially ) leaving us to kind of helpless situation where we have surrendered allowing it to control our brain space.So it is quite obvious that nothing worthy can be created when there is no space and time left for you to work on creating any valuable things for yourself. It is time that we declutter ourselves from this garbage and create a breathing space for our intellect to function at its supreme best.\n\nThere is nothing wrong about using social media but letting it control your life is a kind of worrisome. It\u2019s time we take charge of our life in our hand and function in a way where things start happening the way we want. In this information age yes it is pretty difficult to avoid consuming it, but it doesn\u2019t means by any sense that you allow this information to control your brain space and manipulate your thought process. You are being constantly bombarded with false information (not all information are false, but at large most of them are !) and we without any validation make our conclusion based on that info, which is a kind of leading us to all stress and suffering and crippling us to function based on our pure intellect & intelligence.\n\nWe were born with zero information , we knew nothing even we can\u2019t speak. We learned from our surroundings and people around and picked up the language being spoken in our vicinity. We as a child questioned everything and then learnt it gradually. We allowed our brain to function as we wish it to function, when we felt like laughing we laughed , when felt like crying we cried there were limited cognitive filters controlling our emotions and actions. But now when we are growing up in this age of digital revolutions our brain has become dysfunctional and we no longer are in control of it to instruct. Our brain is being instructed by other people or information which we are not in a position to control.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to get back to the old times and learn from the tools which our ancestors and sages has already left for us . If we have to ensure that our brain is functioning as we want, we have to learn to drop whatever garbage we have collected over the period of time and accept that all what we have known till date is just a piece of data which is not the reality. Bring yoga & meditation in to your daily routine and purify yourself . Introspect and inspect what you know and what you don\u2019t know . Questions like a child, validate it with your wisdom and then consume information to the extent you want and be prepared to drop it .\n\nIt is great to be in this age where you have lots of tools and technology to make your life awesome and super efficient, but how we are employing those tools to enhance our life has to be controlled by us. Don\u2019t allow the tools and technology to take charge of your actions instead act in a manner which controls them to function the way you want and live your life your way."

        "text": "For Programmers it is always necessary to keep on experimenting with new technologies and programming tools . As the world is experiencing a huge digital revolution where data is being consumed and generated on the go thanks to the smartphone, we developers specially have the huge ownership & accountability to do justice with all these data and build something incredible for humans. In this connected world where we are exchanging data over the cloud and internet, mobile application has played pivotal role to make information available on its small screen right there to be engaged on will & demand. So as developer we have to keep up with the fast changing technology and learn them quickly to have a rewarding career.\n\nToday we will discuss one such platform which can be a great career opportunity for aspiring software engineer specially who wants to be a mobile app developer. Yes we will talk about Kotlin : A Java based mobile application development platform which Google announced in there Google I/O 2017 as their official programming language to be supported for Android app development using Android Studio.\n\nAs Android, Kotlin also is an open source project under Apache 2.0.\n\nKotlin is a statically-typed language, developed by JetBrains, it is concise while being expressive. It contains safety features for nullability and immutability, to make your Android apps healthy and performant by default.For java developers learning kotlin should not be tough and will be easy to grab in quick time.\n\nBefore we get into developing our first hello kotlin Program lets first covers some kotlin prerequisites needed .\n\nUse the keyword to create a class in kotlin.\n\nLet create a Ball Class as shown below :\n\nA class blueprint generally comprises of properties and member functions which we call a Method.\n\nLet\u2019s understand this by adding properties to the class, name of type and radius of type .\n\nas it can be seen in above code snippet, the procedure to create a variable is somewhat different from what we do in java, here you must use the keyword. However, if you want your variable to be a read-only/assign-once variable, use the keyword instead.\n\nAs kotlin is a null safe , it makes distinction between variables that can be and variables that can never be .\n\nTo create a variable that can hold , one need to add a after the variable\u2019s type.\n\nOnce we have a class , we can instantiate our Ball Class as shown below\n\nAs you can see we don\u2019t instantiate our class like we do in java using new keyword. Kotlin doesn\u2019t have the keyword. Once the instance has been created, you can access its properties the same way you would in Java:\n\nInitializing the individual properties of our instance the way we just did in our example code snippet above is not a great way to do it, more efficient way is to use constructor. Kotlin\u2019s syntax to create such a constructor is very compact as shown below :\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t want to add anything in your class blueprint we can also use constructor as shown below :\n\nAs shown above the constructor, which is part of the class\u2019s header, is called the primary constructor.\n\nBut it you want to add custom values and more more constructors to your class, called secondary constructors, one should use the keyword. Secondary constructors should delegate to the primary constructor using the keyword.\n\nLet\u2019s see how to add secondary constructor to our class that initializes the value of a property named shape:\n\nTo create an instance using the secondary constructor, you write something like this:\n\nInorder to create functions in Kotlin keyword is used .\n\nFunctions in Kotlin are declared using the fun keyword:\n\nFunction parameters are defined using Pascal notation, i.e. name: type. Parameters are separated using commas. Each parameter must be explicitly typed:\n\nIn Kotlin one can extend a class by adding an additional functions, there is no need to modify the origin modifying its original definition. Such functions are known as extensions. The names of these functions should be preceded by the names of the classes they extend.\n\nFor example, to add an extension called isRed to the class, you write the following code outside the class:\n\n// if value is code is 1 return code red\n\nThis feature is especially useful when you want to extend classes that do not belong to your project\u2019s code base.\n\nIn-order to create a derived class we need to make sure\n\nIn Kotlin, you have to explicitly state that a member function can be overridden by using the annotation in the method\u2019s header in the base class. In the derived class, open functions can be overriden using the annotation.\n\nFor example, to override the method, you add the following code snippet to the class:\n\nIn Kotlin you can\u2019t directly create static methods, but, it does allow you to create package level functions that do not belong to any class.\n\nThe method is perhaps the best known static method. If you want to add the method to a package named com.mobibit.blog.kotlin, then your code would look like this:\n\nWe have already covered few function basics in class section above which is quite similar to java. Kotlin gives you more liberty to play with while using function.\n\nWhen a function returns a single expression, the curly braces can be omitted and the body is specified after a = symbol:\n\nIf our Ball class has to return the diameter value the method would be\n\nAs you can see, this shorthand syntax is more compact and readable.\n\nExplicitly declaring the return type is optional when this can be inferred by the compiler:\n\nFunctions with block body must always specify return types explicitly, unless it\u2019s intended for them to return , in which case it is optional. Kotlin does not infer return types for functions with block bodies .\n\nA member function is a function that is defined inside a class or object:\n\nFunctions can have generic parameters which are specified using angle brackets before the function name:\n\nHigher order functions are functions that can return functions or accept functions as parameters. A lambda expression, on the other hand, is just a function that has no name. Usually, lambda expressions and higher order functions are used together.\n\nConsider the following example that demonstrates the syntax of a lambda expression:\n\nA good example of high order function is that takes a lock object and a function, acquires the lock, runs the function and releases the lock :\n\nA lambda expression or an anonymous function is a \u201cfunction literal\u201d, i.e. a function that is not declared, but passed immediately as an expression. Consider the following example:(kotlin.org)\n\nFunction is a higher-order function, i.e. it takes a function value as the second argument. This second argument is an expression that is itself a function, i.e. a function literal. As a function, it is equivalent to:\n\nTo create a range in kotlin, we need a operator.\n\n// This range contains the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nTo create a range in descending order, use the function instead.\n\n// This range contains the number 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the step to be 1, you can specify a custom value using the function.\n\n// This range contains the number 5, 3, 1\n\nIf expression is usually used to return a value based on the condition being satisfied, so there is no ternary operator (condition ? then : else)\n\nif branches can be blocks, and the last expression is the value of a block:\n\nAs you must be familiar with Java\u2019s expression is equivalent to it, but the best part is that it much more versatile to use.\n\nwhen replaces the switch operator of C-like languages. In the simplest form it looks like this\n\ncan not only take single values but also expressions as its conditions.\n\nIn Kotlin, you can use the loop to loop through arrays, collections, and anything else that provides an iterator which is quite similar to Java, except for the use of the operator instead of Java\u2019s operator.\n\nThe body can be a block.\n\nWith the help of range expressions, you can make this loop behave like a traditional, C-style, loop.\n\nwhile loop works as it works in java as shown below\n\nprintln(\"My name is ${strname}\") // Prints \"My name is pram\"\n\nHere we tried to covers the basics of Kotlin language to become somewhat familiar with whats Kotlin has to offer , even though we have just touched a small portion of it in this series of Kotlin Tutorilas.\n\nAlso do read : Android Developers Have You Switched To Kotlin Yet ? to understand why we need to adopt kotlin, as google has adopted it as their official android language.\n\nWe will cover Getting started with android using kotlin in our next article in this series."

        "title": "Role of Spirituality in Entrepreneurs Life ! \u2013",
        "text": "Being spiritual in a business can be something which may not align well with your personal ambitions and may not resonate to many of us. It is very uncommon things to discuss spirituality in the startup ecosystem, entrepreneurship and business community.\n\nLet\u2019s touch spirituality first and then discuss in what way it can help us to shape and orient ourselves for the services of others and eventually reaching to our business goals as entrepreneurs.\n\nAs we can understand from above statement, it is really important that we take charge of our life in such a manner that everything we do just breaks the boundaries which limits us . As an entrepreneur we have to be fully alive to all what is happening around us, and to enhance our perception to an extent where everything seems lovable and possible irrespective of the outcome it is needed for us to first understand ourself truly. Spirituality helps us to be in full control of our mind body and emotions thereby helping us to conduct ourselves in our day 2 day life in more blissful manner. Yes there will be problems as not all things are under our control and there will be moments of stress & anxiety but we can easily manage to face it and come out of it if we have explored the inner dimensions of our existence as a human body.\n\nwith sharp knife of knowledge and beliefs, instead it helps us to see things \u201cAs It Is \u201d. It helps us to act more and think less, it teaches us not to be belief but to experience everything. With this true understanding of life we entrepreneur breed can break all physical boundaries which creates fear and agony of trying, it will help us to have clarity & conviction to make decisions which never differentiates but teaches us to be inclusive in our approach towards anything we do.\n\nWhen you drop all the boundaries and accept the fact that we know nothing , we start the journey to explore the things and experience it fully, this dimension to life also help us to lead from front. We treat the people around us more as a human and try to help them flourish without being judgemental. We include all our team members in our decision making and consider them as one. With enhanced perception to see life , we start seeing everyone involved as one being and act collaboratively to achieve the desired goal.\n\nSpirituality teaches us to act without being identified with anything.\n\nTherefore i always say :\n\nSo to be truly growing and seeing your business flourish you first need to understand the fact that you are nothing more than the actor. Our identity is the main reason we are unsecure and always act with a sense of fear . Once we stop identifying ourselves with things we will be able to get what we want and also will be in a position to truly relish it.\n\nSo entrepreneurs need to act without attaching themselves to its outcome. We need to be fearless and always perform to serve . We need to master our own emotions which are our real enemy in our road to success and drop our labels which puts all kind of boundaries around us.\n\nBut to act in this manner we need to first learn to free ourselves from all kinds of false belief systems and knowledge. We need to read our body\u2019s user manual to help it function to its fullest dimension and to do so we need to be a seeker first. Let\u2019s learn us together to simply sit and see our true existence with our own eye internally.\n\nLet\u2019s make it a part of our daily routine and see the new you blossom and flourish to its infinite potential."

But before that you need to do your homework right, here are few tips for the same :\n\nPricing the development effort is always tricky and challenging as it depend on time, place and people/company involved. Cost vary if you engage any freelancer, or offshore it or hire a professional agency like us, some of the factors which decides the product development pricing\n\nOnce we have given a thought on all possible factors it is time to understand the cost involved ? Let me make it easy for your understanding based on my own experience of 11+ years into this domain of mobility as bullet point :\n\nAs per Business of App : An average benchmarks for app development project costs based on type and complexity are:\n\nCost to a company who hires mobile developer to develop a product for you has been posted below by indeed.com.\n\nMobile App Developer annual salary in 2017, by country, in USD, in thousands\n\nAs you can see from above stats your chances of getting your mobile app development done economically lies purely from which location you are getting it done.\n\nSo it all comes down to the no of resources involved , type of company or freelancers involved and , project needs and complexity. But the deciding factor is you yourself. You must need to put your research and homework and have some planned budget before you go on to hire an expert to do the job for you. Yes market have lot of research and data in place for you to dig deeper before you decide upon. But essentially it is matter of time & patience as the context and needs changes and so you have to be flexible in your approach and work in phases to handle the complexity which pops up now and then."

        "text": "In my Node.js series of articles so far i have covered basics and some stats to put things in perspective for you about why Node.js is becoming an important career options for aspiring programmers.\n\nToday we will learn how to write your first program using Node.js. We will cover this journey in following steps\n\n4. An Example To conclude\n\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome\u2019s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.\n\nFor more refer to my article :\n\n1. All About Node.Js You Wanted To Know ?\n\nYou need to follow these simple steps\n\nIf you need add more Node.js version you should use nvm: Node Version Manager . Choose your nvm based on your machine os.\n\nTo verify that you have Node.js up and running, run this:\n\nIf everything is ok, it will return the version number of the currently active Node.js binary.\n\nIf you are working on a project supporting Node.js v4, you can start using it with the following command:\n\nThen you can switch to Node.js v5 with the very same command:\n\nIn Node.js the stable versions with long-term support (LTS) are the ones starting with even numbers (4, 6, 8 \u2026) and the experimental version are the odd numbers (5, 7 \u2026). It is recommend you to use the LTS version in production and try out new things with the experimental one.\n\nNPM helps javascript developers load dependencies effectively. To load dependencies we just have to run a command in command prompt:\n\nThis command is finding a json file named as in root directory to install all dependencies defined in the file.\n\nThe most important things in your package.json are name and version. Those are actually required, and your package won\u2019t install without them. The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be completely unique. Changes to the package should come along with changes to the version.\n\nSome default script values are based on package contents.\n\nIf there is a server.js file in the root of your package, then npm will default the start command to node server.js.\n\nDependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a version range. Version Name must be Version exactly.\n\nLet\u2019s go through this steps by an example :\n\nAs we need to create an http server we use and pass it to a variable named\n\nWe also need to defined hostname and port number, here we use i.e and number 3000(it can vary based on your preferences) and assign this to the variables and , respectively.\n\nNext we create the http server using the method.\n\nThis created the server as well as a response having , header of plain text and and ends with the string . This is the response that the server can send to browser.\n\nthe function has two parameters and which is the from and to the server, respectively.\n\nAs we created the server above , now it\u2019s time to assign it a hostname and port number.\n\nHere, the server listens to localhost on port 3000 and prints \u201cServer running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ \u201c in command prompt.\n\nNow Run server.js file using command shown below\n\nType url http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in the browser, to display Hello World string as shown on the screen below :\n\nAs always after some code basics let me give some facts of Node.js to help you understand why Node.js becoming so popular among corporates and developer community and why you should think about getting into it.\n\nWe covered the basic of getting started with Node.js for novice programmers who are looking to venture into Node.js programming. In our next in the series we will dive deep into Node.js covering a comprehensive project to grab the concept practically."

        "text": "As our life revolves around work and we spend lot of our time in a workplace where you get the opportunity to learn and earn, so it becomes really important that we take responsibility to create such an environment around us where we attain our highest possibility of delivering our task with greater accountability and integrity. Having said that it also becomes relevant for the leaders/owners of the business or workplace to actively participate with their peers and be invested with them to give a platform where everyone can be at their best and delegate their task without the cloud of doubt and fear.\n\nA great workplace endorses an inclusive environment. Everyone feels an important part of the common vision which they are working towards. Leaders make sure they are listening to everyones viewpoint while making their work strategy and delegating the responsibility with utter clarity.\n\nIf you are complimented for your effort you feel inspired and happy. Great organization create a culture which rewards your efforts and makes you feel special. Leaders of an organization makes sure that they are providing right kind of training and learning environment to further hone their team member skills and prepare them for future. If an organization prepares their team team for the future opportunity and keep them updated , it will grow right and will scale for sure.\n\nAwesome workplace is free of chaos, people involved are well communicated about their works and responsibilities. Also it encourages transparency where everyone is well informed about the expectations and challenges of an organization. Great workplaces endorses a constructive feedback system where everyone is heard and feels engaged in the process of achieving short-term and long term goals.\n\nLeaders Collaborate with everyone and make sure task is done with the right intent & spirit. Great organization fosters a culture where everyone participate and collaborate to share both success and failure together. They encourage team members to accept each other for both their strength and weakness, leading to a strong binding among each others.\n\nAn organization with a culture of equanimity and respect for each others as an individual fosters great work environment. Workplace should be a place where everyone feels important and motivated enough to exercise their work irrespective of their skills or gender.\n\nIdeal workplace encourages people to delegate their task fearlessly & in a stress-free manner. Any workplace where leaders & decision makers tells their team players to go out and perform and back them irrespective of the outcome is bound to grow . Everyone likes to work in an environment full of opportunity & challenges and if they know that while they are battling it out to reach the desired goals, they have the leadership backing and confidence, they will perform at their full potential."

        "text": "Speaking my heart out, no filter, no brainer !\n\nIn my small entrepreneurial journey I have experienced that most of the time the act which I perform is very unreal to me. I can bet most of you must be feeling the same, but never speak up because of certain limitation which we have imposed for ourselves. But the matter of fact is that we are living very animated life which has no place for true emotions. Everyone around is just trying to take undue advantage of each other with some hidden selfish motive to satisfy their ego.\n\nWhat if we can be real? No, I can\u2019t accept this argument that the world is so and so you should behave, world is nothing more than an individual perception, it is us who are the real creator of the not so real world . It is the hard reality, but we all are ignorant to the truth of our being. We were never born to fight, to lie, to kill each other for the sake of short term monetary benefit, which is just a shitty piece of paper with numbers & not everything, but see it has become more valuable than the breathing life itself.\n\nThe bigger question for the entire humanity is, Why it is so hard to be true?Why it so hard to act out of sheer love than force? Why it is so difficult to put others first than being self- centric? Most of our act is driven by the single motive to accumulate more luxury so that life becomes super easy and safe to live. Luxury is becoming a sole motive for most of the people on this earth. They are blindly exploiting each other to snatch every bit of penny from each others pocket. They fear being poor, having no money in this age is like a suicide. This status quo is all everyone is longing for. No, I don\u2019t mean to say that it is bad to be rich, what I mean to say is, that -\n\nWe are not willing to act honestly because it may lead to some disappointments to others, We being honest is a threat to others, we are more living in a fear, where we fear more what others will feel and think if we go wrong in our deeds we may be called a misfit in the society which is not at all true. This fear of failure is killing us in our virtual mind which is so far from being true. We are living so materialistically that our eyes are blind-folded to reality. Whatever comes across to us, we want to make it ours. It is this urge to have it all is stopping us to see the things as it exists. The most valueless things are a value to us. Love & happiness has become more like an extinct species which everyone is trying to feel and preserve fearing they may lose it. So they always try to escape from being alive.\n\nIf we can simply exist as we are and are willing enough to face our true existence, we will always act to seek and learn more from all the failures. We will have all the luxuries but never value it more than human life. If we can walk the path of a true seeker, we will always live in a moment of bliss and never try to demean any people or situation. Being true to our feelings and respecting it will help you do the same to others and we can coexist happily with each other. We grew up being social now we need to maintain it. We have to accept the fact that we are nothing if we are not helping and serving each other.\n\nSo accept your reality and face the fact that you are nothing more than a tiny speck in this vast universe. You coexist with earth, tree & all other living and nonliving creature and everyone in this universe has a role to play. Nobody is superior instead everyone needs to delegate their duty to supreme efficiency so as to allow this universe to function smoothly and flourish, else we will be living so dangerously that we can extinct more faster than any other creature living in this creation.\n\nFor more, do check out: www.techprenuer.com where i very often share my learning for all you awesome readers."

        "text": "Lot of youth aspires to be a most sought after software developer and so goes on to learn the required programming skills to match to the current market and industrial needs. They have broadly two choices to make\n\nFront-end development covers coding the UI interface, handling events and interacting with back-end server to pull the data on the front-end UI side. Front-end is where user engages with the app and perform activities\n\nDeveloper who are seeking careers in front-end side mainly needs to master\n\nBack-end mainly deals with the technical stuff which is not visible to the end user. It mainly deals with server side scripting and data base interaction so that front-end apps can request for the required data to be populated in the front-end mobile /web/desktop app.\n\nToday We will cover Node.js which is the most sought after backend scripting language in the current technology market and is becoming the preferred language options for back-end programmers.\n\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome\u2019s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. npm is a Node.js package of open source library which is largest in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications.It can handle many concurrent connections at a time, where when connection request are made concurrently for each connection a callback is fired .If there is no task to be performed Node will go to sleep.\n\nNode.js connection handling mechanism is super efficient than our existing classical thread based model Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.\n\nNode.js was first conceived in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and was developed and maintained by Ryan which then got sponsored and supported by Joyent. Dahl was not happy the way Apache Http server used to handle the lot of concurrent connections and the way code was being created which either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections. This lead him to create a Node.js project which he went on to demonstrate at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. He used Google Google\u2019s V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API in his project which won lon of hearts and standing ovation.\n\nIn June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.In January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project.In December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to the internal conflict over Joyent\u2019s governance, In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities decided to work together under the Node.js Foundation.\n\nNode JS Platform does not follow Request/Response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model. It follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly based on Javascript Event based model with Javascript callback mechanism.\n\nNode.js comprises of two main component core & its modules. Core: it\u2019s built in C & C++. It combines Google V8 JS engine with Node\u2019s Libuv library and protocol bindings including sockets & Http.\n\nis explained in the attached Pdf below : Presented by Appdynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s an open sourceJIT(Just In Time) compiler written in c++ which has outperformed PHP, Ruby and python performance wise. V8 compiles Javascript directly into assembly level code. V8 Runtime environment comprises into 3 major component\n\nThis library handles Node\u2019s asynchronous I/O operation and main event loop. There are thread pool reserve in Libuv which handles the thread allocation to individual I/O operations.\n\nare a list of objects available for a specific task. Node relies heavily on Object Pool design pattern to which is a centrally memory management system.\n\nFacade provides interface to the body of the code like class library. In Node Libuv act as that facade around smaller libraries like Libev and Libio.\n\nIt\u2019s an official open source package manager for Node written purely in Javascript.\n\nBut before that lets understand Node.js importance by this Infographics coined by Engine Yard :\n\nFollowing are some of the prominent highlights that make Node.js the first choice of software developers specially backend.\n\nAll APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.\n\nBeing built on Google Chrome\u2019s V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js is super efficient and quick in code execution.\n\nNode.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers like Apache which create limited threads to handle requests.\n\nNode.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.\n\nBecause of above specifications some of the biggies like eBay, Paypal, Godaddy, General electronic , Yahoo etc.. relies on Node for their server side programming needs.\n\nIt is being employed in\n\nWe will try to build and run our first small code using node.js features to understand why it is the darling of the modern day programmer in our next article in the NodeJS series..\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget to read one of my most loved article on Nodejs :\n\nIf you are \ud83d\udc9a \ud83d\udc9a my contribution do \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f clap , Click Here and subscribe to reach out to me for more and i would feel blessed to hear and respond you back."

        "text": "Being emotionally competent, being emotionally intelligent or being emotionally literate become really important specially when we are living in a world which is so diverse and full of intellectual brains around having different level of expectations, IQ\u2019s & EQ\u2019s . How to stand out, how to sustain and survive is all what is at stake specially in corporate professional workplaces.\n\nSo today we will try to understand what are those emotional skills which we need to develop and master so that we not only stand out but stand strong and help others to grow inclusively. Lets first define :\n\nEmotional competence has two major sides to it , one deals with\n\nintrapersonal (inside, self) and other deals with interpersonal (relationships). To understand how it works , lets understand Emotional competence framework as a whole which puts light on Emotional Competence in an elaborate manner.\n\nBut Before we venture into emotional competence framework, it is necessary to understand what is emotional intelligence :\n\nBased on the studies of Goleman (1995 and 1998) and Boyatzis (1982),We can say\n\nAs Goleman suggested this framework has two major component\n\nIt empowers individuals with a skills which helps them to be competitive at their workplace or in a society. As per Goleman these competencies comprises of\n\nPeople with high level of self-awareness are great at managing their emotions. They understand themselves fully and are great in understanding their goods and bad feelings. They are confident in whatever task they delegate and also ensures that they showcase right amount of emotions to fit into the workplace or situations they are put into.\n\nGoleman further summarizes Self-awareness into these 3 competencies :\n\nThis aspect keeps a check and balance on the individuals emotions and helps them to approach with a balanced mindset while expressing it. People with this skillset have a controlled aggression and present a right kind of their individualistic traits . In trying situations it gives them strength to control their impulses and saving them from unwanted stress.\n\nGoleman further breaks this self-regulation aspect into :\n\nThese breed of people puts high standards for themselves and strive to excels in whatever field they engage in. They are self motivated and take inspirations from the people who have excelled in their respective fields . For them results matters the most not the outcome. They are certain in their goals and leaves no stones unturned to meet them.\n\nIn social dynamics our real test of character and emotional abilities are put to test. It can be your workplace, social gathering, home or events for that matter. Her how well you gel-up with others depends upon your social competence. These emotional intelligence aspect needs you to respect others feeling and manage your response according to it. So eventually this aspect has to do more with managing others .\n\nGoleman has categorized social competence into two major component\n\nThis social trait is further classified by goleman as :\n\nSo if you want to excel in your work and at your workplace you not only need to have cognitive skills but also these emotional competence. Decision maker in any corporate in most of the survey has communicated this fact that the people who depict strong emotional intelligence are the one\u2019s who are standing out and performing at their peek level. They are the real champion as they foster great team work and are ensure that the task is well communicated and done in good faith.\n\nWould like to thanks Daniel Goleman to inspire me & giving me right perspective to pen down this article. His Book emotional intelligence has all what one needs to learn to be a start performer. Go get it, read it and see the change be the change ."

        "title": "A Guide To NLP Implementation Using OpenNLP : Making Machines Speak",
        "text": "NLP : Natural Language Processing is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which enables computers to analyze and understand the human language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) was formulated to build software that generates and understand natural languages so that a user can have natural conversations with his computer. NLP combines AI with computational linguistics and computer science to process human or natural languages and speech.\n\nTo Understand NLP Fundamentals please refer my other articles\n\nLet\u2019s understand how to implement NLP using Open Source Java Library called OpenNLP.\n\nThe Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. OpenNLP library supprts\n\nThis OpenSource Java library comes loaded with following features for the developers to take advantage of and build robust Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning based solution for modern computer. Some of the prominent features of this library are\n\nA. Named Entity Recognition (NER) \u2212 Open NLP supports NER, helping developers to separate names of location, people and things while dynamically query processing.\n\nB. Summarize \u2212 It helps in summarizing paragraphs, articles, documents or their collection in Natural Language Processing\n\nIn OpenNLP, a given search string or its synonyms can be identified in given text, even though the given word is altered or misspelled.\n\nD. Tagging (POS) \u2212 Tagging in NLP is used to divide the text into various grammatical elements for further analysis.\n\nE. Translation \u2212 In NLP, Translation helps in translating one language into another.\n\nF. Information grouping \u2212 This option in NLP groups the textual information in the content of the document, just like Parts of speech.\n\nG. Natural Language Generation \u2212 It is used for generating information from a database and automating the information reports such as weather analysis or medical reports.\n\nH. Feedback Analysis \u2212 As the name implies, various types of feedbacks from people are collected, regarding the products, by NLP to analyze how well the product is successful in winning their hearts.\n\nI. Speech recognition \u2212 Though it is difficult to analyze human speech, NLP has some builtin features for this requirement.\n\nOpenNLP library classes and interfaces helps developers to implement various task which it offers like sentence detection, tokenization, name extraction etc.. as mentioned above. We can also train & evaluate our own models for any of these tasks using OpenNLP CLI(Command Line Interface)\n\nLets understand how to use Apche OpenNLP in :\n\nFirst We need to see the OpenNLP Installation process;\n\nStep 1 \u2212 Types https://opennlp.apache.org/. and go to the home page of Apache OpenNLP. There you will see an option to download OpenNLP library\n\nStep 2 \u2212 On clicking download you will find various mirrors which will redirect you to the Apache Software Foundation Distribution directory.\n\nStep 3 \u2212 download various Apache distributions. Browse through them and find the OpenNLP distribution and click it.\n\nStep 4 \u2212 On clicking, you will be redirected to the directory where you can see the index of the OpenNLP distribution, as shown below.\n\nClick on the latest version from the available distributions.\n\nStep 5 \u2212 Each distribution provides Source and Binary files of OpenNLP library in various formats. Download the source and binary files, apache-opennlp-1.6.0-bin.zip and apache-opennlp1.6.0-src.zip (for Windows).\n\nAfter downloading the OpenNLP library, you need to set its path to the bindirectory. Assume that you have downloaded the OpenNLP library to the E drive of your system.\n\nNow, follow the steps that are given below \u2212\n\nStep 2 \u2212 Click on the \u2018Environment Variables\u2019 button under the \u2018Advanced\u2019 tab.\n\nStep 3 \u2212 Select the path variable and click the Edit button, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nStep 4 \u2212 In the Edit Environment Variable window, click the New button and add the path for OpenNLP directory E:\\apache-opennlp-1.6.0\\bin and click the OK button, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nYou can set the Eclipse environment for OpenNLP library, either by setting the Build path to the JAR files or by using pom.xml.\n\nFollow the steps given below to install OpenNLP in Eclipse \u2212\n\nStep 1 \u2212 Make sure that you have Eclipse environment installed in your system.\n\nStep 2 \u2212 Open Eclipse. Click File \u2192 New \u2192 Open a new project, as shown below.\n\nStep 3 \u2212 You will get the New Project wizard. In this wizard, select Java project and proceed by clicking the Next button.\n\nStep 4 \u2212 Next, you will get the New Java Project wizard. Here, you need to create a new project and click the Next button, as shown below.\n\nStep 5 \u2212 After creating a new project, right-click on it, select Build Path and click Configure Build Path.\n\nStep 6 \u2212 Next, you will get the Java Build Path wizard. Here, click the Add External JARs button, as shown below.\n\nStep 7 \u2212 Select the jar files opennlp-tools-1.6.0.jar and opennlp-uima-1.6.0.jar located in the lib folder of apache-opennlp-1.6.0 folder.\n\nOn clicking the Open button in the above screen, the selected files will be added to your library.\n\nOn clicking OK, you will successfully add the required JAR files to the current project and you can verify these added libraries by expanding the Referenced Libraries, as shown below.\n\nConvert the project into a Maven project and add the following code to its pom.xml.\n\nOnce Installation is done now it\u2019s time to get our hands dirty with some coding stuffs.\n\nThe Sentence Detector in OpenNLP functions by detecting the whether punctuation character at the end of the sentence marks the end of it or not. Here sentence is defined as the longest white space trimmed character sequence between two punctuation marks. The first and last sentence make an exception to this rule. The first non whitespace character is assumed to be the begin of a sentence, and the last non whitespace character is assumed to be a sentence end.\n\nThe sample text below (Source : opennlp.apache.org) should be segmented into its sentences.\n\nAfter detecting the sentence boundaries each sentence is written in its own line.\n\nUsually Sentence Detection is done before the text is tokenized and that\u2019s the way the pre-trained models on the web site are trained, but it is also possible to perform tokenization first and let the Sentence Detector process the already tokenized text.\n\nIn-order to integrate Sentence Detector in our apps we can use its API, which requires to load the Sentence Detector model and instantiate Sentence Detector as shown below :\n\nonce mode is successfully load as shown in the code snippet above\n\nWe need to instantiate SentenceDetectorME as shown below :\n\nThe Sentence Detector can output an array of Strings, where each String is one sentence.\n\nThe result array now contains two entries. The first String is \u201cFirst sentence.\u201d and the second String is \u201cSecond sentence.\u201d The whitespace before, between and after the input String is removed.\n\nWe can also use an API to get the span of the given sentence in any input data string as shown below :\n\nThe result array again contains two entries. The first span beings at index 2 and ends at 17. The second span begins at 18 and ends at 34. The utility method Span.getCoveredText can be used to create a substring which only covers the chars in the span.\n\nOpenNLP training API trains the sentence mode using 3 basic steps mentioned below\n\nThe following sample code illustrates these steps:\n\nLets understand how to train and test sentence detector by a sample code using Apache OpenNLP. This code snippets has been taken from denismigol.com :\n\nWhich explain the generation of training text method, train method, test text and test method.\n\nIt will produce the following output:\n\nOpenNLP can be included in a project as maven dependency. Sample pom.xml:\n\nFor more details refers this tutorials :\n\nReference books : To learn more of OpenNLP :\n\nSigning-off with a wonderful though which i cam across while penning down this article :\n\nIn our next in the series of NLP using OpenNLP we will cover basics of Tokenization .\n\nIf you are loving my contribution please Click Here and subscribe to reach out to me for more and i would feel blessed to hear and respond you back."

        "title": "A Guide To NLP : A Confluence Of AI And Linguistics",
        "text": "We are living our lives more in bits & bytes than in exchanging emotions. We transact and communicate more over the internet using our super intelligent machines called computer. So we now feel that our machines need to understand how we comprehend while we speak and are trying to give language to them using the filed of Artificial Intelligence Called NLP : Natural Language Processing. Chatbots as an outcome are are becoming a reliable business tools to communicate with humans using this non-human dependent intelligent tool.\n\nIt\u2019s a confluence of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics which handles interactions between machines and natural languages of humans in which computers are entailed to analyze, understand, alter, or generate natural language. NLP helps computer machines to engage in communication using natural human language in all forms, including but not limited to speech, print, writing, and signing.\n\nNLP Machine Learning & Deep Learning : How Are They Connected :\n\nNLP is closely related to ML and Deep Learning all these are branched out as shown in image below from Artificial Intelligence : A field of computer science which engages in making machine intelligent. Deep Learning is one of the popular Machine Learning techniques like Regression, K-means etc..\n\nMachine Learning type like unsupervised ML is often used in NLP techniques like LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is a Topic Modeling Algorithm)\n\nIn-order to perform any NLP we need to deeply understand emotional and analytical aspect of how human being process language. Also various data sources of language like social media where human share the content which directly or indirectly is an extension what they are feeling has to be intelligently analysed by machines using NLP. NLP machines need to build a human reasoning system and with the help of ML techniques they can automate NLP process and scale it.\n\nJohn Rehling, an NLP expert at Meltwater Group, said in How Natural Language Processing Helps Uncover Social Media Sentiment.\n\nIt become really relevant to understand how NLP works so that it becomes easy to grasp the NLP as a whole . Generally NLP has got two main components\n\nAt the start computer gets an input of natural language ( natural language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing.)\n\nComputer then converts them into Artificial language like speech recognition and or speech to text conversion works. Here we get the data into a textual form which NLU process to understand the meaning of the same.\n\nIt is a statistical speech recognition model which converts your speech into a text with the help of prebuilt mathematical techniques and try to infer what you said verbally.\n\nIt tries to understand what you said by taking the voice data and breaking it down to small chunk of particular time duration mostly 10\u201320 ms. These data sets are further compared to pre-fed speech to decode what you said in each unit of your speech. The purpose here is to find phoneme(a smallest unit of speech). Then machine looks at the series of such phonemes and statistically determine the most likely words and sentences to spoke.\n\nThen NLU gets to deeply understand each word where it tries to understand whether it is a Noun or Verb, what is the tense(Past or future) and so on.. This process is defined as POS : Part Of Speech Tagging. NLP has inbuilt lexicon and a set of protocols related to grammar pre-coded into their system which is employed while processing the set of natural language data sets and decode what was said when NLP system processed the human speech.\n\nNLP systems also have a lexicon (a vocabulary) and a set of grammar rules coded into the system. Modern NLP algorithms use statistical machine learning to apply these rules to the natural language and determine the most likely meaning behind what was said. There are several challenges in accomplishing this when considering problems such as words having several meanings (polysemy) or different words having similar meanings (synonymy), but software developers builds their own rules in their NLU systems which can handle this type of problems with proper training and learning\n\nA compared to stage one NLU which does most of hard work on their part to understand what humans have said , NLG has quite an easier job to translates that artificial language of a computers to generate a meaningful text which can further be converted to audible speech using tex-to-speech conversion. The text-to-speech engine analyzes the text using a prosody model, which determines breaks, duration, and pitch. Then, using a speech database, the engine puts together all the recorded phonemes to form one coherent string of speech.\n\nIn a nutshell NLP employs NLU & NLG components to process the human natural language specially in speech recognition field and try to understand , decode and infer what was said by delivering string or audible speech as an output.\n\nIn this computer age of digital revolution where most of the tasks are being accomplished by humans using machines which are internet connected.NLP has played a vital role in building some robust software tools for industry segments like media, publishing, advertising, healthcare, banking and insurance, helping them to operate efficiently and productively.\n\nMost of you must be quite familiar with spams. Being a Gmail user you can Relate spam filtering techniques. Google uses this AI based NLP techniques to keep your inbox clean and spam free. Spam filters have become important as the first line of defense against our ever-increasing problem of unwanted email. A technology that has received much attention is Bayesian spam filtering, a statistical technique in which the incidence of words in an email is measured against its typical occurrence in a corpus of spam and non-spam emails.\n\nNLP is increasingly being used for machine translation programs, in which one human language is automatically translated into another human language. Google is a pioneer in this which translates your text in one language into the text of the desired language.\n\nIt is used in separating one item from the set of given item which are of similar nature and attribute. Examples include first and last names, age, geographic locations, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, company names, etc. Named entity extraction, sometimes also called named entity recognition, makes it easier to mine data.\n\nNatural language processing can be used to produce a readable summary from a large chunk of text. For example, one might us automatic summarization to produce a short summary of a dense academic article.\n\n6. Speech Recognition : Text-To-Speech Conversion etc as spoke at the start of the articles. Is what NLP is being extensively used for.\n\nsome other utilities of NLP are Sentiment analysis which is used in Algorithmic Stock trading etc..\n\nNext in our series of NLP articles, we will go ever more deeper into technicalities of NLP keeping software developer who wants to pursue their career into this AI & ML field of computer science.

        "title": "Leaders Are You Listening Enough To Communicate It Right ?",
        "text": "In our ancient scriptures and Vedas the first word of supreme importance is \u201cShruti\u201d means listening. You have to listen this Vedas from the master who have the deep understanding of it before you can gain that knowledge yourself. So if you want to understand those knowledge bank you have to be a shrota(listener) first. The Vedic view with vibrations , follows a logical cause and effect : whatever you listen to, you will think about; whatever you think about ; you will speak about; whatever you speak about, you will do; and whatever you do; you will become. For this reason good listening skills are inseparable companion to creating healing vibrations of higher consciousness.\n\nIn-short what you eat creates your energy and life force, which then becomes your mind . Let\u2019s understand how relevant our vedic teachings have been with an example . In our school if we have to learn any subject we rely on our master who specializes in that subject , we have to listen attentively while he is speaking with ears wide open to gain from his knowledge book. We practically learn more when we are listening to someone else instead to burying your head into the text books.\n\nConsider Pravachan(Vedic Lectures), the popular lectures given by teachers who have personally experienced the truths they are explaining. In these dynamic discourses, the teacher presents the essentials of the Vedas, Upanishads and other scriptures, and those who listen absorb those deep teachings with all of their senses from one who knows. In this sharing, this speaking and hearing, subtle knowledge is transmitted from knower to seeker in a way that cannot be matched by reading. Multiple levels of information are conveyed through such speech \u2014 inflection, emotion, emphasis, conviction and subtle intimations.\n\nIn today\u2019s so called advanced and progressive world , There is a stiff competition to be at the top of the ladder specially in corporate job with big fat salary and there are lot of articles floating teaching you how to be a leader, what they are not focusing is the secret sauce which are already hidden in our old school teachings.Vedas taught us first to be an effective listener and when you have mastered that everything else falls into place in terms of effective leadership .\n\nSo an effective leader has to be an effective listener who whenever finds any saints , or anyone who is a sea of knowledge, sit\u2019s back with a blank mind , without bringing any ego or knowledge whatsoever in between and try to drink and sink in every bit of teaching being delivered , by the masters. They sit with an open mindset of gaining and that\u2019s why every drop of knowledge gets deep inside their soul making them wise and evolved leader whose awareness and observation about any thing happening around starts achieving the great heights transforming them into an wise Human Being.\n\nIf you want to be a good listener you have to cultivate right listening skills and that will help you in becoming an effective listener. So only listening attentively is not enough you have to practice it and make it a habit . Until it\u2019s a part of your day to day activity , only listening attentively now and then is not going to help you much. People generally prefer to talk rather than listen, because the basic nature is to be heard , understood and get appreciated. We express through speaking out our thought , form our relationship and fulfill our need for belongingness and social acceptance. We consider it as invaluable tool in proving to others our intelligence, erudition and exceptional qualities . we don\u2019t perceive similar advantages in listening , considering it as passive and inferior activity. That is where our Vedas who starts with the word \u201cShruti\u201d or \u201cShravan\u201d establishes the fact that listening is paramount to be a accepted leader.So cultivate this art and make it your habit.\n\nWhen we say cultivate this art of listening we should also cultivate the right discretion to know when to talk and when to listen. You should practice listening not out of any fear of speaking , but out of strong commitment to improve your interpersonal and communication skills. You also don\u2019t listen because you want leave an impression on others , but to have a effective communication or debate.\n\nAll effective leaders use this art of effective listening for effective communication.Ask to the successful people they will tell you how important it is to listen sometimes then to speak for glory. When you listen attentively you increase your knowledge of people around you and enhances your awareness about your surroundings and that helps you in speaking right , taking right decision in that context in which you are. You become friendly to the world and your chances of being accepted as a leader increases.\n\nIf you want to build a meaningful relationship with people. become a good listener and control your urge to speak habitually. It is not an exaggeration to say that your relationship with your peers or family thrive on your listening skill more than your dominating speaking sessions.\n\nIf you are loving my articles do clap and share it, also If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe and i would feel blessed to hear and respond\n\nThanks for being an awesome reader\u2026.."

        "title": "The Millennial Entrepreneurs : Do You Have IT All ?",
        "text": "This word entrepreneurship is quite a buzzword and also my favorite topic being an startup consultant and mentor for some of the new age entrepreneur. Having experienced all kinds of emotion around it i feel this entrepreneurial voyage can be a blessings for some but can also be a slow killer (Emotionally) for most, if they have not done their homework right before venturing into it.\n\nToday we will try to decode what are the challenges as an entrepreneur and how you can prepare yourself well to avoid being emotionally drained while experiencing it. Also we will share some facts and figures about millennial entrepreneurship, But before that let\u2019s go into the history of entrepreneurship to understand how it started and how it transformed to this new age of startups and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe word Entrepreneur as been loaned from french word and first got it\u2019s mentioning in 1723, Historically the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work in the late 17th and early 18th centuries of Richard Cantillon, which was foundational to classical economics.The word \u201centrepreneurship\u201d was first coined in 1920 while french loan word entrepreneur dates back to 1850.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter in 20th century extensively studied entrepreneurship and said\n\nCurrent generation is popularly called millennials and entrepreneurs who decided to stand out and shine can be called as Millennial Entrepreneurs.\n\nThe term \u201centrepreneur\u201d is often compared with small business and sometime used interchangeably but there is a difference between the two, as entrepreneurship can be associated with starting a small business but not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense as it can be started by solo proprietor, but entrepreneurial venture mostly brings some innovative minds together to offer solution to the market which never existed previously and aim to grow and scale as they progress to build their startup, which is rarely a case with small proprietorship based business which majorly offers an existing product, services and a rarely a scalable .\n\nSo we have covered some basic stuff related to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, but now it\u2019s time to understand what are the challenges for this new age entrepreneurs and why most of them will never succeed in-spite having access to most of the resources at their discourse.\n\nHave you emotionally oriented yourself to sustain the phase of your entrepreneurial voyage when things will not go as per your plan . This is the real beauty of being an entrepreneur you will always phase the surprises which can bold you but if you are consciously competent you can sustain that phase with a more evolved being then you expected from yourself.\n\nFor some this situation can throw them for toss and put them out of business, but if you have the emotional intelligence to understand why life is putting you to test you can learn and grow out for good .\n\nWhen you are not alone in this journey and has lots of expectation to meet from the fellow members, clients and investors it become really important that you are emotionally healthy. Your health will decide if you can pull your startup out of troubled situation, because after all you are dealing with human beings around and not the machine.\n\nWhen i say you need to be emotionally strong both from mind and body i mean to say , you need to raise you awareness level and observational skills . You need to be fully aware of what and why of the situation you are in and have to make a emotional connect with the people you are dealing with. Are you daily habits are in alignment with the need of the body to keep it agile and receptive. These are few questions which you need to answer without failing to keep yourself fit for being an millennial entrepreneur.\n\nTo venture into your dream startup business can be easy sometimes but to keep the fuel going to sustain your ups and downs in this voyage can take a lot of toll of you. Entrepreneur who master the art of empathizing the people around them are the one\u2019s who find it easy to sustain and scale their business to the next level. People management doesn\u2019t comes naturally to everyone but the founders who learn and practice this skill-set stands out and help is building a profitable and futuristic business in all kinds of situation.\n\nSo yes you have all the resources, you have right kind of environment to thrive, you have the knowledge economy and experienced mentors around to get you through in your dream journey, but all these will cease to work if you have not oriented your body mind and soul which can sustain these moments of successes and failures. But if you have invested upon yourself both cognitively and emotionally you can be among the few who makes it big and help the people around to grow together.\n\nSigning off and wishing you all a very successful journey in whatever you plan to do with both soul & heart.\n\nIf you are loving my articles do clap and share it, also If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe and i would feel blessed to hear and respond"

They develop strong chemistry with all the stakeholders of the Project which fosters great team work and smooth process implementation .\n\nAn effective project managers understands that their prime role is to effectively communicate what is expected from whom , 80 % of the time of managers goes into communicating about the project tasks, so they do lot of homework to ensure their is no loop hole in the system and everyone around is well and timely informed.\n\nSo It\u2019s of prime importance that they effectively convey the project vision, ideas, tasks, goals and faults supplemented with well documented presentations to all the team members and clients. Project Manager always needs to be clear about what they want to communicate and to whom. Any kind of communication gap can fracture the functioning of project execution so they take the accountability and responsibility of processing the right information to right people, at the right time.\n\nAs we discussed great managers are excellent communicators and they bring this skills into great use while they negotiate on no of resources, project budgets, schedules, scope creep, and a variety of other compromises that are unavoidable. They are flexible, diplomatic but effective negotiator and manages to keep all the stakeholders happy and satisfied. This skills of theirs come handy when some unwanted , unplanned dynamic situation pops up indirectly effecting the project delivery.\n\nEffective Project Managers shows great leadership skills specially when cloud of fear, stress and chaos pops up . As project development involves humans the emotion flows and exchanges aggressively which can lead to some loss of energy , excitement among peers. In this situation managers shows great sense of humor and balanced emotional approach to inspire and motivate the team.\n\nGreat sense of humors helps managers to have different perspective to problematic situation , it helps them lifting the morale of the team and build a congenial work environment where everybody thrives to their best potential. Having this sense of humor also give managers an edge to deal with difficult clients . It gives them power to leads from front and also to confront from front\n\nThanks for being there and showering your love, If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe"

        "text": "Phone Numbers verification is now very common methodology being used in mobile application development in-order to authenticate user and verify that the user is unique . It is also a security mechanism which is being extensively used in banking application to protect users from fraud and unauthorized online account transaction. 2FA: Two Factor Authentication has given user the extra piece of mind mitigating their security concern against their online accounts.\n\nYou already have been using various third party OTP verification service provider like Google\u2019s Firebase phone authentication service, Msg91 SendOpt Mechanism etc.. , but if you are those crazy ones who likes to play with code there is a some good news Google Play Services has come up with an API to help you develop your own custom Phone Verification mechanism\n\nLets understand how to first ask user to put their mobile phone number together using phone selector API . User needs to send an sms from our app which will prompt them to input their mobile number, phone number selector api will help us in doing so , the code for the same goes like this :\n\nHintRequest initialization communicates to the Google Play Services that it requires to identify the user phone number. Then the play services opens the intent resulting in an input dialog where user can select the number to be used within the app. Phone Selector API doesn\u2019t requires any special permission from the user while implementing this mechanism thereby increasing the chance of better user registration/signup numbers for app developers.\n\nOnce user selects the number in the dialog and submit it a callback code called onActivityResult. Note that in some cases, depending on your phone, you may not get a phone number, so be sure to check if the credential is non-null. If you don\u2019t have a number, you\u2019ll need to provide a way for your user to type it in manually.\n\nThis code (Phone Selector Google Play Services ) only runs on the latest android devices which run latest google play services version 10.2.x and higher\n\nOnce you get the user phone number using phone selector you need to send the sms on user phone with the verification code to verify that the number given is valid. You will use google play sms verification api to achieve this task.\n\nThe SMS Verification API gives you the ability for the app to listen for an incoming SMS from which it can parse the code automatically.\n\nSee the code snippet to achieve this :\n\nAs shown above in code snippet SmsRetrieverClient is initialized as client variable which then starts the task to retrieve the sms. After starting the SMS Retriever, developer need to send the user mobile number to their server tobe saved, thereafter developer sends the customized messages with random code to the given number. The message template may look like\n\nThis one time OTP message can be a string which needs to end with hash code specific to the app.You only need to generate this hash once for your app package and signing certificate: it won\u2019t change and shouldn\u2019t be supplied by the client app.\n\nYour server can then send the message to the phone using your existing SMS infrastructure or service. When this message is received, Google Play services broadcasts an intent which contains the text of the message. Here\u2019s the code:\n\nDeveloper needs to send the message based on their Server infra to the users mobile phone via their app, once it is send across the message Google Play services opens a intent to broadcast the message using the following code snippet\n\nAs you can see in the given code above OnReceive broadcast receiver method you get the status of a message as extra, based on the status if it is received successfully developer can pull that verification code and send it across to the server to verify the user phone .\n\nSigning-off with a food for thought for app developers (mobile appreneur):\n\nSo Developers go and get your hands dirty and come up with your own OTP verification mechanism to be used in your apps and to be distributed as a tool for your fellow developers.\n\nIf you loved this contribution please share and clap as it fuels me to write more and contribute more to all you awesome readers\n\nThanks for being there and showering your love, If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe"

They are an anchor around which the entire project is hinged and if they fail to delegate their duties project is bound to meet its fate. To understand the project managers responsibilities it becomes important to define what is project and what is project management\n\nBut to accomplish any desired goal of a projects it become very essential that the manager who is going to lead it has to be experienced and well equipped with all the knowledge and tools to ensure project runs smoothly and reaches to its final destiny . So what are roles & responsibilities of the project managers , lets discuss this elaborately.\n\nThe Project Manager is responsible for delivering the project and has all the authority to plan and run the project on daily basis. S/He delegates their duties in following manner and covers following duties in their task delegation :\n\nProject Managers needs to deeply understand what the project requirements are and then accordingly plan\n\nTeam formation, infrastructure & resource planning, timeline and execution strategy all is clearly defined in this planning phase by experienced project managers. It is an ongoing process and is iterative in nature, which respects the stipulated timeline\n\nIn this stage project managers needs to plan the team structure based on organization resources available. Here the human infrastructure is defined for the the project where the main task is to identify roles and responsibilities of each person is defined to meet the project delivery. it covers all the personal resources required either as a full-time or part time. Lets summarize the project organisation requirement in pointers\n\nProject Manager once they have planned and set up the project organisational structure now needs to ensure every entity involved in project are functioning as per the pre-defined plan to attain the desired objective. One of the most challenging part comes down to leading for project managers as they have to depict excellent Emotional intelligence skills together with cognitive skills as they are dealing with humans with different set of skills. Project managers anchors the communication between team and client and has to make sure there is no gap involved in any context. Some of the key aspect covered in this are\n\n5. Delegating task at each stage of project execution based on the project need.\n\nProject Managers needs to be an excellent communicator and a leader full of confidence. Emotionally they can\u2019t go weak while dealing with talented brains , their soft skills needs to fire all cylinders to make sure their are not glitches in the project , most of the time project can go hay way and at that time their management skills are put to litmus test. In that demanding circumstances their emotional intelligence can play a vital role to keep team and project intact and function smoothly.\n\nAs we discussed that project can sometime go off-track due to some unexpected demand of the situation or due to chaos arising because of the dynamism. To bring back the project on track project managers needs to implement the project control mechanism which involved\n\nOverall how the project will shape and reach its desired goal depends upon the skill-set of project managers and the entire system rely heavily on his human management traits.\n\nThe compost and water mentioned above is what project managers needs to plan and arrange for in-order to do full justice to the project needs.\n\nThanks for being there and showering your love, If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe"

On this very day I chose to be fearless and decided to start a company Mobibit Soft Pvt Ltd with the intention to serve all my consumers and customers well and help them nurture their dreams while supporting our Team\u2019s vision of being the people oriented company .\n\nMy intent here is not to bore you with the typical entrepreneurs plight , rather to inspire you to take that first step which will lead you to the journey of your lifetime and will help you to go through this world fully satisfied and blissful\n\nSo here are few lessons which i learned in this entrepreneural journey of 5 years which illuminated many minds including me in our team, while fighting out all the adversity to become sustainable and now we are all set to scale and learn new things.\n\nWhen we started we were 4 founders from various domain and expertise, but we broke up in 6\u201312 months timeline. Why ? Because there were more brains involved but their brain was not functioning in sync with their heart , which is very important when you are at very early stage of your startup, too much logic defies the process of creating and begins to kill the idea of building something. When you put your brains you can\u2019t accept the failures and can\u2019t embrace it with open heart to learn from it. So it\u2019s a high chance that you will give up someday and loose the zeal to fight. That\u2019s what happened and i was left all alone to rebuild the things from ground zero. I accepted it gracefully , took the ownership and went on to rebuild it with few more people who put their heart with me and here we are standing now strong celebrating our 5th year of foundation.\n\nFounders of any startup needs to very clear from the beginning that building a startup is a team game and while you are doing so you need to collaborate with your clients and competitors to help them get what they are looking for. You can\u2019t survive this market if you want eat it all alone , when you understand this mantra that you are into a business of building others dreams , you will always be heading in right direction to build your own dreams and will be stable and grow for long haul.\n\nWe developed our first game it failed miserably, i can clearly remember that it was 1st of Jan 2013 and all my subordinate team members decided to move on to start on their own. I was disappointed a bit, but was happy somewhere in my heart that few rebels are in making . I took that incident positively, embraced the setbacks and evolved from there. I sat with myself, introspected what is that all i have. To be true, i had all what was required to rebuild again. We released the version 2.0 of the game which was bought to standstill and it brought the little fortune which was much required to refuel me to pursue my journey. Now we have developed and published more than 100 mobile apps, more than 50 clients served and have grossed more than 50 millions downloads for ourselves & for our clients.\n\nIf you really want to have an amazing life as an entrepreneur or as a human being one thing which is must is to practise how to give before you ask. Money for example has always been a byproduct for our team in whatever act we performed, we focussed to give our client an experience of their lifetime. We managed to retain few clients in doing this. Yes, we also lost some and it is perfectly normal, you can\u2019t always expect things to happens according to your plan, infact nothing happens as you plan for that matter , things happen as they are meant to happen. Our intent has always been right to be at the service of our customers and clients , understanding their needs first and then giving the best possible solutions. In doing this we grew out and here we are now, celebrating our 5th foundation day and feeling proud on whatever we have been able to achieve in this small stint.\n\nIf you want to live blissfully forever do one thing, invest in building great relationship with your users, clients and competitors. Make sure you know them in & out and that will really give you an advantage of giving them what they are seeking from you. Ultimate outcome will be that all the stakeholders will be happy and making money eventually. We practise this a lot and have some really amazing experience with our clients.\n\nI have a quote which i have coined to sum up what i mean by investing on relationship :\n\nSet yourself free of fear, there is nothing which you will lose, if you can act as per your strength and with an intent to give your best shot you will get lot more than you can ever imagine. You are a life full of possibility so don\u2019t put any kind of limit to it, go out with all you have not with what you know, as knowing is itself is a boundation. If you do anything being fearless and with less focus on the result you become a liberated soul which knows only one act and that is to simply act.\n\nHope this article will ignite your mind and soul to set you all free from all your baggage of fear.\n\nThanks for being there with me in my journey so far and helping me to become, what i have become.\n\nKeep clapping , keep sharing and showering your love."

        "title": "Adaptability Is The key To Avoid Startups Valley Of Death",
        "text": "In any kind of business either it\u2019s a startup or an established brand one thing which plays a pivotal role in helping it survive and thrive irrespective or market condition is \u201cADAPTABILITY\u201d. It\u2019s an art which has to be learned and practised extensively if one wants to build a competitive business model for themselves.\n\nThere are 3 important characteristics of Adapting which we will discuss and cover in this article together\n\nWilling enough to see the things as it is and to change the perception based on the context\n\nWe need to understand the problem upfront & willing to change the age old strategy which used to work earlier but now it is no more relevant\n\nEntrepreneurship is majorly an art of taking calculative risk backed by strong intuition and market needs. Business needs to invest in future while they have their current economics in place, may be it brings a little bit of risks in terms of financial investments but it pays of well as it has done in the past for many big brands who are thriving and controlling largest part of world economy.\n\nPeople who has this inept ability to change as per the situation without getting into any panic attack are the one\u2019s who are the creators and innovators. They always put their larger chunk of efforts and resources in assesing the current market dynamics and have the courage to take that extra mile to meet their desured goals.\n\nLet me put you through an excellent example of one of the top notch microprocessor manufacturing brand \u201cIntel \u201d which understood to value of adapting(change) and got out of the Valley of Death\n\nIt\u2019s a very popular case study of Intel which Popular Psychologist Daniel Goleman covered in his book working with emotional intelligence. Intel used to be earlier a market leader in memory chip manufacturing and microprocessor manufacturing has very little share in their business but suddenly intel started to get threatened by the rise of Japanese companies which based on its precision technology became the market leader in chip manufacturing overpowering Intel .\n\nIntel has to churn out the new strategy their leadership team has to regain their lost glory as survival was at stake , then what happened is a history . Intel stood up to the challenge and focussed on Microprocessor business, to gain user attention they came up with a campaign called Intel Inside , which transformed the perception of user who used to buy computer for its exterior, after Intel Inside campaign they succeeded in occupying user brain and heart and touched them emotionally.\n\nUser started to think processor inside as the computer itself and can\u2019t imagine the computer without it. This helped Intel to become the market leader in microprocessor manufacturing segment & came to their rescue to make them undisputed leader of their market segment, currently though samsung is strongly challenging Intel and are giving a tough fight to them but Intel has become the synonym for microprocessors\n\nIf we can master this art of adapting as the time changes and accept our weakness as a whole we will be able to sustain all the tough phases of our life to build a strong and sustainable startup/business which will be in the direction of consumer and owners well-being."

        "title": "A Journey From Barter to Bitcoin \u2013",
        "text": "In stone age days we used to rely on barter system to trade where goods were exchanged for goods. gradually money came into existence which carried certain values and got accepted as a payment medium for transacting an goods and services. It was adopted as a legal tender(currency) within any country to be used in any market.\n\nLet\u2019s go back into the history of money before we get into Bitcoin :\n\nA barter system is an age old practise and its history dates back to 6000 BC Introduced by Mesopotamia tribes and well adopted by Phoenicians where they traded goods across cities and oceans.\n\nBartering was officially first recorded in Egypt in 9000 B.C., when farmers would go to market to exchange cows for sheep, with grains passing through the hands of harvesters in exchange for oils.\n\nIn 1930 during Great Depression it became more popular and specially was used to exchange eatables. Group of Peoples involved used to act more like a banking system, where any of owners items when sold, used to get credited and buyer\u2019s account used to get debited.\n\nA gifting based system was mainly governed by social system where the people gifts people some goods or services without expecting any immediate or future rewards explicitly . It was more like a social values & custom based economy where people exchanged goods on particular events and considered it as relationship building kind of investment. It is prevalent in this modern age too. Some consider the gifts to be a form of reciprocal altruism\n\nWhen agriculture became mainstream in 9000\u20136000 BCE , both livestock and plant products were used as money. There is a remarkable statement by Aristotle where he spoke why money got created he said :\n\nMoney has a long history from Bronze age to the current 21st century\n\nBronze age was more a kind of Commodity Money an objects that have value in themselves as well as value in their use as money. Shekel was used by Mesopotamian, ancient china, africa & india used cowry shells.\n\nThe shekel was the unit of weight and currency, first recorded circa 3000 BC, referring to a specific weight of barley, and equivalent amounts of silver, bronze, copper etc.\n\nCoins were an evolution of \u201ccurrency\u201d systems of the Late Bronze Age, where standard-sized ingots, and tokens such as knife money, were used to store and transfer value. Indian coins were a kind of punched metal and Chinese were a casted bronze with holes in the center.\n\nThe very first coins used in U.S were called cents which was first introduced in 1793\n\nAccording to Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83) Hermodike of Kyme was the first perosn to issue coins\n\nMost coins(currency in modern term) currently are made of a base metal and their value is decided based on the country and its marketplace demand and supply needs, the value of the coin is decreed by government law and thus is determined by the free market only in as much as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded internationally on foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe paper based money came into existence in china and majorly was popularised by Song Dynasty in 11th century but the real development happened in 17th century for bank notes when Tang Dynasty(618\u2013907)who used it as merchant receipts to avoid heavy and bulk of coinage, credit notes were used to trade which had certain timeframe and certain discounts.\n\nIn Europe paper note came into picture in 13th century due to travellers like Marco Polo & Willianm Rubruck about which you can find the mentioning in Marcol Polos book The Travels of Marco Polo. Stockholms Banco issued the first banknotes in Europe in 1661. Before bank notes gold standards were into practise which with the advent of 19th century in europe started to be replaced by bank notes currency. had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.\n\nThe use of banknotes issued by private commercial banks as legal tender has gradually been replaced by the issuance of bank notes authorised and controlled by national governments. The Bank of England was granted sole rights to issue banknotes in England after 1694. In the USA, the Federal Reserve Bank was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorised currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver.\n\nCurrently as we are living in 21st century we mostly use currency (Bank Notes+ Coins) which is issued and governed by government fiat(law) . In England The Bank of England was granted sole right to issue banknotes in 1694. In 1913 The Federal Reserve Bank was granted the rights to issue bank notes in USA. The Reserve Bank of India was founded on 1 April 1935 to respond to economic troubles after the First World War and gradually after india went independent it became the authorised authority which controls the printing and circulation of indian currency called rupees and also drafts various economic policy to control the indian economy.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency of 21st century, It\u2019s a cryptocurrency now accepted worldwide specially in digital payment systems. The Digital currency (Bitcoin)uses a system which is peer-to-peer, and where transactions take place between users directly, without any intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was first invented by a Satoshi Nakamoto as an open source technology released in 2009.\n\nTo further understand blockchain please refer my previously published articles :\n\n1. Blockchain Technology Part 1 : What and Why ?\n\nSo the latest form of money is a cryptocurrency like bitcoin it is becoming popular because it has no third party to authorise the transactions, it handles direct transaction between two parties using peer to peer technology and is theoretically tamper-proof decentralised ledger system called as blockchains\n\nSince the inception of bitcoin the very first succesful cryptocurrency now there are many other types of crypto-backed digital coins which is gradually being adopted as official legal currency in many countries/territories like European union, Nigeria, southern african countries like south africa, namibia, zimbabwe. It is also legal in America to transact in cryptocurrency. India has not regularised cryptocurrency so people are involved in selling and purchasing of this digital currency. There are only few countries which has passed some kind of regulation against cryptocurrency so we can says bitcoins like digital currency is here to stay to transform into a completely new way of transacting between two people of party which gives them trust , save some unwanted taxes and most importantly saves their time and energy.\n\nAccording to Bank of England :\n\nThis cashless forms of payment in collaboration with mobility is going to reshape the entire mechanism of secure payment transactions. This modern age money is already being employed in digital contract signing , lending money in the form of bitcoins etc, and is also accepted a mode of payment against any property or services. The digital currency is being used to by and sell digital goods in many countries legally so if Bank of England says(as reported in telegraph )\n\nI feel this digital currency will revitalise the entire payment mechanism and will be the most preferred way of transacting services and goods as it brings that added layer of security and trust with it\n\nThanks for being there and reading \u2026\u2026\n\nKeep loving, Keep clapping and keep Inspiring\u2026"

        "title": "Top 3 Leadership Skills For Business Leaders \u2013",
        "text": "I very often quote and also strongly endorse it that,\n\nWhen i say sustaining is the difficult part i mean to say that when we start any business we have certain financial planning and business model in place and with some angel funding support we kickstart with the intention to make it big some day but there are certain skills which any business leaders need to have and acquire to remain at the top of whatever they are doing. What are those skills and attributes is what i will try to cover in next few minutes, so please be with me if you are looking for some guidance and tips as a business leader or as an entrepreneur\n\nThe best way to master any art is to be a seeker first. We need to surrender ourselves fully if we want to get into the depth of any thing which we want to understand and learn in out life. Learning ends then and there where we say we know everything. Specially if you are in a leadership position it\u2019s a high chance that we don\u2019t want to expose our weakness and so are reluctant to learn anything new, but it has to be other way round , we need to be willing and ready to accept the fact that we dont\u2019t know and orient ourselves to learn the art .\n\nSitting at the leadership position requires us to be more empathic and responsible. if your are running a business you need to make sure that it\u2019s services are more directed towards your team and users wellbeing first, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should forget your welfare, if your deeds are for others wellbeing it becomes their responsibility too to ensure that their leader is also well fed.\n\nSo I always say :\n\nWith this cause if you will lead one things for sure will happen that if the phase of adversity pops up, you will come out strong because you will have all the support from your team , they will inspire you to grow and your sustainability will be intact no matter what the situation is.\n\nTrue leaders are in full command of their vision and they make sure they convey it ingeniously to their team. They have confidence about their plan and clarity to implement backed with rocksolid foundation of conviction. Their troop have damn clarity of what is expected of them and what they are trying to achieve as a team. One of the skill whuch truly stands out in all the great leaders is that they are willing to accept that they are not always right and alone they are nothing, they listen and then frame their workplan which is holistic & acceptable.\n\nThanks for being a leader and being with me to experience my experiences as awesome reader."

        "title": "How Your Android Code Compiles To Deliver .APK Package File ?",
        "text": "New age programmers rely heavily on API, SDK\u2019s, Smart Editors to write codes, but there is a lot of process which goes behind to bring forth the finished product. Technically there are following stakeholders involved to make development happen\n\nProgrammer plays a vital role in setting up computers with necessary tools and softwares before they start developing any project using the editor. How your code which you write compiles and becomes an executable file is what we seldom give a thought. Today we will together decode the entire process of writing a code and getting the finished apk .\n\nIt includes Installing Android Studio and Configuring android sdk and JVM\n\nWe import necessary libraries and configure necessary permissions and dependancies based on project requirement and start coding as per the wireframe of the product.\n\nThis is where we will dig deeper. When we run our code from the editor following process takes place\n\n.class files is also known as Java byte-code this byte code further get converted to dalvik byte-codes which is the format which android os understands here all .class files and any .jar library files compiles to single classes.dex using dx command. DEX is called as Dalvik executable files.\n\nDEX files is memory efficient and loads very swiftly compared to JVM based .class files and is lightweight too .\n\nPackaging is done using android apkbuilder tool(APPT). It generate a .apk file from a DEX file + non-Java libraries + zipped resources. The file, resource files are compressed by aapt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) This .apk file is what you run on android device and is distributed to all the major app stores after being signed for release. User gets to download this files from Google Play Store and other app stores on their android powered device.\n\n2. The new app process generated by fork call loads the app code stored in classes.dex file, which comes packaged with the .apk file, it filters the classes.dex file from .apk and stores it into a separate directory. Android do not copy classes.dex files directly instead it converts Dalivik byte-code in classes.dex into native machine code which android OS hardware understand.\n\nAll classes.dex gets converted into an ELF shared object, this library format is called as OAT and the tool that converts the classes.dex file is called dex2oat.\n\nThe native OAT library version is mapped into the process as shown below and from there the android app is launched running initial android activity.\n\nBeing a mobile appreneur i feel blessed to be a part of mobile app ecosystem and to contribute to the developer community by sharing my expertise and experiences. Hope you all had a great time reading and if that helped in any sense please share and clap to encourage.\n\nThanks for being there and showering your love, If you want to hear more from me and want to consult Click Here and subscribe"

Have you painted the picture of how your first version of an app/product look like. It is good to have a complete blueprint of your idea but it become really easy to take it into execution when you have broken it into milestones .\n\nHere i am listing the pre-requisites of starting your own startup with the idea that you are not going to code yourself and hire your own team . Till MVP it is good to get it developed from the expert to save time, energy and money, but if you are well equipped you can do it yourself too\n\nThis is your very first step where you find few good people whose synergy syncs with your thought process and with whom you share your idea to get their superficial opinion. Some of these may agree to partner into your product idea after few discussion and long meetings. This idea brainstorming becomes more productive if you involve few people who can be your potential customer so that you get a real insights to polish your idea blueprint. Find entrepreneurs who have worked in similar kind of product, get feedback from them, it will really help you in cutting down crappy stuff if any from your product blueprint. Don\u2019t worry nobody will be snatching your idea, you are the father of your baby and nobody cares to father your child, so be open in sharing and fine tuning your blueprint.\n\nIf you have no prior experience or expertise in technology development do not worry , it is worth to hire a consultant who has proven background to take their opinion. They will give you the technical feasibility, choice of technology, and ideas of breaking your product blueprint into milestones which will eventually help you in planning your development schedule and cost. They can help you clear all your doubts whatsoever and put you in right direction. You can decide to get the entire idea developed by them also, but it is totally your decision to just consult and plan as per the budget and timeline .\n\nAfter you have spoke to your customers , your trusted friends , fellow entrepreneurs and have consulted the expert you have all the information about the finance you will require to kickstart. You expenses will involve\n\nSo it becomes extremely mandatory to have some financial backup to start with so that you can better plan your milestones to achieve without burning your hand.

Have an agreement in place , Give him your product blueprint and get the fine tuning done in the same to lock the first MVP development Lifecycle. Decide the PME(Project Management tool) to properly monitor the development phases. Coordination, co-operation and patience will play a key role for smooth development of the MVP as there will always be the situation and need which will pop up at the run time.\n\nOnce your first MVP is ready for testing do not be in a hurry to rollout it in to the market , have a bunch 50\u2013100 people which may includes professionals, amateurs, customers and your known friends and get beta tested so that the technical team can get the opportunity to fix all the changes and bugs suggested by your pilot users. QA is the most important stage of your MVP. It ensures whatever you are offering to your initial customers/users are functioning well and giving right kind of experience.\n\nHope this basic steps will help you in getting your dream product out into to the market.

        "text": "With more than 2 billion active android devices and more than 80 % marketshare in mobile OS, the android has become the most preferred development platform for many mobility startups . For many software engineers android development has become the first career choice. Android has come a long way since its inception in 2007, the first commercial device was launched in 2008 as HTC Dream since than the operating system has gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being 8.0 \u201cOreo\u201d, released in August 2017.\n\nOne of the latest announcement made by google at their official event during the I/O keynote, was that they will make Kotlin an officially supporte language for Android development. Their latest Android studio version 3.0 Preview has started to ship with the latest support environment for the developer .\n\nKotlin is an Android-compatible language that is concise, expressive, and designed to be type- and null-safe, java developer this enhanced libraries of kotlin will make your life more easy you can code more in less time, so there is nothing to worry as such, you can easily switch from classic android development mode to this advanced java based Kotlin environment which will give your more advanced tools. It has wonderful safety features in terms of nullability and immutability, which makes android app more robust , safe and optimum in working, this feature has made google to make Kotlin their preferred official language for their sdk.\n\nKotlin is slowly becoming popular among java developers who were using the old version of it to develop android based mobile app, to answer why kotlin we need to understand what are the loop holes in convetional java which led to the new language. I will list few of those problems\n\nJava\u2019s biggest weakness is the way they handle null exception(NPE). Null pointer exception is very common reason for android app crashes still java has not given a damn about it and doesn\u2019t handle it smartly. Jetbrain developed kotlin which is super efficient in overcoming NPE problem. Kotlin compiler comes with in built mechanism to handle null data via auto-cast mistake feature.In Kotlin all the variables are non-null by default which automatically stamps out the chances of occurrence of NullPointerException since it won\u2019t be compiled\n\nJava is more susceptible to memory leaks because of the way java handles non-static implementations of inner & anonymous inner classes ,keeping an implicit reference to the outer class making it prone to memory leakages. It\u2019s a basic design flow in Java which is known from a long time now\n\nApart from the above said weakness lets understand the pros of kotlin which can encourage you to switch if not yet thought.\n\nTo make more informed decision go ahead and try it yourself i can bet, you will start loving it more, the more you use it. The ease of coding and robust coding structure saves lot of your valuable time which you can spend learning more or in having awesome time with your loved ones. It is a fresh language and future too, so if want to have an excellent career Kotlin is a weapon you must add in your kitty. So what are you waiting for download new android studio 3.0 add the Kotlin plugin and get your hands dirty, have a feel and share your experience here with me, i would love to hear the same.\n\nThis will be my next articles in this series of Kotlin for developers here will will learn coding fundamentals of kotlin. Till then keep loving keep sharing and keep inspiring me so that i can keep writing for all your lovely readers.."

        "text": "Millions of people dream to work on their dream project and few of those bravo\u2019s who have the courage and conviction goes on to venture into their startup, but very few of them manage to sustain. Do you know why ? Well one of the key factor which plays a vital role in keeping startup/businesses in a healthy state is that their founders and key team members are physically and emotionally healthy.\n\nBeing an experienced player i can easily say that health is the most neglected part of our daily life, this is one topic which i feel needs to be addressed by all my fellow entrepreneurs if they want to stay long in this game .\n\nThere must be the reason why lot of startup entrepreneurs who are hustling very often ignore their own health. I think there is a serious problem in time management. Entrepreneurs specially who have started-up struggle hard to prioritise their time and health comes last in their to do list. You will very often listen them complaining about lack of time, but personally i don\u2019t think time is an issue. Poor time management skill is what driving this super humans crazy.\n\nWe do become the boss in planning our day but that boss has no control over their own wellbeing. What is the point of being a boss of our own destiny when we are not taking good care of our body, which is supposed to enjoy the perk of all our hard work. The journey which is the whole essence of being an entrepreneur is not being enjoyed fully. The freedom which we longed for as an entrepreneur is now becoming the dangerous evil, this very freedom has started to act against us.\n\nWe can't simply complain about lack of time and move ahead, specially if you are founder of any organisation, your are not alone, you are accountable for people who are putting their trust on you, and if you are not healthy enough how can you delegate the responsibilities in a healthy manner. Being an unhealthy founder can only lead to an unhealthy organisation. Your behaviour, your managerial skills , your emotional quotient all gets affected if your are not healthy. So there is no other alternative , keep health as your super-most priority in your to-do list and spare an hour or so engaging in activities which can lubricate your body , fuel it with right food , right exercise so that your thought process also gets right .\n\nBut it is not crime if you are a night warrior but make sure you spare an hour from your regular time to play some sports, or engage in dance , 10\u201315 min of yoga & meditation will help you de-stress yourself and if you can change your habit and start rising early you will do wonderfully well for sure.\n\nI am not a fitness celebrity or big shot for that matter but still i feel as a responsible fellow entrepreneur it\u2019s my responsibility to share my experiences .\n\nIt's universally proven that the best way to keep yourself healthy and energised is to start your day early & experience the beauty of our mother nature while taking a walk for min 15\u201320 min. Feel the fresh air and greeneries around you and connect with them, you will have a best solo time being close to the nature. Also morning hours gives you an opportunity to be social if you share your morning journey with your close friends or partner.\n\nOur age old Yogic practises has been with us from ages but with the technological advancement it has been loosing its shine. If you can invest 20 minutes daily on yoga and meditation keeping your gadget aside , it will prove to be your best investment decision. It will keep you in right shape and right frame of mind to make better decisions at your workplace. You will have the best experiences when your eyes are closed . Close it now how you felt blissfful right.\n\nEveryone knows that if you are physically ill you need to consult your doctor , take medicine and you will be alright. But nobody give a damn if they are emotionally stressed, feeling low or depressed , we never consult or talk to specialist for it . The largest bread of new age entrepreneur are fighting from depression, they feel isolated and do not speak their plight out. Sometimes they just need some dose of encouragement from the fellow being but they hesitate to speak out about their weakness and want to present the better picture to the world outside, which is really very precarious . This emotional need of yours has to be taken care with highest priority if you are going through some mental trauma. Go and consult your doctor , speak up to whom you trust, don\u2019t take all the burden alone , engage in more social activities instead of burning your energy on social media. Being emotionally fit should be the topmost priority if your running your startup or any business for that matter. You need to invest your time in activities which brings smile on your face, it can be your hobby or profession.\n\nDo spare time for your family they are your biggest health booster, they are your true treasure. If you can value your time you can get all the time to love and be loved. A healthy relationship boosts your EQ and you become more empathic and caring with the people around you . Emotionally fit person gets larger acceptability in their workplace and society so go out and practice empathy you will have no problem whatsoever.\n\nHope this articles inspires you & keeps you in extremely highest state of health so that you can truly reap the benefit of being human. if you loved it please share the same and appreciate as much as you can, as it will keep me healthy to give more\u2026"

        "title": "Have You Found Your Why ? \u2013",
        "text": "Have we ever thought why it is sometimes very easy to start something or to end it once for all , but it becomes extremely difficult to pursue what we started with in between, either it has to do with our relationship or work . It mainly happens because we only care about doing something, that very purpose (Why ) which helps us to sustain is not very well thought before we start. So when challenges pops up we are left with little clarity of how to conduct ourselves. Defining our purpose , finding our why has to be the primary objective for whatever Karma we plan to perform in our life.\n\nKarma with a purpose is what we have to live for ?\n\nOne of the great ambassador of Find your why concept Simon Sinek has beautifully explained Why We should start with our why first ?\n\nMost of you would have already listened to his magical talk about the Golden Circle, if not please click the link below , it is a must watch for budding entrepreneurs and people sitting in leadership position\n\nSo what is the first thing we need to do when we have figured out what we want to do ? Once we are clear about our idea or work defining what we are doing, the very first question we need to answer is why we want to do what we want to do ? Until we are clear about this aspect of our work we should not pursue. When we say find your why first we mean to say that define your purpose off why you want to do something ? that very purpose of getting into any startup/or pursuing your passion is actually an answer for your WHY ?\n\nSo it will be not be wrong if we equate\n\nWe can\u2019t simply start without any purpose in hand to go through the entire day. There must be a reason for us to wake up everyday and go out to work else, we will end up our life\u2019s journey wasting in doing things which we never connected with, having no purpose to live is nothing less than living in a hell. Let me simplify Why for you by giving my own Why ?\n\nAnd that why of mine gets an expression by the product and services which team mobibit built for ourselves and for our esteemed client, the intent is to see them smiling at the end of the day.\n\nRefer this Golden Circle Idea proposed By Simon Sinek to have better idea about finding your why :\n\nFor some it is to be happy themselves , for someone it is to make others happy and eventually attaining to their own bliss, for someone it is comfort for someone it is adventure , some love challenges some love being in their own shell , based on all your individuals traits you need to choose your profession or business you want to start, but when you start make sure you\n\n\u201c Start with your Why \u201c first\n\nOnce you have all the above 3 points in place you need to make sure you are maintaining what you have started and not deviating from your purpose no matter what is the stage of your business . As i have already spoken starting is easy ending is easy but maintaining(sustaining )is tough and for that to be intact we constantly need to revisit our purpose fine tune it, keep improvising , keep learning but never loose the sense of \u201c why we started at first place \u201d\n\nOne thing i can say with full conviction that nothing works well if it is not been done for others well being specially in service industry. Your purpose so should be less about you and more about the consumer of your service and that can only be realised if you are taking good care of your team members who are going to help you execute your What( idea/passion).\n\nGo first find your purpose then your journey will be become a meaningful adventure.\n\nHope you came here to find your why and my why behind writing this articles solves the purpose for both of us. Keep loving keep sharing and keep appreciating\n\nThanks for being there with me\u2026."

        "title": "Why Most Of The People Only Wish But Never Start-Up ?",
        "text": "How many time we come across a wonderful plan which we wish to start & execute someday , but that day never comes and the wait continues and eventually our wish goes dead with the time. Many dreams goes unfulfilled, many potential idea dies even before it can take it\u2019s first breath, many desires to be liberated vanishes but that ideal time which we often wish never comes.\n\nHave we wondered why it happens ? Why many people with necessary intellect and great idea fails to take that first step towards their cherished dreams ? Today we will journey together to unfold the reasons which stops us from achieving our desired goals.\n\nIf asked you will often get to listen this issues which is not a real reason, but many thinks so.\n\nPersonally i don\u2019t feel this are the reasons why one should never take that plunge, but there is one and the only one reasons which has killed many dreams, many ambitions to start and that is \u201c FEAR \u201c, The Fear of Failing, The Fear Of Loosing which in reality is not ours.\n\nOne thing which most of the people never accept or never brings in front is that, they had the fear of failure even before they started. I know that you know the reasons yourself, but the point is why it happens to most of the people ? Well i will try to answer this questions\n\nIt has to mostly do with our Brain, our brain has been nurtured right from our childhood to protect us from any mis-happenings. We have been very often shielded to not do this & that by our parents and relatives and so our brain has been wired to be very cautious of anything which can harm us or can lead to loss or failures. 85 % of the time we are in a state of worry for the things which actually has no existence but it takes a heavy toll on our mind and body lowering our agility , energy and IQ level, It is this state of unnecessary fear which leads to decisions paralysis on our part. When you send this negative signals to your brain it naturally tune itself to a defensive state and starts protecting you by putting you into a state where you become reluctant to take any actions, fearing the outcome to be negative even though you have not taken that action yet. You start imagining a world were everything is wrong and against you and eventually you postpone your decisions to be addressed later which is never in our control and never comes.\n\nAs we have discussed above that many of us struggle with this inner battle everyday. We are crippled by our own fear of starting and doubt our own capabilities. Our mind tries to safeguard us whenever we try to go out of our comfort zone , it takes a guard against any thing which it find threatening. So the solutions lies within us and ourselves. If we stop taking command from our pre-trained mind and start commanding it as we want to we can easily come out of our fear. Now we can send the positive signal to our brain and it will respond accordingly to make situation congenial for us to make our decisions with more clarity and conviction. We need to rewire our brain to act not out of fear but to act out of shear love to chase down our dreams irrespective the outcome. It\u2019s a battle against ourselves which we can easily fight out as it is our own creation.\n\nif worth sharing please don\u2019t hesitate to share, may you can help someone to get out of their comfort zone and inspire them to stand on their own.\n\nThanks for being there with me\u2026."

        "text": "In continuation to my previous article on Deep Learning\n\nToday we will understand Deep Belief Network(DBN) A type of Unsupervised Pretrained Networks (UPNs)\n\nDBN is a class of deep neural network which comprises of multiple layer of graphical model having both directed and undirected edges. It is composed of multiple layers of hidden units, where each layers are connected with each others but units are not.\n\nTo understand Deep belief networks we need to understand two important caveat of DBN\n\nIt consists of stochastic binary unit layers where each connected layers have some wieght. The stochastic binary units in belief networks have a state of 0 or 1 and the probability of becoming 1 is determined by a bias and weighted input from other units.\n\nLet\u2019s understand Deep Belief Net by this Image sourced from (Geoffrey Hinton,cs.toronto.edu)\n\nBoltzmann Machine is a stochastic recurrent neural network with stochastic binary units and undirected edges between units. Due to Boltzmann Machine limitation to scale RBM was introduced which consists of hidden layers unit having restricted connection between each hidden units. This structure help RBM to learn efficiently.\n\nSee below to understand more :\n\nDBNs are composed of layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for the pre-train phase and then a feed-forward network for the fine-tune phase. As shown in the network architecture of a DBN below :\n\nNow that we have understood the basics of Belief Net and RBM , lets try to understand how DBN actually learns. As DBN is multi-layer belief networks. where each layer is Restricted Boltzmann Machine stacked against each other to for the Deep belief Network . The first step of training DBN is to learn a layer of features from the visible units, using Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm. Then, the next step is to treat the activations of previously trained features as visible unites and learn features of features in a second hidden layer. Finally, the whole DBN is trained when the learning for the final hidden layer is achieved.\n\nNASA is using DBN to classify terabytes of high-resolution, highly diverse satellite imagery.\n\nMake machines your friend and train them to act and think like you so , they will make our life easy and help us save more time to sharpen our powerful intellect. Don\u2019t consider them as a threat consider them as your mate who knows only one thing to serve human better.\n\nToday we have covered the basics of DBN & RBM in our next series of Deep Learning we will look how DBN is trained technically using RBM Layers and other network architectures.\n\nIf you find this effort worth sharing do share and show your appreciation, it will be really encouraging for me to keep sharing experiences with you all lovely readers out there.."

Whatever i would share is purely on the basis of my experience so it is not mandatory that it have to be blindly practised or followed , everyone of you are supremely talented to pick your pointers and act.\n\nOne things which has always helped me in my good or bad days is that i have a great respect for time. I consider it as the most precious asset of my life and so should be the case for everyone. If you can\u2019t be at your workplace on time you will always be late in whatever act you have planned for the entire days eventually you are delaying your own vision and goals which you have set to achieve. Also make sure you are not wasting others time, if you can master this work ethics in your professional & personal life you will have lot of time to be happy and productive\n\nIt has been my learning that :\n\nAt your workplace If you are working in a team it becomes really important that we give our ears first instead of raising our opinion and jumping to conclusion, listen before you enforce your opinion on others.\n\nThe hardest skill to master is to speak last specially when you are in a leadership position, but if mastered you will find yourself receptive to all kinds of knowledge and experiences from the people around you.\n\nYeah it\u2019s pretty difficult to be true you right, specially when we are fighting out in this competitive world which is full of fake people flashing fake identity around, but that should not stop us to present the right image of what you are. Faking your image in your professional life may sometimes work for you and help in upgrading you to higher position but you will find it difficult to sustain that status quo which is based on weak foundation.\n\nThe most respectable and great luminaries always inspired people and connected with them because they never faked it out. They dared to present naked reality of themselves and spoke truth.\n\nYou may find these article interesting too : Go beyond your identity\n\nHope you all may find some pointers worth practising and if you guys find it useful please share the same among your peers, keep loving and keep sharing and i will keep writing for you lovely readers."

        "title": "Deep Learning : Autoencoders Fundamentals and types",
        "text": "In continuation to my previous article on Deep Learning : What & Why today we will go deeper and dissect the Deep Learning architecture types and discuss Autoencoders in detail.\n\nBefore we kickstart to demystify deep networks let\u2019s again define the Deep Learning. According to my understanding\n\nToday we will try to deeply understand how Unsupervised Pertained Networks one of the 4 types of Deep Network Architecture works\n\nThis unsupervised learning network further can be categorised as\n\nA autoencoder is a neural network that has three layers: an input layer, a hidden (encoding) layer, and a decoding layer. The network is trained to reconstruct its inputs, which forces the hidden layer to try to learn good representations of the inputs.\n\nThe autoencoder tries to learn a function hW,b(x)\u2248xhW,b(x)\u2248x. In other words, it is trying to learn an approximation to the identity function, so as to output x\u0302 x^ that is similar to xx.\n\nAutoencoders belong to the neural network family, but they are also closely related to PCA (principal components analysis).\n\nSome Key Facts about the autoencoder:\n\nAutoencoders although is quite similar to PCA but its Autoencoders are much more flexible than PCA. Autoencoders can represent both liners and non-linar transformation in encoding but PCA can only perform linear transformation. Autoencoders can be layered to form deep learning network due to it\u2019s Network representation.\n\nIt is one of the basic autoencoder which takes a partially corrupted inputs randomly to address the identity-function risk, which autoencoder has to recover or denoise.\n\nThis technique has been introduced with a specific approach to good representation. A good representation is one that can be obtained robustly from a corrupted input and that will be useful for recovering the corresponding clean input.\n\nThe idea behind denoising autoencoders is simple. In order to force the hidden layer to discover more robust features and prevent it from simply learning the identity, we train the autoencoder to reconstruct the input from a corrupted version of it.\n\nThe amount of noise to apply to the input takes the form of a percentage. Typically, 30 percent, or 0.3, is fine, but if you have very little data, you may want to consider adding more.\n\nIt a kind of denoising encoders which uses unsupervised pre-training mechanism on their layers, where once each layer is pre-trained to conduct feature selection and extraction on the input from the preceding layer, a second stage of supervised fine-tuning can follow. SDA is simply a multiple denoising autoencoders strung together. Once the first k layers are trained, we can train the k+1-th layer because we can now compute the code or latent representation from the layer below.\n\nOnce all layers are pre-trained, the network goes through a second stage of training called fine-tuning. We go for supervised learning mechanism her to fine-tune in order to minimise the prediction error on supervised task. We then train the entire network as we would train a multilayer perceptron. At this point, we only consider the encoding parts of each auto-encoder. This stage is supervised, since now we use the target class during training.\n\nThis section has been sourced from deeplearning.net (great references for people who wants to understand deep learning). they have beautifully explained the Stacked Denoising Autoencoders with example :\n\nWe can see the stacked denoising autoencoder as having two facades: a list of autoencoders, and an MLP. During pre-training we use the first facade, i.e., we treat our model as a list of autoencoders, and train each autoencoder seperately. In the second stage of training, we use the second facade. These two facades are linked because:\n\nwill store the sigmoid layers of the MLP facade, while will store the denoising autoencoder associated with the layers of the MLP.\n\nNext, we construct sigmoid layers and denoising autoencoders, where is the depth of our model. We use the class introduced in Multilayer Perceptron, with one modification: we replace the non-linearity with the logistic function\n\n). We link the sigmoid layers to form an MLP, and construct the denoising autoencoders such that each shares the weight matrix and the bias of its encoding part with its corresponding sigmoid layer.\n\nAll we need now is to add a logistic layer on top of the sigmoid layers such that we have an MLP. We will use the class introduced in Classifying MNIST digits using Logistic Regression.\n\nThe class also provides a method that generates training functions for the denoising autoencoders in its layers. They are returned as a list, where element i is a function that implements one step of training the corresponding to layer i\n\nTo be able to change the corruption level or the learning rate during training, we associate Theano variables with them.\n\nNow any function takes as arguments and optionally \u2014the corruption level or \u2014the learning rate. Note that the names of the parameters are the names given to the Theano variables when they are constructed, not the names of the Python variables ( or ). Keep this in mind when working with Theano.\n\nIn the same fashion we build a method for constructing the functions required during finetuning ( , and ).\n\nNote that and are not Theano functions, but rather Python functions that loop over the entire validation set and the entire test set, respectively, producing a list of the losses over these sets.\n\nThe few lines of code below construct the stacked denoising autoencoder:\n\nThere are two stages of training for this network: layer-wise pre-training followed by fine-tuning.\n\nFor the pre-training stage, we will loop over all the layers of the network. For each layer we will use the compiled Theano function that implements a SGD step towards optimizing the weights for reducing the reconstruction cost of that layer. This function will be applied to the training set for a fixed number of epochs given by .\n\nThe fine-tuning loop is very similar to the one in the Multilayer Perceptron. The only difference is that it uses the functions given by .\n\nThe user can run the code by calling following python CLI :\n\nBy default the code runs 15 pre-training epochs for each layer, with a batch size of 1. The corruption levels are 0.1 for the first layer, 0.2 for the second, and 0.3 for the third. The pre-training learning rate is 0.001 and the fine-tuning learning rate is 0.1. Pre-training takes 585.01 minutes, with an average of 13 minutes per epoch. Fine-tuning is completed after 36 epochs in 444.2 minutes, with an average of 12.34 minutes per epoch. The final validation score is 1.39% with a testing score of 1.3%. These results were obtained on a machine with an Intel Xeon E5430 @ 2.66GHz CPU, with a single-threaded GotoBLAS.\n\nWe will cover more examples and references for Denoising Autoencoders & also cover Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) & Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in our next articles in continuation to our series Deep Learning : What & Why till then keep showering your love, keep spreading and keep supporting \u2026"

        "title": "Node.Js Vs PHP : Battle of Supremacy & survival \u2013",
        "text": "Before we jump on to the battle of Node.js Vs PHP, firstly we need to understand why this has been a talk for a while now in the developers community, specially for the backend developers. This all started with the unparalleled increase in the users demand for smartphone apps. The Apple App store boasts close to 2 million of these apps while Google play has over 2.2 million Apps. The success of some of the popular social apps , games and messaging apps has forced the programmers to adapt to the new backend technology which can handle multiple concurrent request simultaneously. Millions of users are exchanging some or other kind of data from their smartphone apps , to process such huge amounts of data companies are heavily spending on making their backend infrastructure robust and scalable. With machine learning & big data catching up rapidly in technological landscape developers has this huge responsibility to keep up with the pace and upgrade themselves to new level .\n\nThe front end of a website/mobile apps are possible only because their needs are taken care by server side technologies. The back end of a web/app consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website/app to even exist in the first place.\n\nIn the server side programming php has been the legend, earlier Javascript used to work in tandem with php, where PHP used to handle all the server side task between port no 80 and Database(MySQL) and JS handled the basic look and feel , little event handling on web browser. Most of the popular CMS rely heavily on PHP for their server transactions, but with the advent of Node.js Framework in 2009(Founded by Ryan dahl) scenario changed friends became competitors and the battle for supremacy and survival started between the two. They both are now playing a game of throne to win the developer mindspace, One is super hero who has the legacy and experience behind it and one is a overnight superstar which boasts of speed and excellence over it\u2019s old counterpart.\n\nLet\u2019s put them against each other on following parameter & understand the winners based on the Performance Parameter.\n\nThe choice of PHP or Node.js is totally a decision which is based on the need of the application/website, if we need a heavy data lifting and has to handle multiple concurrent connections requiring quick turn-around time at consumer app side Node.js has the upper hand, though there has been enhancement at PHP frameworks side which can also handle concurrent connections, still Node.js is a clear winner for me. Node.js provides a purely event-driven non-blocking infrastructure to script highly concurrent programs.\n\nAs per some reports, in terms of scalability of LinkedIn\u2019s mobile backend infrastructure: the company was able to move from 30 servers down to just three, while still having enough headroom to handle roughly ten times their current level of resource utilisation when they decided to switch from ROR to Node.js . There\u2019s been a lot of talk about PayPal moving from Java to Node.js for an application platform. The Node.js app was built almost twice as fast with fewer people, written in 33% fewer lines of code, constructed with 40% fewer files.\n\nThe standard PHP Zend runtime uses an interpreted compilation strategy, leading to less optimised code execution than a good JIT-(Just-in-Time)-based runtime which is at the core of Node.js, it uses V8 JS Engine for JIT compilation giving Node.js extra mile edge in starting up time.\n\nNode.js uses Just-in-Time compilation with the V8 JavaScript Engine. This strategy for dynamically typed languages has proven itself but does often increase startup time a little. PHP with HHVM & HACK open source run time alternative is catching up with Node.js as HHVM uses a Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation approach to achieve better performance.\n\nAs we have spoken that Node.js is super efficient in handling multiple concurrent request, it is made possible because it uses a non-blocking event loop (which utilises single thread)as compared to PHP Zend Runtime which uses a blocking process, due to this limitation PHP has to depend on multiple threads(process) to serve the web services request. If there is a heavy lifting done at user side and they are putting multiple connection request at a given point of time, server can run out of resource to address those process request, causing delays in HTTP response to the client side web/app.\n\nWeb servers like Apache and NGINX have ways to improve the PHP multi-tasking performance to some extent, but these are more limited than true language support for multi-tasking. Facebook HHVM project released in 2014 is trying to remove this limitation at PHP side .\n\nMany people has done some performance benchmark testing on Node.js Vs PHP Vs HHVM(supporting PHP) based on\n\nClick on the image to go to the benchmark website and see the full setup details.\n\nThe following CombSort sorting benchmark is a strict CPU test.\n\nHHVM is seven times faster than plain PHP (by system time), but Node.js is more than five times faster than HHVM in this number-crunching test.\n\nIn terms of RAM usage, HHVM is much more efficient than PHP, but Node.js is even better.\n\nAs an technologist and entrepreneur one things which always fascinates me is the CHANGE. Developer has to always adapt the technology based on the market need, so it is not about the battle between the technologies it is more about the choices we make to make the life of the end user who is going to use our technology better . As far as future is concerned yes Node.js is a way to go as far as knowledge base (code base), community support is concerned PHP still has the edge. So developers make your conscious choice which technologies fairs better for you and for your client and make wise decisions because ultimately end product matters the most . Consumer is king and so technology should facilitate it. PHP is here to stay and is going nowhere and Node.js is definitely the future."

        "text": "I have been covering AI & ML in my previous articles\n\nThis whole technology of putting artificial brain into machine is really fascinating , we humans because of our ingenious intellect has this natural instincts to go beyond what seems impossible to create tools and technology which becomes an extension to our day to day life, which can make decisions on our part and make our living super efficient. It is with this urge to make humans super productive we started putting artificial intelligence to the computer machines and now we have come a long way to build machines which can nearly think like human brains.\n\nToday we will see how Deep learning a branch of ML is really doing justice to all those valuable data floating around in this universe and processing it efficiently to help us reach to some rational conclusions in the filed of Speech recognition, Image Recognition , NLP , Healthcare , Financial Sector etc..\n\nAs we know that various Machine Learning techniques has been used to process our raw data to help us is content filtering on social network , to write recommendation engine for e-commerce based portals, In Image and Pattern recognitions, to transcribe speech to text etc. Most of these task are being implemented using a most popular class of ML called Deep Learning\n\nIn 1986 Rina Dechter coined the expression Deep Learning for the first time, but Ivakhnenko & Lapa in 1965 wrote the first working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965.These ideas were implemented in a computer identification system by the World School Council London called \u201cAlpha\u201d, which demonstrated the learning process.\n\nTo understand how deep learning works we need to understand its architecture in depth.\n\nThere are generally 5 most popular deep learning network architecture :\n\nLets get more into the depth of each Deep Network architecture\n\nRNN is a type of artificial neural network(ANN) where each connections between machine units forms a directional circle.\n\nWhen back-propagation was first introduced, its most exciting use was for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Juergen Schmidhuber: a leading researcher in ML gave an awesome explanations of RNN :\n\nFor tasks that involve sequential inputs, such as speech and language, it is often better to use RNNs . RNNs process an input sequence one element at a time, maintaining in their hidden units a \u2018state vector\u2019 that implicitly contains information about the history of all the past elements of the sequence. When we consider the outputs of the hidden units at different discrete time steps as if they were the outputs of different neurons in a deep multilayer network, it becomes clear how we can apply backpropagation to train RNNs. RNNs are very powerful dynamic systems, but training them has been a bit challenging because backpropagated gradients either grow or shrink at each time step, so over many time steps they typically explode or vanish.\n\nIt consist of rich architecture like\n\nRNNs consist of a rich set of architectures (LSTM is one of the popular topology RNN network ). The key differentiator is feedback within the network, which could manifest itself from a hidden layer, the output layer, or some combination thereof.\n\nNext we will go more deeper into Deep learning techniques like RNN, CNN, DBN etc in details and see how they works with some practical examples and also understand advantages of deep learning techniques .\n\nIf you find this article informative please support by spreading the same."

        "text": "As a child we always went beyond our limitation to explore and understand about worldly things. We bombarded people around us with loads of question and are never hesitant to ask, have we ever wondered why ? Well answer lies in the matter of fact that kids are beyond identity , they don\u2019t act as per intellect as their intellect has not be hijacked by the so called knowledge. They act as per their curiosity to seek and often they put why ? against whatever they come across.\n\nAs we start growing within the system and society our intellect which functions based on whatever memory(knowledge)overpower our basic instinct of seeking , we start identifying ourself strongly as name , gender, position, designation, cast & creed, all these starts creeping in our thought process and the misery starts. But if we conduct ourselves in a certain manner identity can be a boon too , though most of the time it\u2019s a cause our misery.\n\nIn psychology, identity is the qualities, beliefs, personality, looks and/or expressions that make a person (self-identity) or group (particular social category or social group). The process of identity can be creative or destructive.\n\nThe Biggest issue with identity is that people functions within certain boundaries. As a human being we have limitless possibilities to create the unimaginable, our intelligence when applied without any limitation gives us the power to go beyond and question the existence eventually leading to some innovation which is beyond human imagination. When we start thinking in a certain way and starts applying our logical mind we don\u2019t do justice to all the possibilities in our life. Today what all progress and digital revolution we have made has been made possible because we human being never settled for less, we always wanted to explore more and so is the result that now we can be as lazy as possible still all our tasks are performed in splits of a second. Some ingenious soul , some inquisitive mind went beyond their limitation to discover and innovate new technologies which has made us the most blesses generation of all time.\n\nYes it is true that certain labels has been put around every individual based on knowledge , society and education systems but that doesn\u2019t stops us to experiment, to explore or to seek. We should not be a believer of something we should be a seeker.\n\nThe moment we shed our identity as particular gender, cast , creed , position & accept ourselves as simple human life which has no boundaries , we start acting to accept everything around as our own , we become inclusive in nature, now every living and non-living being all are simply life in our understanding. The moment we stop acting based on our intellect(Rational Mind) always, we become receptive to others , we become sensible listener, we start experiencing the unexperienced , the energies all around suddenly become a part of us, So all the questions of you & me , this and that ceases to exist and we become a full-fledged life who knows no boundaries . The so called Identity crisis will never be a case for all inclusive being"

This aspiring souls are the one\u2019s who dare to do something, but they also need to think in a more realistic framework where they have to put a questions mark around what they want to do.\n\nSo todays article is dedicated to those aspirational people who are fearless but realistic in their approach . They know that if they put their hands in the fire they will burn themselves, but they also understand the fact that there are ways to overcome those kinds of obstacles if they are fully prepared and aware of what all is required to start any business/startup of their own.\n\nSo if you are still with me that means you are one of the aspirational soul who are looking to start his/her business venture. We will together cover this journey where i will lay down few key pointers which one has to keep in mind before they put their first step forward towards his/her startup vision. First let\u2019s define a startup\n\nA startup is nothing less or nothing more than those aspiring souls who have dreams and courage to deliver and who lives in realistic world to come up with a problem worthy enough to solve. So what are the key founding elements to ensure that any startup which has started can sustain.\n\nDon\u2019t Startup If You Don\u2019t Have Answers to These Questions\n\nYour Idea has no value if doesn\u2019t answers the why, what & how of it. The entire concept has to be well documented after sufficient competitive & market analysis. So before you start make sure you have clear cut business blueprint which can help you plan your execution strategy based on the requirements and lacunas identified. This preparation will help us to be ready for any contingent situation and make the entire development process super efficient.\n\nDon\u2019t venture into any startup specially a technology & operation driven startup without analysing the fund requirement. As founders will be the first investor for their startups they should take it even more seriously as they will be needing funds for their own survival while they are totally invested in setting things up for their dream startup. Also they need to have clear cut roadmap of financial expenses for at-least 1st year of their business . If they have financial planning intact their foundation will be rock solid to sustain the challenges which they will face in building their product and will have all the time to validate their idea in real market scenario.\n\nSo overall Solid Team, Sustainable Business Plan & Initial fund reserve to bootstrap the startup can really set the right conditions & stable foundation over which the aspiring and fearless startup warriors can build their business which will be long-lasting and impactful."

        "text": "We human beings are the most sophisticated living gadget on this mother earth, We are the most powerful intellectual machine which has it\u2019s own intelligence to make decisions, our intellect made sure we ruled over all other living creatures on this planet. We learned to acquire all the skills which was necessary for our survival but once our survival process was ensured we started to explore more, our infinite intelligence which knows no boundaries wanted more. We started to invent tools which will help us save time for ourself and ensure more safety and security, gradually we ventured to invent machines which can be an extension to our intellectual brain and memorise more information and multitask for us .\n\nThe very first computing machine called Turing-Complete was invented by Charles Babbage in 1833, since then computer machine has transformed from Analog era to Digital Era.\n\nThe concept of AI was introduced by John McCarthy together with Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1955, and organized the famous Dartmouth Conference in Summer 1956. This conference started AI as a field.\n\nThe very basic questions which needs to be addressed here before we jump on to the definition of Artificial Intelligence is Why Artifical intelligene ? when we human being has got this supremely powerful computing brain. Why the virtual intelligence is required even at first place when we have the intellect of our own. Well it all coin downs to one word \u201cDecision Making\u201d, it was conceptualised because we human being felt that we can\u2019t be present every where and can\u2019t take decisions remotely without being present at that place which became necessary specially after Industrial revolutions and now it has became a necessity after digital revolutions where information are being generated in trillions of bytes.To process this information and to reach to some virtual conclusion we needed that computer machine to think and perform like human brains and so the Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \u201cAI winter\u201d), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.However, in the early 21st century statistical approaches to machine learning became successful enough to eclipse all other tools, approaches, problems and schools of thought.\n\nWe want our machine to think like human, giving them the intelligence of their own by feeding them lots of information simulating the environment similar to our real world, given the fact that they can process huge information in splits of a second. This entire AI computing is to facilitate humans to perform their task with more efficiency where they get an opportunity to become extremely comfortable (for me it\u2019s lazy) and rely on machine to make decisions on their behalf .\n\nAI Research is majorly focussed in developing intelligent programs which can simulate human intelligence in the field of\n\nThere are basically 4 types of AI\n\nArtificiall General Intelligence (AGI) \u2013 (hypothetical) machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem, typically meaning \"at least as smart as a typical human\".\n\nSuperintelligence \u2013 (hypothetical) artificial intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds.\n\nMostly there are opensource Developer tools which has been built by aspiring opensource community and some of the notable opensource tools being utilised in Artificial Inteligence to make our machine have their own brains are\n\n4. RapidMiner : It is a platform of a Data Science awhich came into ezistenve in 2006 and has mainly be used for business and commercial applications as well as for research, education, training, rapid prototyping, and application development and supports all steps of the machine learning process including data preparation, results visualisation, model validation and optimization\n\nWhats Next : In continuation to this AI series we will deeply cover each tool which are largely being used to help us build this super Intelligent machines and also cover Deep Learning which is the most futuristics and advanced Machine Learnig techique."

We are easily the most well equipped and most comfortable generation as compared to our ancestors , fathers and forefathers. All credit goes to Mobile and mobility software solutions which has made possible for the people to connect in seconds, transacts at will without investing too much time and energy. They can now multitask and plan it right at their fingertips, billions of dollar are being transacted because of mobile app based fin-tech solutions. All the thanks to mobile app developer community and to the entire ecosystem of mobility.\n\nLets understand how mobile app ecosystem has shaped the current and how it will impact our future.\n\nThe biggest contribution of mobility to the humanity is that it has completely removed the communication gap in every aspect of human existence. In split of a seconds contents/information are being transacted from source to destination. Also the records are being maintained where there is no chance of loosing any information which has been communicated , so eventually there is no way parties involved in communication can complaint of information loss resulting in more reliable and efficient system. Whatsapp has slowly become the most widely accepted mobility solutions among small and large business community for quick communication. The biggest plus point of this mobile age solutions are that they are scalable and fits into your pocket.\n\nIn my childhood days we used to seek permissions to visit our neighbourhood for watching our favourite shows like mowgli, Sigma, Ramayana, Mahabharata etc, then one fine days my siblings and me got super excited when TV became the new member of our family. We were happy to change channels manually to tune into our favourute shows but now in my mid 30\u2019s i can literally see people pulling to pocket tv avaialble right inside their handset and in 5\u201310 years TV will be replaced by compact and smart cutomisable tv. You can not only view your favourite shows but also record and watch later if you are short of time. Earlier we used to listen song using radio, tv, music player, CD player but now all this has been replaced completely by of our handset, now you carry 1000\u2019s of curated music in your pocket and listen it at will . So mobile has not only entertained us but also helping us plan our time to do so. Mobile has given us freedom to be entertained and work simultaneously.\n\nIn this age of instant gratification standing in queue is no more preferred by youth for their banking related solution and issues. Banking apps have given the comfort of transacting and raising issues right from their mobile appliactions avaialble at user mobile phone. Paymemt wallet is slowly replacing cash to a digital currency which can be exchanged for whatever thing you can imagine to buy or transact, human emotions are exception though but still mobile has started to control that too. All financial transactions are being done digitally saving paper and helping us go green.\n\nTrading has been existent right from our Neolithic and Paleolithic age. But in this digital age it has transformed entirely now the barter system has been repaced by Digital currency like bitcoin. Now you don\u2019t have to travel miles away to transact, you see the product in your eCommerce application make informed decision to buy out the product and pay the amount digutally. Bitcoin is slowly revolutionizing the financial and banking sector and is widely accepted in excahge of goods of your choice. Earlier commerce was done physically exchanging goods for goods, now we are buying ans selling digitally called as eCommerce. This journey from barter to eCommerce has been largely possible because of mobile commerce.\n\nSome other prominent impact this pocket size gadget is making\n\nWith every advancement we human beings are making in this digital era we just need to be more responsible in handling and putting this gadget to use, after all we have invented this for our betterment and comfort. If we can use it judiciously we will make this world even more better place to live, on a flipside it can become the singlemost reason for human destruction too.\n\nI will sign-off by giving you a food for thought :"

        "title": "My Perspective On What It Takes To Be A Great Leader ?",
        "text": "Leadership in this 21st century is quite often linked with business world, but you can\u2019t truly understand what is leadership if you only see it within the pedigree of business and management, Leadership skills are required the most when you are not acting within predefined set of rules , here you have to have a vision to understand the situation and respond accordingly, your actions needs to speak volume and inspire millions to chase their dreams relentlessly. Leaders have the greater responsibility and accountability to whatever act they perform. They share the success but own the failures individually. Greatest leaders of all time never practised the concept of me first they always believed in sharing and caring startegy.\n\nOne of the greatest epitome of true leadership was Nelson Mandela (Mandiba) some of his inspiring thoughts are still very relevant and we can easily figure out the true leadership quality one needs to have to be an inspiring leader.\n\nNelson Mandela used to say :-\n\n\u201cI am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being an optimist is keeping one\u2019s head pointed toward the sun, one\u2019s feet moving forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lies defeat and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, pure generosity, absence of vanity, readiness to serve others \u2014 qualities which are within easy reach of every soul \u2014 are the foundation of one\u2019s spiritual life.\u201d\n\nif you would have kept your mind wide open while reading the sayings of great Nelson Mandela mentioned above you can understand what it takes to be a truly great leader. Based on my personal entrepreneurial experiences and study of some great leaders i would like to share the top 5 important\n\nleadership traits which can guide you to grow and help others grow.\n\nGreat leaders care for others feelings, they are compassionate even to their wrong doers. One of the great quality which made Mandela the greatest leaders was that he had the capacity to transcend himself for the sake of those around him and higher causes. Feeling compassion for those who had caused him pain and his desire for reconciliation makes him a true leader who inspired the entire generation & continues to do so.\n\nIf you can\u2019t feel what other people around you feel you are lifeless. Lifeless people are very often controlling in nature and this can lead to true disaster specially if you are in leadership position.\n\nWhen you are in a position of leadership (in any organisation) you should never forget that you are into a business of serving the people first who you are responsible to lead and then that team is accountable to serve the end consumer. C level executives has major responsibility to serve the team who are responsible to serve the client or consumer, but unfortunately they are concerned more about generating profits for their investor and less about people who are looking up to them.\n\nMahatma Gandhi & Nelson Mandela had the strong believe and vision for cause they were fighting for, irrespective of immense adversity their faith was rock solid , for them the cause(service to the nation/masses) had the highest priority than their own individual well being . Leaders who has the purpose larger than their individual welfare and whose actions are directed towards people well being, are generally blessed with rock solid conviction. They are not afraid of taking bold steps, they lead from front and set an example to be followed.\n\nImpactful leaders don\u2019t believe in taking the credits they give credit to the team for all the success and are willing to own the failures themselves. This one trait can be be found in every single great leaders. They know the value of empowering people, they understand that until the troop is well served and empowered they can\u2019t fight the bigger battle\n\nGreat leaders never try to manage the people they allow the people around them to develop the required assets so that the entire team is well equipped to fight for the larger cause. They set the clear cut vision for all the team members and set them free to deliver the results. Leaders are fully aware of the fact that if things are not working as per the desired plan there must be something wrong with their own leadership styles and try to improve by seeking the feedback from their team members. They are futuristics in their approach of leading so they try to prepare the future leaders from their team members who can pursue on their own when situation is not congenial.\n\nGreat leaders quests for a larger cause and want to leave impact by paving the path which can guide others to flourish. They Start first but are happy to end up last in the race of life. They don't live to prove they learn and help others to improve."

Here the catch is that since their a role of a third party in the transaction, both parties trust can be compromised. But with the evolution of Blockchain technology this concerned has been mitigated to a large extend.\n\nAs i covered the fundamentals of smart contract in my last article Blockchain fundamentals today i would try to further explain it in a language which is easy for everyone to understand .\n\nBlockchain collaborates with smart contract to removes the need for third party centralised system to executes the contract between two parties, thus making the decentralised system more reliable and secure. Here untrusted parties can directly transact with each other by executing a smart contract based on their negotiated terms.\n\nThe beautiful representation of smart contract is given by shermin voshmigr & valentine kalinov\n\nAs you can see in above infographics that smart contract completely eliminates the need for trusted third parties and thus makes it easy for stakeholders to directly executes their transaction and removes any chances of fraud.\n\n6. Updating the transaction record details after code execution across all the nodes involved in transactions. Once updated the details can\u2019t be altered.\n\nWill decode the technical operation of smart contract executions using blockchain in this series of Blockchain Technology\n\nKeep inspiring by clapping if you are loving my series of articles on Machine Learning & Blockchain\n\nThanks for being with me .."

Why we live in stress ? etc..\n\nWell our entire life circles around dealing with people around us so it becomes very important that we learn the art of People Management having said that it is also true that it requires a lot of skills to handle the expectations & problems which pops out of blue from the people which surrounds us . So how can you groom yourself and prepare yourself to be an effective people manager is what the essence of this article will be .\n\nBeing a father, mother, daughter, son, a business owner, husband, wife, friends etc.. we play a different role at different places based on the context & resources available to our disposal, so it is important that we make our decision based on the situation & the role we are into. The moment we try to act without understanding the situation and make our conclusion based on our past experiences we miss the point and become judgemental instead, if we become more participative and try to listen to the perspective of the other counterpart we can read the situation well and can respond effectively instead of reacting.\n\nThe art of listening is something which everyone irrespective of their nature of work or role should practice. it\u2019s difficult to master but it\u2019s very effective tool to avoid any kind of physical or mental conflicts. Great leaders and managers has inept trait of being a patient listener, they believe in hearing what others has to say and value their opinion before framing their rational opinion. Thus they can handle the people around them with in more calm and composed manner.\n\nBe caring and connect with people around you emotionally. People who lacks empathy for others find it hard to be an effective team player . They may shine and stand out but they fail to lead. Inorder to lead and manage the people you need to feel what they are feeling, you need to get into their shoes before trying to make any decision about them.\n\nYou need to have emotional intelligence to handle any situation, specially when you are sitting in a responsible position, you can\u2019t delegate your task untill you know your team players beyond your rational mind. people management skills comes with giving more and taking in the last.\n\nHope my experiences are making some contribution to help you live wonderfully well."

        "text": "Being a startup founder myself and with a prior experience of building a startup from scratch and sharing both successful moments and moments of failure one great learning has been that we can\u2019t pin point any specific reason for the startup failures. There can be more than 50\u2013100 reasons which can lead to startup not able pulling it off and eventually have to shut the shop or pivot to different business model or restructure the entire startup business\n\nLet\u2019s first understand what actually startup looks like , One of the most practical and relevant definition of startup has been given by Eric Ries . He said\n\nSo one thing is very clear that startup comes into existence with a purpose to solve . They not only have to define the problem statement but also need the financial support to experiment with their business model and reach the right market-fit stage till then it\u2019s all the test of founders and team members character and coordination with each other, how the entire team allign with a startup\u2019s vision plays the pivotal role in sustaining the bad phase which is unavoidable.\n\nAs per smallbiztrends.com some of the stats related to small startup failures are\n\nBut being a founder you don\u2019t need to give too much thought to numbers , yes it\u2019s important but as an entrepreneur we need to be prepared to hustle hard and need to have first-hand failure experience.\n\nCBInsights compiled the list of startup failure post-mortems, after studying many startups against certain failure post-mortem points and concluded that , One \u2014 there is rarely one reason for a single startup\u2019s failure. And two \u2014 across all these failures, the reasons are very diverse. They listed 20 reasons for startup not able to succeed out of which we will discuss Top 5 relevant reasons which results to startup failures based on my personal experience and the reserach CBinsights team came up with.\n\n\u201cPricing is a dark art when it comes to startup success and startup post-mortems highlight this difficulty in pricing a product was not too high or too low to make money in context of the particular costs of a company. Delight IO saw this struggle in multiple ways, writing, \u201cOur most expensive monthly plan was US$300. Customers who churned never complained about the price. We just didn\u2019t deliver up to their expectation. We originally price by the number of recording credits. Since our customers had no control on the length of the recordings, most of them were very cautious on using up the credits. Plans based on the accumulated duration of recordings make much more sense for us and the number of subscription showed.\u201d\n\nThere is no denying the fact the success ratio for any startup or small businesses are 1 out of 10, but still the success of 1 startup should be an inspiration for any entrepreneur to give it a try, there will always be an option to pivot and try news way of doing a business, failures are inevitable but that experiences will play a vital role in shaping you as an individual and will prepare you for much bigger risk and even bigger rewards .\n\nDo share if you find my experiences and contribution worth reading and sharing.

        "text": "In continuation today we will understand blockchain implementation as Smart contracting and basics of ethereum as smart contracting mechanism\n\nSmart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1996. Nick Szabo, realised that the decentralised ledger could be used for smart contracts, otherwise called self-executing contracts, blockchain contracts, or digital contracts. In this format, contracts could be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain.\n\nSmart contracts have been used primarily in association with cryptocurrencies. The most prominent smart contract implementation is the Ethereum blockchain platform, which also calls them decentralised applications or dapps.\n\nSome of the popular mechanism for smart contract implementations are\n\n3. Ripple (Codius) : It\u2019s a smart oracle which uses Google Native Client for code sanboxing. When two people transact, they could write the terms of their transactions into code, but neither of them might trust the other to run it.Codius allows a third party to run it and attest to the integrity of the exact code it received. Unfortunately this mode of smart contract has discontinued and is no more being used in practise,\n\nRipple Labs, maintainer of the digital currency Ripple, has announced it will not continue the development of its smart contract project nearly a year after it was announced, saying the \u201csmall and nascent decentralization market\u201d is too immature.\n\n4. Automated Transactions : is another turing complete smart contract language, used in cryptocurrencies like Burstcoin and Qora.\n\nProcess Involved In Smart Contract : When we execute transaction as smart contract between 2 nodes as peer to peer network, there are 3 general steps involved.\n\n2. Agreeing on the precise code that will be run. In practice, parties would usually build their contract from widely used configurable contract modules. Once the contract is agreed upon, it is very important to ensure that the same code actually ends up being executed. See sections Deterministic Compilation and Unique Secret and Key Pair.\n\n3. Executing the code in a trustworthy manner. The code must be run by an impartial third party or by a group of independent entities that are highly unlikely to collude. Smart contracts can also be used without ever actually executing the code; see the section on Offline Contracts for more details on this use case.\n\nUltimately the benefits of using smart contracts instead of traditional contracts come from the increased speed, efficiency, and trust that the contract will be executed exactly as agreed.\n\nIn the series of Blockchain Technology next i will elaborate more on practical Implementation of Smart Contract and it\u2019s programmatic Implementation"

        "text": "Blockchain or, more precisely, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is currently one of the hot topics specially in financial sector. Originally blockchain was segregated as block chain where blocks holds the list of digital records which are secured using encryption technology(Cryptography).\n\nBlockchain is a shared, distributed ledger which helps in processing any digital transaction over the business network and tracks the tangible or intangible assets involved that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. Asset can be tangible \u2014 a house, a car, cash, land \u2014 or intangible like intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, or branding. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\n\nA blockchain by itself is just a data structure defining how the data is stored and logically put together. Every block in a chain can be considered as a pages in a book, where every page has text and also the meta-data which tells the title , chapter number , page no\n\nThat is, how data is logically put together and stored. Other data structures are databases (rows, columns, tables), text files, comma separated values (csv), images, lists, and so on. You can think of a blockchain competing most closely with a database.\n\nTransaction data is permanently recorded in files called blocks. They can be thought of as the individual pages of a city recorder\u2019s recordbook (where changes to title to real estate are recorded) or a stock transaction ledger. Blocks are organized into a linear sequence over time (also known as the block chain). New transactions are constantly being processes by miners into new blocks which are added to the end of the chain and can never be changed or removed once accepted by the network (although some software will remove orphaned blocks).\n\nLet us first understand what is Bitcoin : It\u2019s a digital cryptocurrency now accepted worldwide specially in digital payment systems. The Digital currency (Bitcoin)uses a system which is peer-to-peer, and where transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was first invented by a Satoshi Nakamoto as an open source technology released in 2009\n\nBitcoin Blocks are files where data pertaining to the Bitcoin network is permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent Bitcoin transactions that have not yet entered any prior blocks. Thus a block is like a page of a ledger or record book. Each time a block is \u2018completed\u2019, it gives way to the next block in the blockchain. A block is thus a permanent store of records which, once written, cannot be altered or removed.\n\nThe best example to understand blockchain will be to find how it resolves double spending problem in financial transaction. The simplest way to think of blockchain is as a large distributed ledger of sorts that stores records of transactions. This \u201cledger\u201d is replicated hundreds of times throughout the public network so it is available to everyone. Every time a transaction occurs, it is updated in ALL of these replicated ledgers, so everyone can see it.\n\nEvery time a new transaction is initiated, a block is created with the transactions details and broadcast to all the nodes. Every block carries a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block in the chain, to help establish a sequence of events. Once the authenticity of the transaction is established, that block is linked to the previous block, which is linked to the previous block, creating a chain called blockchain. This chain of blocks is replicated across the entire network, and all cryptographically secured which makes it not only challenging, but almost impossible to hack.\n\nTechnical Implementation of Blockchain with programmatic perspective will be covered in my next article of Blockchain series"

        "title": "Machine Learning Part 3 : Logistic Regression \u2013",
        "text": "Writing this series of Machine Learning has really been great learning experience for me so far , in my last article Machine Learning: What & Why Part 2 we covered the types of ML Algorithms Viz. Supervised & Unsupervised and further went deeper to understand the supervised learning algorithm, in continuation to the same today we will further decode how Binary Classification(Classifications In Supervised Learning) algos work and can be put to practical implementation to make some amazing predictions.\n\nAs covered in my previous article:\n\nIn supervised learning we already know what we are trying to infer, answer scenarios we are searching are known(found in past or completed data) the intent here is to deduce a model(Mechanism)where our machine can find the answers which are not known based on known set of data inputs and known outcomes, this data sets goes into machine, with inputs and outputs (the answers), and let it learn from the relationships between them.\n\nIn our ML Part 2 we discussed the basics of Binary classification and its types , today we will continue from where we left\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables. To represent binary / categorical outcome, we use dummy variables. You can also think of logistic regression as a special case of linear regression when the outcome variable is categorical, where we are using log of odds as dependent variable. In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function.\n\nLogistic regression was developed by statistician David Cox in 1958. This binary logistic model is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features). It allows one to say that the presence of a risk factor increases the probability of a given outcome by a specific percentage.\n\nLike all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.\n\nIt\u2019s being used in Healthcare , Social Sciences & various ML for advanced research & analytics.\n\nTRISS : Trauma & Injury Severity Score, which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd et al. using logistic regression. Many other medical scales used to assess severity of a patient have been developed using logistic regression.\n\nType of questions that a logistics regression can examine.\n\nHow does the probability of getting lung cancer (yes vs. no) change for every additional pound of overweight and for every pack of cigarettes smoked per day?\n\nDo body weight calorie intake, fat intake, and participant age have an influence on heart attacks (yes vs. no)? The major assumptions are:\n\nThat the outcome must be discrete, otherwise explained as, the dependent variable should be dichotomous in nature (e.g., presence vs. absent);\n\nBinary logistic regression is estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), unlike linear regression which uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. MLE is an iterative procedure, meaning that it starts with a guess as to the best weight for each predictor variable (that is, each coefficient in the model) and then adjusts these coefficients repeatedly until there is no additional improvement in the ability to predict the value of the outcome variable (either 0 or 1) for each case\n\nMost often, we would want to predict our outcomes as YES/NO (1/0).\n\nIs your favorite football team going to win the match today? \u2014 yes/no (0/1)\n\nThe logistic function is given by:\n\nThe sigmoid function gives an \u2018S\u2019 shaped curve.\n\nThis curve has a finite limit of:\n\nThe output of sigmoid function when x=0 is 0.5\n\nThus, if the output is more tan 0.5 , we can classify the outcome as 1 (or YES) and if it is less than 0.5 , we can classify it as 0(or NO) .\n\nFor example: If the output is 0.65, we can say in terms of probability as:\n\n\u201cThere is a 65 percent chance that your favorite foot ball team is going to win today \u201d .\n\nThus the output of the sigmoid function can not be just used to classify YES/NO, it can also be used to determine the probability of YES/NO.\n\nSome More Example for Logistic Regression :\n\nHistorically, the first application of logistic regression was \"given a certain dose of poison, how likely is this pest to die?\"\n\nOther applications that are pretty common:\n\nLife insurance actuaries use logistic regression to predict, based on given data on a policy holder (e.g. age, gender, results from a physical examination) the chances that the policy holder will die before the term of the policy expires.\n\nPolitical campaigns try to predict the chances that a voter will vote for their candidate (or do something else desirable, such as donate to the campaign).\n\nIn the next part of the Machine Learning we will learn how logistics regression works programmatically using Python & R language."

        "text": "Thanks all for appreciating and encouraging me for my last article Machine Learning : What & Why ? which has inspired me to pen this second part in this series of AI & ML , hope your claps will keep coming.\n\nMachine Learning(Revisited) is a Red hot cake in the intellectual & scientific world right now. Where the human intelligence is collaborating with this powerful machines to create some wonderful solutions for the problems which are futuristic and realistic too. The magical prediction this stream of AI can do is really mind-boggling . Again to put context in picture i would like to quote Arthur Samuel who was way ahead of time in coining this world Machine Learning\n\nHe gave the most simplified definition of Machine Learning and said \u201c It\u2019s a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\u201d\n\nThere is one very famous theory called Bait Shyness where Rodents learn to avoid the foods which they feel will harm them. Excerpt from the book : understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms will give you the clear picture about this theory\n\nSimilarly our machine learns based on large data sets which we can call as Experience(E) or can say memorising the data sets, this approach works but is not reliable to make right predictions, inorder to make more effective decisions machines needs to be more intelligent to adapt itself to the new sets of data apart from old data sets(E) . Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David mentioned in their book \u201cWhile human learners can rely on common sense to filter out random meaningless learning conclusions, once we export the task of learning to a machine, we must provide well defined crisp principles that will protect the program from reaching senseless or useless conclusions. The development of such principles is a central goal of the theory of machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe most simplest way to understand ML and putting it into action in our project is to segregate it into different branches. The techies who works in this stream are familiar with the main categorisation as : Supervised & Unsupervised Learning. I have covered the basics of the same in my previous article. Lets operate this terminology deeply to further understand it.\n\nIn supervised learning we already know what we are trying to infer, answer scenarios we are searching are known(found in past or completed data) the intent here is to deduce a model(Mechanism)where our machine can find the answers which are not known based on known set of data inputs and known outcomes, this data sets goes into machine, with inputs and outputs (the answers), and let it learn from the relationships between them.\n\nIn the supervised settings we have some information attached to each observation called labels and we want to learn from it, and predict it for observations without labels. These labels are classified\n\nBased on the prediction we can classify supervised learning problems as\n\nClassification problems deals with the discrete set of goals with finite set of possible values. One of the most common classification problems is using Binary Classification\n\nBinary Classification : In this type of classification the output has only 2 possibilities True/False, Red/White or Rat/Cat etc\u2026\n\nMulti-Class Classification : Here we can have more than two possible targets like car types, car\u2019s model , color\u2019s etc which we call as Multi-class classification. Typically each experiment can have one Label , but in some situation any observation can be allocated multiple values.\n\nLets try to understand Binary classification model under supervised learning .\n\nTypes of Binary classification : Among the various techniques of solving binary classification problems here are the few which we will cover\n\nWe will dig deep into the algorithms , the technical tools & libraries which will help you understand ML further, in our next series Machine Learning : What & Why Part3"

        "text": "In this era of digital revolutions data is floating in trillions and billions , but to tap data and convert them into a meaningful information we need to feed them into a computer and analyse it at length and breadth. In-order to harness the power of data sets , Arthur Samuel in 1959 coined the world Machine Learning\n\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the Machine Learning field: \u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\u201d This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.\n\nMachine Learning is a key finding in this digital evolution & it\u2019s undoubtedly going to shape the future of how organisations & a nations will make decisions. The volume and the scale at which we human beings are generating information , it becomes really important that this ML a branch of AI takes the responsibility to predict where we the most powerful creation of this mother earth (Human Being) are heading to. Our computers are no more used for only simple calculations they are capable of processing peta bytes of data in seconds , so ML algos when supplemented with right set of data can be a game changer for sectors like manufacturing , healthcare , auto industries, Banking & financial , Science\n\nit\u2019s the basis for features in everyday apps like search functionality in Google Photos or Apple Photos, wherein ML can differentiate locations, people, and time of day without any written information.\n\nIn Unsupervised ML, no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\n\nUnsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.\n\nThe goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.\n\n: Neural Network :Among neural network models, the self-organizing map (SOM) and adaptive resonance theory (ART) are commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms.\n\n: Data Security : Behavioral-based detection in network security has become a good application area for a combination of supervised- and unsupervised-machine learning.\n\n3. Reinforcement ML : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent. The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.\n\nBetween supervised and unsupervised learning is semi-supervised learning, where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Transduction is a special case of this principle where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing.\n\nProblems where you have a large amount of input data (X) and only some of the data is labeled (Y) are called semi-supervised learning problems.\n\nMachine Learning algorithms is being used currenlty in many areas of reserach like"

        "text": "From the day we were born , we had some amazing , amusing and some terrifying dreams flashing in our powerful memory, it made us cry , it made us laugh and gave us some nerve wrecking moments and a shy of relief when we found it was Just a DREAM .\n\nWhile we grew from kindergarten to higher education our dreams changed and most of them were full of anxious moments where were always found ourself trapped in a fear of losing out on something.\n\nMost of the decisions till this stage are mostly influenced by our family & friends , we have no clue whatsoever what we want to become or what are our options. In this 21st century we are bombarded with lots of choices around us, making it even more difficult to make clear decisions for ourself , Barry Schwartz in his book \u201c The Paradox Of Choices\u201d has covered this decision making paralysis elaborately. But we have to make our choices right & that is only possible when we dig deeper and enquire ourself, we need to narrow down our options & find our Dream(Vision) to pursue, to chase until we reach there . This decision to chose you career goals should be taken by you and only you , Its your goal , its your dream which you want to live forever , so what if you fail , you go wrong , you need to back yourself , take accountability , take the pain because the fruit will be more sweeter if your investments are based on your strength, your weakness and your interest which makes you feel fulfilled.\n\nTOOLS TO FIND YOUR \u201c DREAM COME TRUE MOMENT\u201d -\n\nHere is you 4D\u2019s Sutra which when applied while you are about to decide your destiny can help you have a dream run in your journey going forward\n\nIt\u2019s of utmost importance that you don\u2019t take decision based on what your parents think is good for you , or in the influence of your elders siblings career , or what your friends think will be good based on some random guesses. Do your homework , spend some time with yourself , see what is that you are really best at , are you good at sports , do you like arts , or you have gifted voice , or you love writing , or you love travelling , or your love helping pupils etc etc. May be you are good at academics, love solving puzzles , science is something which comes to your naturally ,You love numbers , you must talk to yourself , Ask array of questions , take your time and make a decision which your conscious allows. In todays scenarios every choice pays back when done with more heart & little head.\n\nWith clear decision, we again need to decide which Road to take . When we walk on the road we very often get multiple direction at the circle , again we have to decide which direction to move on , this act of making direction choices is called all about finding your PURPOSE. Every few steps you put forward, you will be a kind of perplexed with the array of choices , it\u2019s your PURPOSE , Which will direct you , guide you in your journey towards the ultimate LIBERATION.\n\nD3. DEDICATION : To keep You Going\n\nWhen you have made the conscious decision to chase your dream(Goal/Destiny) and found your purpose as a guide , you need to remember that there will be some testing moments where you will feel you are going no where and would be willing to succumb under the expectations, would be willing to Give Up, in that moment you need to go through a LITMUS TEST which will test your commitment , your conviction , your character will be put under extreme stress , but you can easily pass though this moments if You have \u201cRock Solid DEDICATION\u201d.\n\nRemember the purpose why you started off , think about the Dream which you had when you embarked on this direction. Focus on the journey forget the expectations & work on sharpening your tools , your skills which will give required strength to keep you going.\n\nD4. DESTINATION : To Reach & Again Dream Big from There On.\n\nYou cant simply keep walking blindly on the road if you don\u2019t know where you are heading to. You need to have a clear DESTINATION, a clear Goal to achieve. If you have chosen your all 3 D\u2019s wisely you will find your destiny within your reach. But here is a catch when you are about to attain to your destiny , and when you will be a inch closer to achieve it , you will find that your journey has just begun, you again need to revisit all the 3D\u2019s to find your new Destination , your new goal to attain to , thats the beauty of life that the beauty of being human\n\nFind Your Ultimate Destination: From Where You will Have 2 Go Nowhere-\n\nBeing a human being is a rare blessings , we need to learn all the alphabets apart from this 4D\u2019s to make our life worth living. The ultimate one letter world which everyone of has to find while we are performing our duties is Liberation\n\nThis is the first of the #Work4Liberation Series where intention is help and guide the confused soul so that they are well equipped to find their dream journey to walk upon, where fulfilment is not the concern where the ultimate LIBERATION is the bigger Goal."

        "text": "When any organisation/startup comes into existence & decides to embark on this mystical journey with some immensely talented individuals , the most important questions which everyone in the organisation should care & discuss about is , Why we all as a combined entity exist ? what\u2019s the purpose of our existence as an organisation and as an individual for that matter ? what\u2019s that urging us everyday to gather at common place and perform our duties without failing ? is it the money ? or is it the well being of your near and dear ones or is it the happiness we extract from whatever work we do, is it learning new things which excites you , is it helping others ? We need to enquire repeatedly , it may be hard to find answer as we have not been groomed like that to even think about why we even exist with this powerful intellectual brain , but questioning is the only way out .\n\nHaving a purpose of your own guides you in right direction, pushes you out of your comfort zone , it helps you fight procrastination , it gives you a powerful tool to improve yourself everyday, it urges you to learn from every dimension of your life, it inspires you to act fearlessly and take risk, it gives you the required strength to stand up in your moments of failures. It increases your appetite to achieve more, to be more precise it helps you to be you.\n\nIf you are a Business in making you can\u2019t sustain without understanding the purpose of being into service of others. Its should be more about how your product & services being rendered is changing your customers/users life meaningfully. If it\u2019s not about them, mind it, you may thrive somehow but you may never grow . If as a company you are more concerned about your Bottom Line or Topline , you are more driven by short-term purpose , but to be in the business for long-term you need to define what you really stand for ?. As an entity you are not only in the business of making profits, your purpose should be , how you utilise your resources to create an impact in the life of the people associated in your organisation , so that the entire team feels well equipped to build a product adding values to their customers life.\n\nWell there is a spiritual dimension which has the solution for you, but it not comes easy to everyone. But If you really care about finding your purpose , you should first accept that the world is not perfect and neither the people or any living being for that matter. So in this not so perfect setup we need to find what\u2019s our role play as an individual , we need to understand that there is a inner craving inside every individual which pushes them to act fearlessly, sadly most of this are related to money and we can\u2019t help it , as world around us is built like that and we have to accept it that Money is Important . Only question which here needs to be asked is, to what extent it is useful & if we can answer this puzzle we will certainly be able to find our purpose and live our life accordingly. It\u2019s a fact that if your survival is at stake you can\u2019t talk like a visionary, you can\u2019t live through your life by only being inspired. So our foremost purpose is to ensure that we and our loved ones are well served at first place. And as an intellectual human being it should not be an issue unless you are lazy guy who just want to crawl like a warm on this earth , waiting to get all by giving nothing. Once your survival is taken care off, you can explore the infinite dimensions of being intellectual human being, you can explore what\u2019s that keeps you going tirelessly , what\u2019s the best asset you have to give to the society , it should be more about how to be at the service of others. If you can find your true meaning/purpose of existence you will live well and help others live well too."

It\u2019s because you have the realization that you have the limitless capabilities to make you and your surrounding (ex. Workplace)blissful and congenial enough to be at your supreme best. So now when we know what it is required to pull the best out of ourselves, Why can\u2019t we love our work and workplace without making long faces ? It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t wan\u2019t to perform your duties well, it\u2019s because you are not living your life well and so you are not able to be in a right state, to be in love with your work and workplace which has to be the case as our entire life circles around our work when we venture into professional world.\n\nWork which should give you immense pleasure, which takes care of your day to day survival is giving you nightmares. Work and workplace is the creation of our own, we have chosen to be here & perform our duties, so when we have made a choice consciously, we can even choose to back our decision with conviction, but we are ignorant to our own reality and basing our decision on some kind of expectations which is even not ours , which has been stimulated by external factors. We try to extract pleasure engaging ourself in activities which is not sourced by us, but by some xyz being which may even not be present around us to bother. What if we understand the fact that whatever good or bad has to happen to us can only be sourced by us and based on that realization we make a choice that: no matter what the results are, we will accept with open heart, improve everyday, learn from our mistakes & create a surrounding which is nothing less than a bliss to live & let others live.\n\nOne things which can definitely transform the way you live your life is , Accepting that you know nothing about the whole creations, and that\u2019s why you are here you to enquire as a true seeker, whose hunger is to know more and achieve more as a human being. Don\u2019t limit yourself by being a believer, instead be a seeker always, longing for more, learning from every dimension of your life , even appreciating the creatures who are not as blessed as we human beings are, learn from every situation possible without identifying yourself to anything. Yes it\u2019s possible to be a true seeker, It\u2019s just we doubt our capabilities way too much without questioning ourself very often. Start questioning yourself and answers will be right there to find\n\nWithin this realization go out and create something beautiful & meaningful out your blissed life.\n\nThanks for being there and reading\u2026.. if you loved what i shared , do feel free to clap and share this with your fellow beings and inspire me and others too."

        "text": "As per GSMA report , the number of mobile subscribers in India will cross 500 million this year . The pace with which this numbers are adding up, India will be the fastest growing mobile first population by coming 5 years. GSMA forecasts that India will have three-quarters of a billion mobile subscribers by 2020 as mobile phones get into the hands of more than half the population.That\u2019s the brighter side of the game which fascinates us a lot but there is one more important aspect which GSMA has brought\n\nLets talk about the remaining Pie of 64 % and dissect these numbers to explore the opportunity and the challenges in connecting those to the growing league of population who are called the smart generation connected with smartphone.There lies an opportunity in adversity and it goes well with this stat. Being an optimist technologist i would like the reaming 64% also to be a part of this connected population, though it seems challenging but considering the digital India initiative i can see there is a lot of headroom for faster growth in this mobile connected population in coming years ahead.\n\nEven though Indian mobile operators have rolled out 3G internet services in almost all the major states still only 11% of the mobile connection are 3G enabled and that's a bigger challenge to bring the remaining 89 % of the mobile subscribers to 3G network . Considering large part of those mobile subscribers are living in remote areas this becomes even more challenging.\n\nAlasdair Grant, Head of Asia, GSMA feels As the ecosystem moves from just voice and data to a full fledged digital economy, in which mobile internet is the fundamental platform for delivery of services , the concern is that the people who are still on 2G will not be able to participate in this economy,\u201d\n\nSo strategy for smooth transformation from 2G network to 3G for the mobile users is a must and for that Indian mobile operators and govt agency has to work transparently with clear policy in place . They have to work for empowering users not empowering themselves, doing so will generate revenue for both stakeholders and also enable a greater opportunity for the mobile user too.\n\nThe Indian govt has to work closely with private and public , national and international players who are responsible for providing Internet services to the population to transform the country into a digitally powered society and economy, ensuring high-quality, widely available and affordable mobile broadband . The penetration of internet specially into the remote area where population do have a mobile phone but they are not so privileged to be connected to the world over the internet, must be the highest priority for the stakeholders and policymakers. Digital India mission should frame the policy which covers the rural population which are yet to experience the mobile and PPP model has to work with selfless intention to connect those bigger pie and bring them into the privileged league. Enable and empower them also to be a part of digitally connected world economy where they can share photos , transfer money , book bus and trains over the phone ans most importantly make all the information accessible to them which are relevant to their daily earnings so that they can earn more and have larger participation in economic growth of the country.\n\nThis not yet connected generation which drives our economy in larger way through their conventional wisdom if empowered with internet ready mobile phones our country will not only be the fastest growing mobile first population , but also it will be fastest growing economy which generates lots of opportunity for other growing world economies to invest in India and ensure they are doubling and tripping their currency. Any country which is going to be at the center-stage driving the world will be INDIA considering the potential our connected youth will showcase by this small yet extremely powerful tool called Mobile.\n\nWe need to be more inclusive and if we can think of connecting the 100% of our population to this information age we will be simply \u201cUNSTOPPABLE\u201d"
