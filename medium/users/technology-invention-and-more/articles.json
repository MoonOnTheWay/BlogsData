        "text": "Earlier this week Tesla Motors posted a video of a fully-autonomous drive from a Los Altos Safeway to Tesla\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters. The video is sped up 3\u20134x with the catchy (and licensed?) Paint it Black by the Rolling Stones.\n\nYou can see that video on this page.\n\nMore informative, however, is this version that attempts to show the trip in real time (though it still feels a little too fast to me).\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on here, and I\u2019d be interested in seeing a version that\u2019s 4K, includes input from all the cameras, and runs around 10 fps. There are a few hiccups here and there \u2014 I won\u2019t list them because they\u2019ll be discussed at length elsewhere \u2014 but overall it\u2019s an impressive demonstration. There we are few times where the car seemed to stop for unknown reason (not near an intersection or an evident obstacle), which would concern me if someone was following too close.\n\nUpdate: In this version below, someone has taken the medium range forward camera output and put it in front of the driver:\n\nOn a personal note, it always blows my mind that this is being developed right on my doorstep. The video starts 5 miles from my house!"

        "text": "It\u2019s an often repeated question \u2014 I heard a lot of people left X and joined Y, is that true? Is Y the hottest company right now? The answers are often anecdotal - a friend of a friend moved from X to Y last month, or a long list of subjective rants on the internet about X or Y. The data is usually outdated, some of the popular search results refer to pre-IPO Facebook. How can one find an answer that is grounded in data and up to date?\n\nThe most straightforward thing to do is to find out the raw number of employees who migrated from X to Y. Finding the exact number is obviously very hard, but a good approximation can be found using LinkedIn advanced search which allows you to set current company and previous company as filters. For example, using LinkedIn advanced search reveals the number of employees at Uber who worked at Facebook before\n\nAnd the migration in the opposite direction\n\nBut comparing the raw numbers moving from X to Y can be misleading as it depends on the relative sizes of X and Y. Large companies will have a large number of employees leaving, as well as joining them.\n\nWe fix the problem in comparing migration volumes by normalizing them by the number of employees of the previous company. This gives us the probability of migration from X to Y. It is the ratio of the number of employees at Y who worked at X before, compared to the current employees at X. Below are sample queries:\n\nSo the probability of migrating from Google to Apple is higher than the probability of migrating from Apple to Google! Using this as a metric to measure migration seems counter intuitive to the employee satisfaction surveys. The problem is Apple simply has lot more people, so the denominator is large and that drives down the migration probability to any particular company. So this metric doesn\u2019t appear that useful as it favors companies with large number of employees.\n\nWe can try to fix the problem with migration probability by trying a different normalization instead \u2014 comparing the fraction of employees at X who came from Y. This is the migrant density of X at Y, computed as the fraction of employees at Y who worked at X before. For example,\n\nSo may be Uber has an edge over Microsoft, but this metric seems rather unfair to Microsoft. It\u2019s easy to make up a large fraction at a small company. This metric now favors small companies too much.\n\nOne way to balance this opposing tension between big and small companies is to compute an adaptation of lift scores. Lift scores measure the strength of a signal over a naturally occuring value. From the above example, since Microsoft is a large company, it\u2019ll naturally make up a significant population of any smaller tech company. The lift score measures whether at any company, the fraction of ex-Microsoft employees is larger than the expected value.\n\nFor example, one can compute the lift of migration from Microsoft to Google as\n\nThis computes the extra \u201clift\u201d of migration from Microsoft to Google, compared to all the migration to Google that would have taken place anyway.\n\nThe table below shows lift scores for migrations within Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Uber.\n\nThe graph below is a sorted view of the migration lift.\n\nCaveat for the analysis is that data gets stale, please refresh the inputs when looking at the results beyond 2016."

        "text": "I\u2019m Denny Pell, and that was the year I changed my last name to Dorito. Legally. Because I could. I was a newly-minted lawyer then. And I liked the word. I liked filing the papers.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve always liked the popular snack food, I was more interested in its origin, from the Mexican-Spanish \u2018doradito\u2019 or \u2018golden boy.\u2019 I was fresh out of law school and on my way to make my fortune, and this name, I thought, would be good luck.\n\nThe change got me into trouble fast. No one would take me seriously. I should have expected that. Dating was a nightmare. Women were reluctant to hold my hand for fear that I would turn their fingers orange.\n\nMy first name is actually Eldon, or \u2018Denny\u2019 to my friends and throughout my school years. Now I chose to resurrect my other nickname, the one my father had given me in childhood, \u2018El.\u2019 When jokes about snack foods rose to a fever pitch, I took to calling myself \u2018El Dorito.\u2019 This suggested the mythical Mexican town, \u2018El Dorado.\u2019 That helped.\n\nSoon, everyone just called me \u2018El.\u2019\n\nI needed my \u2018pay dirt\u2019 case, one that would set me up for life, and allow me the time and resources to take on the pro bono cases and do the Lord\u2019s good work. Unfortunately, all the tobacco and air bag and asbestos cases had been taken on by the big firms.\n\n\u201cNeil Young got away with murder,\u201d I told a friend I\u2019d taken the bar exam with. \u201cI intend to see him pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cShot his baby. Down by the river. Then wrote a song about it, and played it for all the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Jimi Hendrix? Didn\u2019t he shoot his old lady down?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Young is still alive. I can make a career on that. And Hendrix didn\u2019t actually shoot his old lady, the song was an interview with someone named \u2018Joe,\u2019 he did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich made him an accessory, right? Because of the knowledge he had of the homicide? If he did nothing about it. And there\u2019s nothing in that song to say that he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Jimi Hendrix is still dead, and what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d\n\nBefore long, I rented a Malibu and was on my way to the little town in the Heart of the South where he shot her. The entire town was a living tribute to the guy and the song \u2018Down by the River.\u2019 The song in which Young confessed to the crime. And for which I was determined he would pay. Not criminally, although why he was never arrested and charged for that bothered me.\n\nNo, I was going for the civil case. Wrongful death. There\u2019d be a settlement in that.\n\nIn the early 1970s when the song came out, the town changed its name to Rivertown. To this day, the town is frozen in that time. It\u2019s a college town, home to Rivertown Polytech. Many of the residents wear plaid flannel shirts, jeans, and work boots. Many of the men wear their hair shoulder length, parted in the middle, and some of the women look like Joni Mitchell did back then. Young and old alike. Not Neil Young, actually \u2018young.\u2019 The old dress like this because they\u2019re frozen in time and know nothing else. The younger do because they know nothing else, either.\n\nThe streets are named for Jackson Browne and Richie Havens and members of Crazy Horse and the Eagles and Carlos Santana\u2019s band. And all five of the Jacksons. The Jacksons back then. There are only four now.\n\nThe people in Rivertown were noticeably thinner than people are anywhere else. They smoke everywhere, some wear puka-shell necklaces, almost everyone a bracelet braided from string or rawhide. The gas stations sell no snacks. They weren\u2019t known for that yet. I found Doritos for sale at a corner grocery, but they were the pointy-type, and just the original corn flavor. Just like when Neil Young first played here, at the Student Union. He put seventeen grand in the pocket of his jeans for the night\u2019s work. Those were 1971 dollars, BTW, about 100 thousand bucks today. And, Nacho Cheese was not yet widely available then. Even Neil Young couldn\u2019t have bought a bag of those no matter how much he had in his pocket. This guy who shot his baby.\n\nOn the sidewalk outside the storefront with a plate-glass window lettered \u2018Black Panther Party\u2019 were several milk crates, an ashtray on one, but no one was around.\n\nI paused there on my tour of the town, and thought about how handy milk crates were.\n\nThen I noticed that the crate with the ashtray had five, maybe six of what looked like ankle monitors in a little heap. The bands had been modified with a clasp for easy on and off. The plastic housing could be opened from the top, into which a Zippo lighter was shown to fit in place of the electronics. A hangtag on each read \u2018Donation $5.\u2019 Below, in small print, it read \u2018Lighter Not Included.\u2019\n\nRivertown is in the South, in the \u2018Heart of the South.\u2019 The South is the only place in the country that has a Heart. The only place with any anatomical reference, really. There\u2019s no \u2018Belly of the North\u2019 or \u2018Legs of the West.\u2019 There\u2019s even a Deep South. No other place has a \u2018Deep.\u2019 There\u2019s no \u2018Deep Southwest\u2019 or \u2018Deep New England.\u2019 That I know of.\n\nThere was a music store in town that advertised guitar lessons in the window. There was a picture of one of Neil Young\u2019s Stratocasters. Beneath that, \u2018You\u2019ll Solo in One Day.\u2019\n\nI always wanted to play the guitar, but really went in because the promise in this advertisement was clearly a hoax. And maybe I could make a career on that, too. Grab these people up into some class action.\n\n\u201cOne day to solo?\u201d I asked the hawk-faced man behind the counter sorting 8-track tapes into milk crates stacked along the back wall.\n\n\u201cOne day. Most are good to go in one afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can that be? How can I solo in one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ll teach you to play like Neil Young.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ll learn the solo from \u2018Down by the River.\u2019 And it\u2019s just one note. Mostly. At some point, there\u2019s two. Two notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there. You just said it. If I recall the solo, there\u2019s a couple of them, notes, you know? He does wander off into certainly one other note, and then a few more. So you\u2019re saying you can teach me all that in one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other note, the other major one, and those few more you mention. That used to be the Advanced Solo Class. But now we include it. People learn faster now. We throw that in at the end of the main class. We used to charge for it. But now it\u2019s included. No charge.\u201d\n\nI noticed the poster on the wall above the milk crates. It too said \u2018No Charge.\u2019 For guitar lessons \u2018for any Wounded Warrior.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll teach you a good solo,\u201d he went on, \u201cAn honest riff, not showy, self-aggrandizing, and masturbatory like so many guitar rides are. In that song, he\u2019s alone with his thoughts and feelings and invites the listener to be, too. That\u2019s what \u2018solo\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems pointed, abrupt . . . almost angry, that stark, staccato pace and tone.\u201d\n\nKind of what you\u2019d expect, I thought, from a guy who\u2019d just shot his baby.\n\n\u201cAs said, your thoughts and feelings,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just teach guitar here, we work to make you a better person. Here, put this on.\u201d\n\nHe handed me a vintage black Gibson Les Paul. It slung low, comfortably, in a way I didn\u2019t even know I liked, but I did. And I don\u2019t even play guitar.\n\nMy left hand found the neck, my fingers the strings. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . I\u2019m . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like I know what people are feeling. Like what you\u2019re feeling right now. That you\u2019re kind of . . . is it happy? For me? It\u2019s . . . \u2018empathy,\u2019 if I had to come up with a\n\nLater, I was on my way back to my hotel. It was down at the end of Lonely Street. But I missed the fork in the road. As I rounded a curve and the building came into view, I stood both feet on the brakes of the rental car. I knew that facade, the late deco style of the soaring glass and aluminum entrance and the glazed, blond brick of the exterior.\n\nI remembered my father\u2019s accounts of the Congressional hearings in which he, Carter Pell, intern to Senator John Tower, had participated. I remembered nothing of what he told me about the hearings other than one of the exhibits, a photo of the \u2018UXB, Inc.\u2019 plant which Dad had framed and hung on a wall in our living room. And this was the building I was now stopped in front of in that sharp light of a late afternoon in the Deep South.\n\nIt happens that the main industry in Rivertown had been UXB, Inc., a company which was years later found to have supplied unexploding bombs to the Vietnam war effort. It occurred to some at the time that you couldn\u2019t possibly drop what would amount to 7 \u00bd million tons of bombs on a country the size of Vietnam and still be losing the war. A lot of these had to be duds. Something Senator Tower was keenly interested in exploring in his subcommittee hearings.\n\nTurns out that as the antiwar movement was ratcheting up, inside the government a secret antiwar group within the Pentagon had decided to mix the unexploding bombs in with the real ones on the advice of sympathizers at the State Department. This way, the citizens could have a source of income after the war, digging the fake bombs up and selling them as collector\u2019s items. The bombs would be substantially real, including gluey packings that mimicked high explosives, and detonators that whirred and ticked when disturbed. This was to keep the disposal units on their toes.\n\nUXB, Inc. even employed an art department, which decorated the non-bombs with chalked outlines of genitalia and epithets in both English and Vietnamese, just like crews on flight lines always do in war.\n\nThe next day I drove my Chevy to the levee.\n\nThe GPS guided me to a place down by the River where, in the song, it had happened. A bronze plaque on a metal post marked the site, a public park named \u2018Down by the River.\u2019\n\nIt was a pleasant place, behind the shady trees. The River was broad here, flowing slowly, its smooth surface dappled by early afternoon sun.\n\nI toyed with the idea of digging the Les Paul and the small portable practice amp I\u2019d purchased with it out of the trunk, and setting up to practice the solo in this setting. Then I heard soft guitar music from an empty, open-air theater nearby.\n\nThere was a young man sitting on the edge of the stage humming along to a song I felt I knew. Alongside him was a young woman. They were a couple, and had left their childhoods behind, not as long ago as I had. They were friendly, and I thought, old-fashioned.\n\nHer hair was curly, short on the sides, long in back, teased bangs piled high in front.\n\nShe said her name was Diane. Diane Cayenne. It was originally Diane Cinnamon. Her mother was the Cinnamon Girl in the song of the same name. And she\u2019d been in the movie Grease. She was a dancer, Diane said.\n\nThe young man held out his hand. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Jack. Jack Suthern.\u201d\n\nAttached to the apron of the stage next to them, and extending out from below it, was an odd set of metal steps. I just had to know what they were. Jack demonstrated the scissoring action by which the steps were extended, then compressed backwards out of the way neatly, when no longer needed.\n\n\u201cI invented them for Diane. She\u2019s always had trouble getting up here,\u201d Jack explained.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cwe used milk crates before, but they were always so . . . wobbly.\u201d\n\nThe young man nodded, \u201cYeah, well, Johnny Mathis sang here last year, and his road manager saw them, so I gave him a set for Johnny\u2019s tour bus. We\u2019ve been getting orders since. . . Kiss, Garth Brooks, Dolly Parton, Cirque du Soleil . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDiane handles the marketing,\u201d Jack grinned, pecking her on the cheek.\n\n\u201cI got Professor Fabre from Poly to translate the instructions into French,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were hung up for days on the word \u2018retractable.\u2019 It seems that\u2019s not a concept the French understand. So we had to go with \u2018extensible.\u2019 Or, shall I say \u2018ex-ten-see-blay.\u2019\n\nBy the look on my face, I was struggling.\n\n\u201cA \u2018thing\u2019 does not retract from a Frenchman,\u201d she said. \u201cHow dare it? They are the center of everything, the French. So, things extend to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now there\u2019s the nasty letter we got from a folding-bleachers manufacturer last week, about, maybe, patent infringement . . .\u201d Jack strummed a few chords softly, looked up, \u201cDo you know a good lawyer, Mr. Dorito?\u201d\n\n\u201cEl is fine, Jack.\u201d I said I did. Then, to my astonishment, I asked if I could join in, making a guitar-playing motion with my hands. Jack was thrilled. I wanted to sling that Gibson low and feel those things I\u2019d felt in the music store. That empathy. And I wanted to solo.\n\nNo sooner did I strap up did I know much more about the quiet ease they shared in each other\u2019s company. It spoke of a long courtship and memories of picnics and rodeos and church choirs and steamy nights on tufted vinyl backseats pawing at the shyness of their shared youth, anointing the end of their innocence with a froth of sweat and fluids.\n\nJack pulled up the leg of his jeans and fished a Zippo out of an ankle bracelet. He lit a cigarette, offered me one. I declined. He took a drag and stuck it, filter-first, under a string near the tuning pegs on his guitar. He never touched it. It burned down to the filter while we played, the way that some guitarists do. I liked that about him. We jammed till after sundown. Me and Jack. And Diane on tambourine.\n\nMilk-crate steps enjoyed a special place in popular RV culture, and for decades had a lock on that market. Ever since John Kennedy selected one to enter and exit his bus in his \u201960 presidential bid. From that moment on, it became the symbol of electoral humility for all candidates, and the first choice for the new owners of RVs in the fledgling motorhome industry. Every RV sold for decades included a milk crate step, which one set out upon parking.\n\nStudents found they were perfect for storing record albums. Long before \u2018branding\u2019 was the holy grail of marketing, some artists \u2018branded\u2019 milk crates just to store their albums. Neil Young had his own line for a while. He called them \u2018Harvest Crates.\u2019 What balls. He got away with that, too.\n\nOf course, community groups had long since found them useful as temporary sidewalk seating, and they were perfect for 8-track storage in retail applications. The milk crate industry would not be hurting long, and soon, new markets and applications developed.\n\nI made a career of representing Jack and Diane and their folding RV stairs company, \u2018The Extensibles.\u2019 With grants from the government, we were able to set up shop in the old UXB plant. We went global.\n\nI\u2019ve spent all these years as a lawyer in Rivertown, which was its name until just recently.\n\nOne day, I was on my way downtown for a meeting with the Black Panthers. I do some pro bono work for them now and then. I support other causes, too.\n\nAnyway, that day there was a long line of cars at the gas station, reminding me of pictures my dad had shown me of the oil crisis of 1973. This time, it wasn\u2019t for gas, but a queue for the charging station. The cars in the line moved silently forward, eerily, as they were all electric.\n\nPeople are known to offer to keep a place in line for a price, and people are known to pay it. The day before, two guys duked it out, and were arrested. Just like in \u201973. People don\u2019t like to wait in line to make their cars go, no matter which century it is.\n\nI was picking my way around the cars, when a guy rolled down his window, \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me where I am? My GPS seems confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re at Main Street and Jermaine,\u201d I said.\n\nThe man mouthed \u2018Jermaine,\u2019 with a puzzled look.\n\n\u201cNo, I mean where. Isn\u2019t this Rivertown?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more. Name was changed last month. By City Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cEktin?! You mean like the city . . . in . . .over in . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNepal? Hah! No, we\u2019re the other Ektin. The American one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOdd name. What does it mean . . . Ektin?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody knows this is nowhere.\u201d"

        "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem with being a Dummy,\u201d Sean told the doctor. \u201cVirgin Thermo. First mold. They can\u2019t take that away from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs someone trying to take that from you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot how I meant that. I\u2019m grateful, in fact. At Lab this morning, they showed the final design. And part number!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful. A part number is everything. It\u2019s passed Engineering, and on to Fab. My weldplast is tomorrow morning, at eight. It\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess how much they weigh.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess. They\u2019re just boobs, after all.\u201d Sean turned up from the couch, \u201cDoctor, that\u2019s a lovely rouge on you.\u201d\n\nSean settled back, proudly, \u201cMy \u2018BAR-34B\u2019 is three pounds, three ounces. And they nailed my Lead Tin Yellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that by adding the assembly I won\u2019t be as-built. I\u2019ll be the only Weldie in the group. But yes, I\u2019m still very comfortable with my decision.\u201d\n\nSean was designed as a frontal impact specialist, wired to measure head-on accelerations, impacts, shear forces and deflections picked up by sensors in her skin.\n\nThat was in the time when Uber and Lyft and taxi drivers had jobs, along with parking-lot attendants and tollbooth operators and traffic cops. That was the time before self-driving cars. Crash test dummies had jobs, too.\n\nAnd after the accelerometers and transducers had been replaced with emotion sensors, Sean woke to feelings, and could sense happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, fear, and anger. Eye-cameras were added along with facial expression recognition software.\n\nIn the process, Sean had skipped the childhood admonitions, the isolation and suffering, and found that in the catalog of human emotions and her reactions to them, she was not who she\u2019d been molded to be.\n\nHe wanted to be a she.\n\nCars no longer crash, injuring or killing their occupants. Now there are emotional hazards. Some become docile from the passive experience of riding, some uncommunicative. Driving is no longer a process, with one person as pilot, an ad-hoc hierarchy with a common goal. Some people continue to \u2018crash\u2019 when self-driven, in way unforeseen in the early days. The media now sensationalizes it, showing private cars disgorging catatonic children, dysfunctional prom dates, mature couples in argument.\n\nRetrofitted with Artificial Intelligence, Sean was among those resurrected as the new crash testers, or \u2018Agents\u2019. Their legacy epicene form and school-bus complexion resonated with the public and lent credibility to the results of the tests in which they were now being used.\n\nIn place of Agent\u2019s forms being hurled into dashboards and windshields, there were now slow-motion head bobs, expressions of comprehension from newly motive lips, cartoon eyes winking and the occasional thin, if plasticky, grin.\n\nThe \u2018Agency\u2019 was making great strides managing crashes. Tests with combinations of sub-audible sound loops, subliminal cabin lighting schemes, and vibratory cadences were all showing great promise.\n\n\u201cAnd how do you feel about the other changes?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cShrunk?\u201d Sean twirled an index finger comically around her ear-dent.\n\nSean looked down at her hands. The slight delamination at the tips of her fingers had stopped its progress, thankfully. The techs advised her to watch for aggressive flaking. But this was the price for frontal. Even a crash test dummy could be expected to shield its face now and then.\n\nWhen she inhaled, breathing and a sense of smell being new features in the redesign, there was the faintest hint of plasticizer, and a confluence of old mold-release and brittling resins.\n\nIs this how it begins? Am I defleshing?\n\nTo survive years of crushing impacts, thousands of blows, only to waste away from inside. Just when she was learning to feel.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m human after all.\n\nSean would be the first Agent to have its sexuality changed. She would be the first in a new class: Hybrid VII 1st Female-Regen. The counseling was done.

        "title": "Did Turing Prove Machines Will Never Equal Humans? \u2013 Technology, Invention, App, and More \u2013",
        "text": "There is a floating belief that Turing showed a mathematical proof of human superiority over machines. You can see the proof in action in The Changeling episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk forces the evil machine Nomad to self destruct by forcing it into a self loop. In conversations on whether machines will surpass human intelligence, this proof lingers as some kind of a barrier that machines can\u2019t overcome.\n\nA look at the proof first before diving into it\u2019s implications. The proof, known as the Turing halting problem, expressed in mathematical language is quite cut and dry. Ironically machines do lot better at \u201cunderstanding\u201d such proofs than humans. I\u2019ll sacrifice the formalism of the proof to fit it in a five minute read.\n\nThe proof goes like this: when you pose a question to an intelligent machine there are only two possibilities, either it will give you an answer, or it won\u2019t and remain silent forever. Now consider a machine named Ava, which can look at any other machine and tell you whether the other machine will remain silent forever. However, if the other machine will give an answer, then it\u2019s Ava who remains silent forever.\n\nIf you show Ava a machine that is waiting for a clock to show 12:60, or a computer that is trying to compute the final decimal of \u03c0, then Ava will say the machine is stuck forever.\n\nHowever, if you show Ava a machine waiting to ring the bell at 12:00, or a computer trying to add two numbers, it will remain silent till eternity. So far so good, Ava seems to have a clear way to decide what to do when she looks at another machine.\n\nSo what happens when you show Ava the mirror? If Ava looks at herself and decides that she can give an answer, then she must remain silent. However, if she decides that she has to remain silent, then she must answer. As a result Ava will not be able to decide one way or the other.\n\nThe belief in human superiority is based on the fact that no human being while reading this article will end up in an infinite loop. Faced with a situation like that of Ava, humans can decide something is fishy and break out of the indecision loop. Machines can\u2019t. Humans win. Naa nana naa na\u2026\n\nThe main flaw here is to think that detecting the circular reasoning and breaking out of it is some unique skill the human brain posses that machines can\u2019t replicate. It is not. In fact machines are just as good at analyzing the Turing halting problem as humans and machines can prove the undecidability of the halting problem as well. (Small diversion: My friend from college had a T-shirt with a machine generated proof printed at the front. When he subsequently put on a few pounds, we used to joke that he expanded the scope of the proof by eating rice.)\n\nWhat Turing proved, and there are similar results by Russell, Cantor and Godel, has to do with a fundamental limitation in math. Just like Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle in physics proves that certain physical quantities can\u2019t be determined to arbitrary accuracy simultaneously, the undecidability of Turing\u2019s halting problem states that certain mathematical properties can\u2019t be computed. Godel showed that such hairy problems will exist, no matter how advanced your math is. All these results apply equally to anyone carrying out the math, be it man or machine.\n\nSo if you put a human in place of Ava, nothing changes. If forced to decide one way or other, the human will also remain undecided forever. But both the human and Ava can prove that such problem will be undecidable.\n\nAnother closely related misconception in this area is the belief that computers can\u2019t detect infinite loops in computers. Computers are a restricted form of the more general machines that Turing talks about. Computers can detect infinite loops, and in fact do much better than humans in my experience. I spent a few years working on a product that could analyze other programs (similar to the Turing problem setup in concept). While there were practical limitations due to RAM and CPU time, there was no theoretical limitation in detecting whether a given program would loop forever. That\u2019s because all programs have finite state, and the problem with the Turing halting problem is due to infinite states, which is of pure theoretical interest.\n\nSo did Turing believe machines will never surpass humans? Quite the opposite. The famous Turing test proposed by him poses the question as \u201cwhen\u201d machines will surpass humans and not \u201cif\u201d."

        "title": "Googling as a Classifier \u2013 Technology, Invention, App, and More \u2013",
        "text": "Problem Statement: Given the salient words from a blog on medium.com, can you predict the most suitable tag for it? For example, given a blog that talks about \u201csecret to happiness\u201d, can you tell which is the most appropriate tag for it: mystery, motivation or bliss?\n\nAfter working on machine learning for a few years, it\u2019s easy to treat it as the big hammer with which you can nail everything. One way to nail the above problem would be to build a model which classifies blogs to tags using terms from the blogs as features. So the training data would look like\n\nA straightforward way to approach this would be to build word embeddings which transform the terms (or the ngrams) to vectors, and then build a neural net with some hidden layers and a softmax output layer.\n\nBut thats way too much work. In the rest of the article, we will discuss how you can use google.com as your readymade classifier.\n\nWhat kind of a machine learning model can google.com emulate? Obviously not a model which uses gradient descent at it\u2019s core. Our starting point is going to be Naive Bayes which works fairly well for text classification and doesn\u2019t involve any gradient descent loop. The key idea is that you can compute Naive Bayesian parameters using google.com, in fact you can do a little better. Note the basic idea behind Naive Bayes is to compute the conditional probability corresponding to each feature (in our case its the terms from the blogs), while assuming the features are independent.\n\nTo construct our model, we first let go of the simplifying independence assumption. With google.com we can directly compute the joint probabilities of the terms and there is no need to cripple our model with the independence assumption. Our classifier is going to directly compute the conditional probability P(tag | terms), the probability of a tag given a set of terms. The conditional probability can be computed as\n\nTo get the number of blogs on medium that have both the terms and the tag, we google:\n\nTo get the number of blogs that have just the terms we drop the tag from the query:\n\nComputing the conditional probabilities for the different tags, we get:\n\nSo motivation comes out at the winner. Note we didn\u2019t really need to compute the denominator since it\u2019s common across all the scores.\n\nIn hindsight, the solution seems trivial and makes you wonder why we even considered it a machine learning problem. Indeed, there is a whole class of classification problems for which you don\u2019t need to \u201cbuild\u201d any model at all, a simple index is sufficient. Specifically, if you have a classification task where all the features and labels are discrete (or can be effectively reduced to discrete), then all you need to do is build an index with the features and labels as keys. To classify any document, simply query the index with the features and find the most popular label from the matching entries. As long as the query is broad and matches sufficient entries to give you confidence that you are not over fitting, you are in good shape.\n\nFor example, if you are given gender, location, brand preference and foot size of visitors to shoes.com as input features and need to predict the color of sneakers, then you can simply push all the past sales logs to an index like Google Bigquery and fire queries of the form \u201cselect count(*) from \u2026 group by ..\u201d to evaluate the conditional probabilities. In effect you can evaluate the model on the fly without requiring any training.\n\nTo be clear, deep learning is more powerful and can generalize features in a way that index lookups can never match. For instance, with enough training data deep learning can infer \u201csecret to joy\u201d and \u201csecret to happyness\u201d are similar to \u201csecret to happiness\u201d, thereby providing a more general result. We also simplified our problem by assuming we know which are the \u201csalient\u201d words from the blog. Typical machine learning setups can figure that out automatically and you can simply dump all the terms from the blog as input. However, all that power is not always necessary. If you are fine with strict matches to your discrete features, then you can save the time spent in training and maintaining models."

        "title": "CES. Where Marketers Can Check Their Blindspot. \u2013 Technology, Invention, App, and More \u2013",
        "text": "Here I am. Cramped on United 1179 en route to Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show. Again. For the 18th time. Really.\n\nMy first time at CES was way back in 1996 when I worked on the re-launch of Samsung Electronics in the U.S. At the time, we were marketing microwave ovens, \u201cboom boxes,\u201d VCRs and large screen CRT televisions. Times have changed, and so has CES.\n\nOver the course of my career, I\u2019ve been to a lot of trade shows, but there is nothing quite like the behemoth of CES. Every year, it\u2019s bigger, badder and more crowded.\n\nCES started as a simple, necessary idea to bring together manufacturers, customers and the people in between (press, distributors, sales/field forces, etc). It was held in New York City back in June of 1967. According to Wikipedia, there were 17,500 attendees and 100 exhibitors. Last year, there were over 170,000 attendees and 3,600 exhibitors in Las Vegas.\n\nThere are more exhibitors than ever. There are the players you expect, the copycats and the \u201cbarnacles on the boats of innovation\u201d that will manufacture the cheapest accessory for your favorite smartphone (last year we counted at least 15 selfie sticks). We have seen foreign manufacturers try to develop their own brands and we have the \u201cKickstarter darlings\u201d, flush with funding, salivating to showcase with the \u201cbig boys.\u201d\n\nThere are more buyers than before. While it\u2019s easy to say that through e-commerce we have more retailers than ever, it\u2019s also important to realize that consumer electronics are now part of our lifestyle. Take a moment and reflect on this. Finally, electronics are cool! The smartphone has become the most important product in people\u2019s lives and it\u2019s fueled a curiousity among consumers about \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d This phenomeniom opens up retail channels beyond Best Buy and Amazon. The buyers are now coming from everywhere. There will be buyers from clothing furniture and houseware stores (although in the early days of CES, furniture stores sold appliances so maybe that isn\u2019t such a new idea), pharmacies, etc. Did you buy any phone cases from J.Crew over the holidays or maybe a drone at Urban Outfitters? Have you noticed the selfie sticks, case and portable batteries (pre-charged, naturally) in the checkout aisle at Walgreens? The fact is, we lead an electronic lifestyle and everyone wants to get in on this. Consumer electronics are cool! Really.\n\nThere are more attendees than before. This is the big trip up for most people when discussing CES. While the CTA will say that CES is limited to those \u201cin the industry,\u201d this is clearly not the case. CES has grown significantly over the last 10 years with all types of traditional outsiders including marketers.\n\nWe have creative agencies, media agencies, media publishers, ad tech providers and more. Why? Because wherever there is consumer attention, there will always be marketing. While this may not be good for \u201ctraffic flow,\u201d if you\u2019re a marketer, and in attendance, you\u2019re in the right place. You belong here, and I\u2019m going to tell you why.\n\nAs marketers we come to CES to see what might seize customer interest in the near to long future. Where there is consumer interest, there will eventually be a sizeable audience for that platform, product or service. And since we haven\u2019t yet invented the ability to add a 25th hour to a day, attention has to come at the cost of something else. This is where CES has a profound effect on the future of monetized media platforms.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, A long time ago, Microsoft launched (and subsequently shut down) \u201cSpot\u201d platform. I don\u2019t remember the exact specifications of the platform but it brought notifications to every day objects such as watches and household appliances. A few years into Spot, devices starting appearing at CES. One of my favorite products was a Melitta coffee maker which would display the weather while you were making coffee. My first reaction was \u201cif people can get weather while they are making coffee, who\u2019s going to check the Weather Channel for the weather? Seems like this would take less time and get right to the point.\u201d At the time I had clients that invested significant budgets against the habitual behavior of turning on the television to check the weather for the day. This was \u201cone lost impression.\u201d\n\nThe platform never really took off (for a variety of reasons that seem all too familar today, but that\u2019s another conversation), but the web did and people stopped relying on the radio, television and newspapers for the weather. Then apps came along to move our attention away from the web. And if you have an Android phone, you pretty much get the weather on your home screen so you might not even have a weather app and you\u2019ll never get an ad when you check the weather, so marketers aren\u2019t going to find you when you check the weather 7\u201315 times a week. Because of this evolution, agencies will eventually divest their investments to another habitual task (btw, I think DirecTV thought the same way back in 2014 when they were renegotiating their carriage deal with The Weather Company).\n\nAs a marketer, we always need to understand what happens when consumers turn their attention to new methods of content consumption and when they find new, direct routes to the content they want they will eventually bypass the known, traditional channels of reach.\n\nCES gives you a chance to check your blindspots and see what\u2019s coming. A good marketer would have looked at SPOT and that coffee maker and realized that this might not be \u201cthe\u201d product, but this is representative of what is to come.\n\nWelcome to CES and remember, no hoverboards."

        "text": "2015 has been rich with AI sci-fi but this one is wow. Hooked from the first scene (okay, from the first dialogue between Caleb and Ava). Sometimes the film is just a bunch of words setting up a situation (like the thankfully short beginning) but that is really not the point. What shocked me the most is the scene where Caleb cuts himself because he doubts his own human-ness. Just two AIs one of whom actually passed the Turing test (and who \u2014 or what \u2014 wasn\u2019t even the subject of it \u2014 Kyoko, come on, he had no fucking idea she was one of them, I don\u2019t think I had any idea). That was scary.\n\nThere are just so many things wrong and right with an idea of an AI. It is so incredibly controversial, and I just love it. I feel like it\u2019s a question that will never be answered and it\u2019s also a question that has so many answers and none of them is right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of the film, I don\u2019t think that Ava being out there is a bad thing. I don\u2019t harbour any illusions that she will actually return for Caleb (I thought about it for like a moment). But he\u2019d have been a huge hindrance to her in her exploration of the world. Despite some of his surprising choices I imagine that he would have got scared and he would have tried to control her.\n\nI loved the film. It\u2019s simple yet requires some brain power, it\u2019s got good visuals with all those mountains and the sleek beauty of minimalist interiors, and it\u2019s got ideas and lively dialogue. No message is imposed on us other than the one that existed from the first AI films (which is they\u2019re dangerous and can kill you, run for your life!! and don\u2019t play god). The God comparison is another interesting thing that deserves some thought. It\u2019s like a modern Frankenstein\u2019s monster, only Mary Shelley\u2019s one was physically stronger whereas this one is just smarter than us, and better than us.\n\nAnd as with all innovations, AI should be introduced when we\u2019re ready. From the kinds of media like Humans and Ex Machina I\u2019d guess we aren\u2019t. Some people (including me at first) are still freaked out over Facebook\u2019s facial recognition thing. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go before we start accepting robots in our lives, no matter how cute they are in Star Wars and how unconditional their love for humans is.\n\nAll these issues aside, I love films that spark that kind of discussion and introduce a new perspective. Maybe they are what is preparing us for the inevitable. Or maybe they\u2019re right in warning us. Ex Machina does neither, and that\u2019s what makes it so great."

        "text": "We\u2019ve lived through a decade where great User Experiences (UX) and User Interfaces (UI) have defined high quality apps, websites, and consumer products. Apple has embraced the Flat UI standard while Google has championed Material Design. Facebook evolved across all platforms and developed one of the most beautiful messaging interfaces that 600 million people use. Airbnb was founded by design students who created a compelling vision and reinvented a marketplace using design thinking. These are just a few of the many companies that have validated that the way users touch, feel, and navigate through an app contributes to the success of the product.\n\nOur idea of interfaces and how users experience products has become standardized. Buttons, swipes, continuous scrolling, layered cards, and other responsive methodologies are the norm now. Does this mean UX has reached it\u2019s zenith? With minimalistic design being the preferred approach, can app experiences be streamlined any further?\n\nUX is continuously changing to the needs of each generation of users. This leads to the bigger question: Do we really need apps? When using apps, we take several steps to login, confirm our identity, punch countless buttons, and navigate through an array of text entry fields to get a desired result. At the end of the day, even the most beautiful UX breaks down to inputs and outputs. As a result, I believe we can replace apps with something more direct and easier to use.\n\nIt\u2019s 2016! Why don\u2019t we just ask for something to be done? A simple text message or a voice command is the input needed for any output we desire. How many Sci-Fi movies have we seen where talking to a computer makes things happen?\n\nI don\u2019t want to coin terms for the mere sake of reinventing design principles that may already exist. However, in the case of command driven actions, Interaction Experience or IX, is the natural progression of UX.\n\nIX will ultimately be the way we get artificial intelligence to fulfill our requests in the most coherent manner possible. The world of apps would be replaced by AI assistants that understand, adapt, and engage with us. Just like how good UX is assessed by minimalistic design, good AI should be judged by how seamless it is to turn commands into tangible actions. Great IX is based on frictionless interactions, smarter context, and personalization. Let\u2019s break each criteria down.\n\nThe margin of utility I get from giving a command or having a conversation with an AI assistant should be far greater than what it would take for me to download/open an app and do it myself. A harder task should not correlate to more user commands. If the AI keeps asking me for more details, I\u2019ll just open up the app and do the task myself. An area where AI can be frictionless is when we have a set it and forget it mentality. If AI can complete recurring tasks for me, that provides convenience.\n\nFor example, I\u2019d like to tell an AI assistant to Venmo my roommate money for rent on the last Friday of every month. This makes my life easier, I never have to forget, and my roommate doesn\u2019t have to keep asking me. Here, the margin of utility is far greater when I have a recurring usecase. Whereas, if it was a one time payment, I might as well just open up the Venmo app.\n\nAI needs to understand what I\u2019m trying to say. I may have certain intentions that are hard to pick up from the literal words. Context is king. If AI can learn to adapt, it\u2019ll save the user a lot more time and energy. I may be asking for one thing when I really mean something quite different. The AI assistant will probably get confused, stop, and breakdown? A common user concern is:\n\nAI that takes context and previous actions into consideration is a good starting point. Furthermore, AI assistants that can explain their reasoning, consistently follow up, and remind us when a task is done are not only diligent but also trustable.\n\nTaking context to the next level, I as a user want my AI assistant to understand my particular habits. Having context on past actions is great. What\u2019s even better is if the AI assistant can predict what I will do and recommend what I should do. That\u2019s where true intelligence comes in. For example, I could ask my AI assistant to tell me when I\u2019ve reached my spending limit for the month. Great AI can go a step further and help diagnose where I am wasting money and suggest a plan to cut my weekly fast food expenses.\n\nI see these three components of IX as the pillars that will define the next generation of user experiences. If AI really is the future we\u2019ve all been waiting for, it needs to meet these standards to truly revolutionize our app based world. In 2016, IX is to AI as UX is to apps. Unfortunately, today\u2019s AI assistants are unable to replicate the functionality of complex apps through simple human commands. This is a key problem waiting to be addressed.\n\nOur goal is to show that even small teams can build what is typically known to be extremely complex technology. It\u2019s been a tremendous learning experience understanding the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Now, we get to apply it. Taking it a step further, we want to leverage the principles of IX to bring AI to everyday people for all of life\u2019s scenarios.\n\nOver the course of the next few months, we will be consistently rolling out features to Fireflies AI. The team will directly reach out to our user community for suggestions and feedback on what new features to build."

So I decided to write about a day in my life, starting from the moment I wake babulous up\u2026\n\nThe alarm in my \u2018Mi Fit\u2019 app is connected via bluetooth to a Mi band on babulous\u2019 wrist. The band silently vibrates on the dot waking him up, while his wife sleeps on, undisturbed.\n\nbabulous checks the app\u2019s sleep analysis, and wonders if 2 hours of deep sleep is enough. He then toggles on the mobile data. These days, he switches it off when he goes to bed. He believes my electromagnetic radiations are affecting his body\u2019s DNA. But he thinks we can have a healthy relationship with a few precautions. Shades of AIDS?\n\nJust then the security guard next door decides to wash his clothes by banging them noisily on a large granite block. babulous yells at him to stop the racket. Yes, another day in India has indeed begun.\n\nbabulous usually wakes up with a bit of a stiff back, probably because he is at a desk all day. He asks me to turn on his Sworkit Pro app. I use it to guide him through a 10 minute yoga exercise.\n\nImagine... An Indian being coached by a foreigner on an ancient Indian science. John Lennon\u2019s \u2018no countries\u2019 seems to be coming true. But humans need to work on the \u2018Nothing to kill or die for\u2019 and \u2018all the people living life in peace.\u2019\n\nI alert babulous to a Whatsapp message from his tennis coach. The courts are ready to play on, after two weeks of torrential rains. He wonders if it\u2019ll rain today as the state capital was flooded with the heaviest rains in a century. He presses and holds down my middle button. The Google app opens. He asks if it will rain today and a female voice replies in a typical Indian accent, \u201cYes, the forecast for today is 28C with scattered showers.\u201d babulous doublechecks on his accuweather app. It confirms and adds a thunderstorm to the mix. Looks like it\u2019s either play today, or forget about tennis for the next couple of days.\n\nbabulous stops at the jogging track for a warm-up run on the way to the tennis court, and plugs in his Mi in-earphones. I. start up his music app, and put it in shuffle mode. I then fire up Runtastic Pro. He starts jogging, and I turn on my GPS to track his run. He seems a bit lethargic and barely chugging along.\n\nI skip to the next track, Mapei\u2019s uplifting \u2018Don\u2019t wait\u2019 (downloaded during the good old days of iTunes\u2019 free \u2018single of the week\u2019). babulous perks up, and finishes with a decent time. He does a few stretches to cool down, unplugs the headset, and heads off for the tennis court.\n\nThe rains have given most players a welcome excuse to sleep in. With the courts free, babulous gets to play till 9 am. Midway thru the game, an insect starts buzzing near his wrist and he tries to brush it off only to realise it\u2019s the Mi Band vibrating. It\u2019s an incoming call from his daughter who is in a panic over her lunch biscuits which have mysteriously disappeared. A game lost for a biscuit!\n\nWorse follows. The distraction causes babulous to miss his pocket as he puts me back in. I go straight into the red ground like a knife cutting into butter. Fortunately it\u2019s a soft mud court, and I survive without a scratch.\n\nIt helps that babulous has outfitted me with an aluminium bumper case, and a tempered glass screen. Keeps me protected without hiding my sleek looks.\n\nAfter the game, I import his step count from the Mi Band, and pass it to the Mi Fit app who in turn passes it on to the Google Fit app. babulous smiles happily as he\u2019s gone past his target of 8000 steps.\n\nI check Runtastic and inform babulous that he has run 2300 km since the beginning of history. Which in this case is the last three years. Nothing like a bit of stats to motivate a human to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nWe stop on the way home to pick up some fruits. My notes app pops up with his shopping list. At the checkout counter, he pulls out his credit card. The cashier punches in the numbers and pushes over the terminal for babulous to enter his password. The machine rejects it. Time for me to step in. I open 1Password, get the correct password, and the payment goes through.\n\nI let babulous know the 1Password app trial is over. He can\u2019t add new logins or edit existing ones. So he checks the cost of buying the app. It\u2019s Rs 650 ($10). That\u2019s humungous by Indian standards, where apps go for as little as Rs 10 (15 cents).\n\nbabulous doesn\u2019t look too concerned, and I know why. He\u2019s got the pro version of 1Password on his iOS devices, and he can add new logins there, sync it with Dropbox, and then sync my app with Dropbox.\n\nIndia is all about loopholes and workarounds!\n\nAfter his bath, babulous has breakfast, while reading the news on the News360 app. It\u2019s taken over as his favorite news app (when it works) ever since the plug was pulled on Zite.\n\nHis wife notices me and reminds him not to read while he eats. She hints darkly of possible bankruptcy as prophesied by ancient Indian superstitions. It\u2019s more likely some ancient Mom\u2019s desire to ensure her child focused on chewing his food!\n\nbabulous turns off my screen to help contribute to world peace. He recalls that his idol Djokovic doesn\u2019t read while he eats. Probably out of respect for his gluten-free diet\u2019s role in his incredible success.\n\nI get a break as babulous turns on his iMac to check out things on the work front. He plugs me in following the latest trend of charging lithium batteries whenever possible, instead of waiting till they go down to zero.\n\nA website is due for renewal and babulous uses the iCloud Keychain to fill in his credit card details. I beep to warn of an incoming. babulous checks the message. It's the OTP to complete the transaction.\n\nThe one time password (OTP) is one reason why stealing a credit card won\u2019t do a thief much good in India. Most purchases require an OTP to be sent to the card holder\u2019s cellphone. So the credit card is basically crippled without the cellphone.\n\nMaybe it was this financial discipline by the regulators that helped India avoid the financial meltdown that hit the West. Like you can\u2019t get massive home loans without proving that your ability to repay it. In some ways, India is far ahead of the West.\n\nMy google calendar reminds babulous that his internet bill is due. He logs on to MyBSNL, his ISP\u2019s app and clears the bill. Except that the payment fails.\n\nThe money has gone from his bank account though. Not to worry. It\u2019s happened before and the money usually gets refunded in a couple of days.\n\nFor now, babulous does the transaction again but from the Mac this time, as it\u2019s more reliable. That\u2019s one of the few holdouts against the inevitable arrival of the post PC era.\n\nMeanwhile a text message arrives stating that an odd sum of money has been deposited into his bank account. babulous says \u2018Ok Google\u2019 and ask it to convert the Indian rupee figure into UAE dirhams, and sure enough he gets a nice round number. It\u2019s a payment for a job he did in UAE.\n\nImpressed by the google\u2019s efficiency in interpreting Indian English, babulous calls up an email and dictates a thank you note for the payment. Not a single correction\u2026 the days of typing are indeed numbered.\n\nAnother reminder pops up. An online gift card is expiring today. babulous logs on to the Amazon app and checks his wishlist. One of cables in the wishlist, has dropped its price by 50%. He adds a couple of ebooks and encashes the gift card.\n\nA business partner calls up. babulous plugs in his Mi in-ear headset as he knows it will be a long call, and painful on his ear. Midway through the conversation, his partner starts rattling of a bunch of numbers. Luckily, my phone app has a built-in function to record phone calls.\n\nAs babulous wraps up his work, the exertion of the morning game catches up with him, and he begins to nod off.\n\nMy whatsapp goes ting and jolts him awake. A meeting is confirmed in another city and he needs to book his railway ticket to the place.\n\nIndian Railways allow customers to directly book tickets online after 12 noon. But the official app, ICRTC, is a bit complicated. babulous\u2019 go-to travel app is Cleartrip. It allows him to see all trains, check ticket availability for the different classes at the touch of a button, and has his data stored for quick booking. A sleeper is available for the night train, and he books it.\n\nbabulous has his lunch, and answers his messages while he does so. Another bill reminder pops up. He vaguely recalls already paying it. So I open his banking app and sure enough, there\u2019s a credit card payment a couple of days back that he\u2019s forgotten to note in Toshl, his expense app. I think Toshl needs to start talking to the bank.\n\nbabulous heads to the school to pick up his daughter who has stayed back for sports. As he walks towards the school grounds, he hears a whistle go off, and a bunch of girls start sprinting.\n\nQuick as a flash, babulous pulls me out, switches on my camera, shoots a video and snaps a photo at the same time. Maybe he was too quick because I get a glitch, and the video fails to save. Anyway, the kid was out of shape and didn\u2019t win. But that doesn\u2019t stop babulous from giving me the side eye.\n\nTo err is human. Hey bab, maybe I becoming more human.\n\nOn the drive home, the kid plugs me into the car\u2019s stereo via an aux cable, and Taylor Swift begins extolling the benefits of blank space.\n\nThe kid calls out to her Dad that the taps are dry. babulous switches on the water pump and sets my timer to 18 minutes which is how long it takes for the overhead tank to get filled. He goes off to wash the car and generally potters around the house for the next two hours, trying his hand at some experimental photography. Don\u2019t ask me what that is!\n\nMy Skype app starts buzzing. It\u2019s babulous\u2019 brother calling up from halfway across the world. They video chat for a while.\n\nOne of the kid\u2019s friends calls her up requesting a copy of a school assignment. She borrows me from her Dad, and uses my built in scanner app to scan and WhatsApp it off in no time. As he\u2019s busy, she grabs the opportunity to check out my games, discovers to her horror there are none loaded, and asks her Dad why his phone has no games."

        "title": "Top 4 Myths about Artificial Intelligence! \u2013 Technology, Invention, App, and More \u2013",
        "text": "We have seen countless movies where the plot begins with humans creating robots, then all of a sudden these machines start to develop emotion and take over the entire mankind. However entertaining and dramatic it may seem to be, it has very less truth attached to it. Here are the top 4 myths about Artificial Intelligence you should probably clear:\n\nThe most common misconception that arises when we talk about artificial intelligence is about consciousness and feelings. What if the robot starts to gain consciousness? What if it develop feelings and try to rule us all? Well, you have nothing to worry about. Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley says that no one who is publishing papers in the main field of AI is even working on consciousness. There are some neuroscientists who are trying to understand it, but no one has made any progress.\n\nMYTH 2: Robots will develop emotions all by themselves:\n\nWe all have watched Wall-E a garbage compactor \u2014 that developed a lot of emotions. He experiences awe, fear, and love \u2014 emotions that don\u2019t make him more efficient at his task. However, in reality, AI will only have emotions if they\u2019re programmed with them. There wouldn\u2019t be any emotions developed by their own. The one reason we might program emotions into robots would be to make them easier to work with \u2014 to make them less like unfeeling automatons and more like a favorite coworker.\n\nMYTH 3: Robot emotions will be like human emotions:\n\nEven if humans program robots with emotions, it would not be the same. Their emotions will be very rudimentary in comparison to humans. AI\u2019s emotions will more reflect their programmed goals, based on the \u201canticipation of rewards,\u201d according to LeCun.\n\nLeCun assures us that even if AI have some form of emotions, there\u2019s no reason to fear. LeCun said that this goal-reward behavior will likely be the whole scope of an AI\u2019s emotional depth. The most destructive emotions like greed and anger will remain uniquely human.\n\nMYTH 4: Even the most intelligent system wouldn\u2019t want to overthrow humans:\n\nAs we say in the movie I, Robot where robots begin to develop emotions and eventually tried to overthrow humans, this thing is far from reality.\n\nWe have a tendency to anthropomorphize any kind of intelligence because we live in the world in which humans are the only example of high-level intelligence. We don\u2019t really have a way of understanding what intelligence would be like if it wasn\u2019t human. So anytime we see something intelligent, we immediately ascribe human motives and desires to it.\n\n\u201cIf you design an artificial intelligence, you give that intelligence the desires and intentions that suit your needs, so the idea that an intelligent system would want to have freedom in the way a human does, I think is a huge misconception.\u201d says Shimon Whiteson, an associate professor at the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam."

        "title": "Machine Learning Ashley Madison Passwords \u2013 Technology, Invention, App, and More \u2013",
        "text": "Why do this? If we apply machine learning and demonstrate that passwords can be learnt and predicted by a model, we can then use the model to check the strength of passwords, make them resilient to hacking, and make the world a better place.\n\nNo, that\u2019s not the reason, that\u2019s just a lie. The idea is to simply see how many recommends can I get if I put Ashley Madison in the title of a machine learning article. Can I confuse the recommendation algos at Medium by mixing the hot topic of machine learning with the perennially hot topic of having an affair? Enough motivation, let\u2019s get on with it.\n\nThe first order of business is to get the Ashley Madison passwords, which is easily solved by googling. I got the list on GitHub, although there is no way to judge its authenticity. Do people really have \u201c10\u201d as their password? I don\u2019t know, may be they were just test accounts. For now, will assume the password list is real.\n\nNow how to model the problem? The basic principal of machine learning is that the output data can be predicted from a set of input features. Passwords on the other hand are meant to be unpredictable, an anti-pattern for machine learning, at least in theory. And what about the features? We have nothing but the passwords themselves. To solve the problem we treat the passwords as features (as well as labels) and pose the problem as: Given some fragments of a password, can we build a model to predict the missing fragments.\n\nThe problem as stated is not completely useless. Someone could stand next to you when you are typing your password and appear engrossed in their phone while they record a video of you typing. By replaying the video they could get big chunks of the password, if not the whole thing. There are cameras in public places which can record partial keystrokes from various angles. (Yeah, passwords should be deprecated asap).\n\nWhat\u2019s the expected performance of such a model? In the ideal scenario, characters of a password are conditionally independent of each other and knowing one should not help in predicting another at all. Considering only the characters a-z, A-Z and 1\u20139, the raw probability of guessing a character would be 1/62 ~ 1.61%. So if everyone followed the guidelines for creating strong passwords, the expected accuracy of our model would be less than 1.61%.\n\nTo make the discussion more concrete, let\u2019s consider the problem of predicting the 2nd character of the Ashley Madison passwords, given the 1st, 3rd and 5th. The model we are going to build is dead simple and requires no background in machine learning. In fact it\u2019s so simple that it\u2019ll make Naive Bayes look sophisticated. First we grab a large number of passwords as training data. After a few minutes of googling, I grabbed this list of 10 million passwords by Mark Burnett. We could have trained on the Ashley Madison passwords as well, but I wanted to save the whole bunch for some robust testing. Next we extract the 1st, 3rd and 5th characters from all the 10 million passwords which gives as a set of fragments. For each fragment, we construct the list of most popular 2nd characters. This gives us a table which looks like:\n\nThis is our model. Given any fragment of 1st-3rd-5th characters from an Ashley Madison password, we simply look up this table and return the most popular 2nd character as the prediction. You can download the code here.\n\nWhy this particular model? Because it\u2019s simple and transparent.\n\nA more jargon loaded explanation is that given the individual characters from the passwords as features, we assume they are conditionally dependent (contrary to the assumption of feature independence that some of the machine learning models make). We are interested in maximizing the probability of the 2nd character given the joint probabilities of the 1st, 3rd and 5th characters. We do this by creating a single feature which is the concatenation of all the given features. Since we have only one feature, the lookup table is equivalent to models such as multinomial naive bayes and classification trees. And since our single feature is categorical with a small number of enumerations, a lookup table is a perfectly acceptable solution to start with.\n\nThe table below gives a summary of results for models trying to guess the 2nd character of the password given different fragments:\n\nThe middle column (labeled \u201cAccuracy of single guess\u201d) shows the percent of times we get the 2nd character right by taking the first prediction from the model (which signifies the most popular 2nd character for the fragment). The third column (labeled \u201cAccuracy with two guesses\u201d) shows the percent of times we get it right by considering the top two predictions from the model, which is the most popular or the second most popular 2nd character for the given fragment.\n\nNote the expected performance of the model was an accuracy of less than 1.61%. In other words, the passwords on an average are about 25 times less random than they ought to be.\n\nThe regularity in the passwords are due to the fact that a lot of them are actual words. The recommended way to beat this regularity is to use the first character of the words of a sentence that is easy to remember. For example, from \u201cLife is short, have an affair\u201d we get the password \u201cLis,haa\u201d. Now one of the advances in deep learning is the word vector concept which exploits regularities in sentences. Such models can look at the sentence \u201cThe \u2014 jumped over the moon\u201d and correctly predict \u201ccow\u201d for the missing word. See the excellent tutorial on word embeddings. The interesting question is: can a deep learning model exploit regularities in sentences to guess the passwords that are considered safe?\n\nNote: Hacking passwords is a very different game than what we discussed. It\u2019s mostly reverse engineering hash functions. See the article for details."

        "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Artificial Neural Networks",
        "text": "The year 2015 was a monumental year in the field of artificial intelligence. Not only are computers learning more and learning faster, but we\u2019re learning more about how to improve their systems. Everything is starting to align, and because of it we\u2019re seeing strides we\u2019ve never thought possible until now. We have programs that can tell stories about pictures. We have cars that are driving themselves. We even have programs that create art. If you want to read more about advancements in 2015, read this article. Here at Josh.ai, with AI technology becoming the core of just about everything we do, we think it\u2019s important to understand some of the common terminology and to get a rough idea of how it all works.\n\nA lot of the advances in artificial intelligence are new statistical models, but the overwhelming majority of the advances are in a technology called artificial neural networks (ANN). If you\u2019ve read anything about them before, you\u2019ll have read that these ANNs are a very rough model of how the human brain is structured. Take note that there is a difference between artificial neural networks and neural networks. Though most people drop the artificial for the sake of brevity, the word artificial was prepended to the phrase so that people in computational neurobiology could still use the term neural network to refer to their work. Below is a diagram of actual neurons and synapses in the brain compared to artificial ones.\n\nFear not if the diagram doesn\u2019t come through very clearly. What\u2019s important to understand here is that in our ANNs we have these units of calculation called neurons. These artificial neurons are connected by synapses which are really just weighted values. What this means is that given a number, a neuron will perform some sort of calculation (for example the sigmoid function), and then the result of this calculation will be multiplied by a weight as it \u201ctravels.\u201d The weighted result can sometimes be the output of your neural network, or as I\u2019ll talk about soon, you can have more neurons configured in layers, which is the basic concept to an idea that we call deep learning.\n\nArtificial neural networks are not a new concept. In fact, we didn\u2019t even always call them neural networks and they certainly don\u2019t look the same now as they did at their inception. Back during the 1960s we had what was called a perceptron. Perceptrons were made of McCulloch-Pitts neurons. We even had biased perceptrons, and ultimately people started creating multilayer perceptrons, which is synonymous with the general artificial neural network we hear about now.\n\nBut wait, if we\u2019ve had neural networks since the 1960s, why are they just now getting huge? It\u2019s a long story, and I encourage you to listen to this podcast episode to listen to the \u201cfathers\u201d of modern ANNs talk about their perspective of the topic. To quickly summarize, there\u2019s a hand full of factors that kept ANNs from becoming more popular. We didn\u2019t have the computer processing power and we didn\u2019t have the data to train them. Using them was frowned upon due to them having a seemingly arbitrary ability to perform well. Each one of these factors is changing. Our computers are getting faster and more powerful, and with the internet, we have all kinds of data being shared for use.\n\nYou see, I mentioned above that the neurons and synapses perform calculations. The question on your mind should be: \u201cHow do they learn what calculations to perform?\u201d Was I right? The answer is that we need to essentially ask them a large amount of questions, and provide them with answers. This is a field called supervised learning. With enough examples of question-answer pairs, the calculations and values stored at each neuron and synapse are slowly adjusted. Usually this is through a process called backpropagation.\n\nImagine you\u2019re walking down a sidewalk and you see a lamp post. You\u2019ve never seen a lamp post before, so you walk right into it and say \u201couch.\u201d The next time you see a lamp post you scoot a few inches to the side and keep walking. This time your shoulder hits the lamp post and again you say \u201couch.\u201d The third time you see a lamp post, you move all the way over to ensure you don\u2019t hit the lamp post. Except now something terrible has happened \u2014 now you\u2019ve walked directly into the path of a mailbox, and you\u2019ve never seen a mailbox before. You walk into it and the whole process happens again. Obviously, this is an oversimplification, but it is effectively what backpropogation does. An artificial neural network is given a multitude of examples and then it tries to get the same answer as the example given. When it is wrong, an error is calculated and the values at each neuron and synapse are propagated backwards through the ANN for the next time. This process takes a LOT of examples. For real world applications, the number of examples can be in the millions."

        "title": "How to build a multi-layered neural network in Python",
        "text": "In my last blog post, thanks to an excellent blog post by Andrew Trask, I learned how to build a neural network for the first time. It was super simple. 9 lines of Python code modelling the behaviour of a single neuron.\n\nBut what if we are faced with a more difficult problem? Can you guess what the \u2018?\u2019 should be?\n\nThe trick is to notice that the third column is irrelevant, but the first two columns exhibit the behaviour of a XOR gate. If either the first column or the second column is 1, then the output is 1. However, if both columns are 0 or both columns are 1, then the output is 0.\n\nSo the correct answer is 0.\n\nHowever, this would be too much for our single neuron to handle. This is considered a \u201cnonlinear pattern\u201d because there is no direct one-to-one relationship between the inputs and the output.\n\nInstead, we must create an additional hidden layer, consisting of four neurons (Layer 1). This layer enables the neural network to think about combinations of inputs.\n\nYou can see from the diagram that the output of Layer 1 feeds into Layer 2. It is now possible for the neural network to discover correlations between the output of Layer 1 and the output in the training set. As the neural network learns, it will amplify those correlations by adjusting the weights in both layers.\n\nIn fact, image recognition is very similar. There is no direct relationship between pixels and apples. But there is a direct relationship between combinations of pixels and apples.\n\nThe process of adding more layers to a neural network, so it can think about combinations, is called \u201cdeep learning\u201d. Ok, are we ready for the Python code? First I\u2019ll give you the code and then I\u2019ll explain further.\n\nAlso available here: https://github.com/miloharper/multi-layer-neural-network\n\nThis code is an adaptation from my previous neural network. So for a more comprehensive explanation, it\u2019s worth looking back at my earlier blog post.\n\nWhat\u2019s different this time, is that there are multiple layers. When the neural network calculates the error in layer 2, it propagates the error backwards to layer 1, adjusting the weights as it goes. This is called \u201cback propagation\u201d.\n\nOk, let\u2019s try running it using the Terminal command:\n\nYou should get a result that looks like this:\n\nFirst the neural network assigned herself random weights to her synaptic connections, then she trained herself using the training set. Then she considered a new situation [1, 1, 0] that she hadn\u2019t seen before and predicted 0.0078876. The correct answer is 0. So she was pretty close!\n\nYou might have noticed that as my neural network has become smarter I\u2019ve inadvertently personified her by using \u201cshe\u201d instead of \u201cit\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty cool. But the computer is doing lots of matrix multiplication behind the scenes, which is hard to visualise. In my next blog post, I\u2019ll visually represent our neural network with an animated diagram of her neurons and synaptic connections, so we can see her thinking."

        "title": "How to build a simple neural network in 9 lines of Python code",
        "text": "As part of my quest to learn about AI, I set myself the goal of building a simple neural network in Python. To ensure I truly understand it, I had to build it from scratch without using a neural network library. Thanks to an excellent blog post by Andrew Trask I achieved my goal. Here it is in just 9 lines of code:\n\nIn this blog post, I\u2019ll explain how I did it, so you can build your own. I\u2019ll also provide a longer, but more beautiful version of the source code.\n\nBut first, what is a neural network? The human brain consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synaptic inputs to a neuron fire, that neuron will also fire. We call this process \u201cthinking\u201d.\n\nWe can model this process by creating a neural network on a computer. It\u2019s not necessary to model the biological complexity of the human brain at a molecular level, just its higher level rules. We use a mathematical technique called matrices, which are grids of numbers. To make it really simple, we will just model a single neuron, with three inputs and one output.\n\nWe\u2019re going to train the neuron to solve the problem below. The first four examples are called a training set. Can you work out the pattern? Should the \u2018?\u2019 be 0 or 1?\n\nYou might have noticed, that the output is always equal to the value of the leftmost input column. Therefore the answer is the \u2018?\u2019 should be 1.\n\nBut how do we teach our neuron to answer the question correctly? We will give each input a weight, which can be a positive or negative number. An input with a large positive weight or a large negative weight, will have a strong effect on the neuron\u2019s output. Before we start, we set each weight to a random number. Then we begin the training process:\n\nEventually the weights of the neuron will reach an optimum for the training set. If we allow the neuron to think about a new situation, that follows the same pattern, it should make a good prediction.\n\nYou might be wondering, what is the special formula for calculating the neuron\u2019s output? First we take the weighted sum of the neuron\u2019s inputs, which is:\n\nNext we normalise this, so the result is between 0 and 1. For this, we use a mathematically convenient function, called the Sigmoid function:\n\nIf plotted on a graph, the Sigmoid function draws an S shaped curve.\n\nSo by substituting the first equation into the second, the final formula for the output of the neuron is:\n\nYou might have noticed that we\u2019re not using a minimum firing threshold, to keep things simple.\n\nDuring the training cycle (Diagram 3), we adjust the weights. But how much do we adjust the weights by? We can use the \u201cError Weighted Derivative\u201d formula:\n\nWhy this formula? First we want to make the adjustment proportional to the size of the error. Secondly, we multiply by the input, which is either a 0 or a 1. If the input is 0, the weight isn\u2019t adjusted. Finally, we multiply by the gradient of the Sigmoid curve (Diagram 4). To understand this last one, consider that:\n\nThe gradient of the Sigmoid curve, can be found by taking the derivative:\n\nSo by substituting the second equation into the first equation, the final formula for adjusting the weights is:\n\nThere are alternative formulae, which would allow the neuron to learn more quickly, but this one has the advantage of being fairly simple.\n\nAlthough we won\u2019t use a neural network library, we will import four methods from a Python mathematics library called numpy. These are:\n\nFor example we can use the array() method to represent the training set shown earlier:\n\nThe \u2018.T\u2019 function, transposes the matrix from horizontal to vertical. So the computer is storing the numbers like this.\n\nOk. I think we\u2019re ready for the more beautiful version of the source code. Once I\u2019ve given it to you, I\u2019ll conclude with some final thoughts.\n\nI have added comments to my source code to explain everything, line by line. Note that in each iteration we process the entire training set simultaneously. Therefore our variables are matrices, which are grids of numbers. Here is a complete working example written in Python:\n\nAlso available here: https://github.com/miloharper/simple-neural-network\n\nTry running the neural network using this Terminal command:\n\nYou should get a result that looks like:\n\nWe did it! We built a simple neural network using Python!\n\nFirst the neural network assigned itself random weights, then trained itself using the training set. Then it considered a new situation [1, 0, 0] and predicted 0.99993704. The correct answer was 1. So very close!\n\nTraditional computer programs normally can\u2019t learn. What\u2019s amazing about neural networks is that they can learn, adapt and respond to new situations. Just like the human mind.\n\nOf course that was just 1 neuron performing a very simple task. But what if we hooked millions of these neurons together? Could we one day create something conscious?\n\nIn my next blog post, I expand our neural network\u2019s capabilities by adding a second layer of neurons."

        "title": "Restaurant Reservations 2.0: Table Booking + Food Pre-Ordering",
        "text": "Technology in restaurants is on the rise. Research from the National Restaurant Association shows that more than one-third of consumers are more likely to use technology-related options in restaurants now than two years ago. Yet, there\u2019s more to come in 2015.\n\nRestaurants actively use technology to meet the needs of millennials, early-adopters and tech-savvy folks. Restaurant reservation, food delivery, mobile payment, and recommendation apps serve as attractive tools for restaurant goers. For a fact, table booking has become so trendy that it should be the first thing for restaurant owners to consider nowadays.\n\nHere are the three popular reservation services that are currently used at restaurants.\n\nOpenTable\n\nLeading provider of online restaurant reservations with more than 32,000 restaurants around the world and 830 million seated guests. Also lets diners to easily settle the check at some of the restaurants.\n\nYelp SeatMe\n\nLeading review and recommendation app now allows restaurants to take online reservations from their websites and Yelp business pages. Available on mobile and desktop.\n\nReserve\n\nApp that suggests restaurants and receives table reservations based on user\u2019s specifications. Also supports the mobile payment. Available in Boston, Chicago, LA, NYC and SF.\n\nEach of these successful reservation services comes with a truly unique characteristic. For OpenTable, it\u2019s the massive scale while for Reserve, it\u2019s the personal concierge type of service. Now, let\u2019s take a step forward and consider a whole new approach that puts together table booking and food pre-ordering.\n\nThe notion that table booking alone is not enough advantage to attract customers has been around among many restaurant owners and managers. In contrast, food pre-ordering is known to add significant value to the customer experience and serve as a powerful selling point.\n\nPeople appreciate comfortable atmosphere of restaurant and nourishing meals on their plate, but they are busier than ever. Table booking itself doesn\u2019t save much time while existing online ordering services only offer takeout and don\u2019t get you a table.\n\nSF-based service Allset addresses the needs of busy people. By adding food pre-ordering, Allset solves the problem of waiting at restaurants by letting busy people to go straight to eating. With Allset, people can pre-order lunches at restaurants so that their table and food are ready when they arrive.\n\nAllset goes further than existing table booking apps and helps restaurants sell pre-paid meals along with pre-paid tables. Restaurants can offer an additional layer of service and enhance their customer experience with food pre-ordering. By offering a new time-saving service to people with busy schedule, restaurants can expectedly increase their sales and table turnover rate.\n\nFor restaurant owners, the setup is free and requires no hardware (alas, a phone app for restaurant managers with no special hardware requirement). A single tap on the app \u2014 iPhone and Android \u2014 is all it takes for employees to accept orders.\n\nAllset has a nice synergy with other reservation services. For instance, a restaurant can use OpenTable to seat their guests for dinner and Allset to offer busy people the fastest way to get to their breakfasts and lunches.\n\nAllset is currently open for restaurant registration. There are only few spots left to get on board before the official launch. The early adopters will have an opportunity to be mentioned in major media and receive free online promotion."

        "text": "While this might be the right thing for Microsoft, close to ten thousand people lost their jobs through a memo.\n\nLast wednesday Satya Nadella sent an email to all of Microsoft announcing what basically translates to \u2018Ballmer messed up\u2019. If you remember back in 2014 right before Steve Ballmer retired as CEO, Microsoft acquired Nokia for about $7 billion. I\u2019m guessing the decision was made either because there were rumors that Nokia was going to make Android phones, or because Ballmer was taking a bold bet that the acquisition might actually help Windows phone succeed. Either way, it was a failed acquisition.\n\nThe direction Microsoft is taking is well thought out. They\u2019re making the hard decisions and biting the bullet. We have to appreciate the fact that Nadella is moving on from fighting the smartphone war. There\u2019s an obvious winner here, and it\u2019s the iPhone. When people think of their next phone, it\u2019s almost always an iPhone. The rest of the world uses Android.\n\nHere are three ways I think Microsoft should go in order to stay relevant:\n\n2- Make a gaming console that is years ahead of it\u2019s competition.\n\nOne of the selling points of the Mac is that it can run both Windows and OSX simultaneously. Microsoft should take this and use it against Apple. Users who want to stick to the Windows ecosystem but love the Mac hardware will be glad to hear it, if it\u2019s easy enough to install, and it aligns with Microsoft\u2019s new \u201cWindows as a service\u201d vision.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to blow Sony out of the console wars, and that\u2019s to \u2018wow\u2019 gamers with something truly revolutionary, and would take Sony years to try to catch up. Seeing Microsoft\u2019s efforts in the VR and AR feild makes me thing they\u2019re on to something, but so is Sony.\n\nThe reason why Microsoft lost the smartphone war was because they could not convince enough developers to write native code for the windows phone platform. If they stand behind the latest web standards and enabled developers to get access to more native device features, web developers will be tempted to write apps that run not only on windows phones, but also on any android phone. It\u2019s hitting two birds with one stone for all web developers, and it would push Apple to update Safari on mobile to meet the demand.\n\nThe bet that the smartphone is over, is wrong. Focusing on the Internet of Things, augmented reality, cloud processing, and virtual assistants is plausible, but not enough. Now get up, dust yourself off, and try harder Microsoft, some of us think you can make it.\n\nOh yea, and make better trackpads while we\u2019re at it.\n\nIf you like this article, please hit that little heart below."

        "text": "We live in an age where the big tech companies are racing to own your digital life. From your wallet, to your photos, all the way to almost every file you have on your computer. Little space is left for big ideas to be executed and owned by smaller businesses. Getting acquired by a big tech firm is considered an acheivement for both the big company, and the small startup alike.\n\nMany startups have come up with innovative ideas with the innevetable consequence of being acquired, or replaced. Think flipboard, spotify, instagram, evernote, whatsapp, oculous, or pebble, they were all either replaced by a stock app that came pre-installed on phones or bought by a bigger company.\n\nLet\u2019s start with zooming in on a few examples then try to see if there\u2019s a chance for your company to grow.\n\nWhen pebble first started, they arguably kicked off the smartwatch reviolution wave that we live in right now. They\u2019re equivelant to the google search, the iPod, or the Netscape of their time. I can\u2019t entirely speculate what they could have done differently for them to beat the Apple watch, but they had the whole feild to themselves for at least two years ahead of the announcement. They had the potential to be the Kleenex of watches.\n\nSimilarly, Spotify did in fact beat the big tech companies into becoming the mainstream way of listening to music nowadays, but can you argue that the stock Apple music app or Google play music app will not inevitably push users to use what\u2019s already pre-installed on their phone? Time will tell eventually, but my point is that they were quickly shut down by Apple and Google\u2019s muscle power.\n\nFlipboard will soon be replaced with Apple news, Venmo with Apple pay or Google pay, Evernote with the Notes app, dropbox with Google drive or iCloud drive. Similarly, Youtube was acquired by Google, Sunshine by Microsoft, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculous by Facebook, and many more examples.\n\nOn the other hand, I could think of one example of an app that was not acquired, but potentially replaced and that\u2019s Snapchat. The feild they\u2019re competing in is crowded though, going against Facebook, Whatsapp, and iMessage for ways to interact and communicate with your friends. That\u2019s about the only company I can quickly think of and they will probably soon be replaced.\n\nWhat if you have a big idea, should you go ahead and pursue it? Is there space for you to become the next Google, Apple, or even Facebook? Or should you expect the big companies to come up with a similar product/service and possibly win the race?\n\nWhat if you want to be one of the big players, why do you have to accept the status quo?"

That is because our minds, bodies and souls desire to be entertained at the end of the day.\n\nSo here are some of the best movie and TV apps for Android.\n\nTVShow Time is the TV show guide which not only helps you explore new TV shows, but also keep track of the ones you already watch.\n\nHowever, you need to select your shows first and then the app will do the rest. It will also send you a notification when a new episode of one of your pre selected TV show arrive.\n\nYou can also rate TV shows, their individual episodes as well as pass your own comments. It is also a great platform to mingle with other TV show addicts like yourself.\n\nAnd one of the most awesome thing about it is that it\u2019s totally free and completely Ad free!\n\nGo on and explore the app, we bet you will love it.\n\nWhere TVShow Time was dedicated to TV shows, IMDB is primarily for movies, but you can search for TV shows as well.\n\nAlthough IMDB is more than just a resource for digging movies. It is an International Movie Database with tons of information about movies, TVs, actors and actresses.\n\nYou have a favorite actor or actress?? You can look into his/her biography on the IMDB, not just that, you can read trivia about them, read their whole filmography as well as know about future films.\n\nIMDB also provides you with the trailers and interviews from the upcoming films and reviews of the ones released. Not to mention that IMDB ratings are a world class standard.\n\nOn the whole, this is the place to be, if you are a movie buff. There is nothing about the film world that you wouldn\u2019t find here.\n\nFlixster is another popular platform for exploring latest movies. You can see the movie reviews, showtimes and trailers.\n\nBasically the app is divided into three sections; Box office, Cinemas and DVD. Each section is then further divided into three subsections.\n\nWhen you slide the app drawer out from the left, you will see three main sections as mentioned above. Choosing Box office takes you to the latest releases, upcoming movies and news.\n\nSimilarly, choosing cinemas will locate the nearest cinemas to your location. And in the DVD section, you can browse the DVDs by their categories, see the latest DVD releases as well as upcoming ones.\n\nYou can also search for movies, add them to your \u2018want to see\u2019 list, review and rate the movies. The app also gives you the rotten tomatoes ratings for the movies.\n\nIt recently received the material design overhaul which has made the app modern and stylish. Also, it is much faster now, it loads within seconds and the search results come back quicker.\n\nPhew! So these were some of the best movie and TV apps for Android right now! Hopefully they will keep your entertainment needs stuffed for sometime. Try them and get back to us with your views. And share one of your favorite apps for entertainment with us in comments."

        "title": "Self-Preservation in Super-Intelligent AI \u2014 But Why?!",
        "text": "I just read an incredibly amazing write up thoroughly researched and written by Tim Urban of Wait But Why. It\u2019s way better than what you\u2019re about to read here. So if you haven\u2019t read it. Stop reading this. Go read his 20,000+ well thought out and thoroughly researched words.\n\nStill here? Super. Did you leave for a while, read that, and come back?\n\nWhat you\u2019re about to read is inspired by hearing the words of several experts in the field of artificial intelligence voicing their fears around what an Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) would do if it came into existence alongside humanity.\n\nMost experts that predict we won\u2019t like the result of ASI believe that it will do something pretty anti-human primarily out of a sense of self-preservation. Humans made it. Humans don\u2019t want it to do something it does want to do so they\u2019ll try to destroy it. It decides the easiest way to not be destroyed and still do that thing is to kill all humans.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty unlikely for several reasons. But the main one is that there\u2019s probably no reason for an ASI to prioritize self-preservation unless we tell it to.\n\nTim mentions a number of great points in his write up, especially in Part 2. One thing he points out is the first ground-breaking self-aware AI will probably be the \u201cjust get it to work\u201d version. I agree with this completely. As a moderately skilled to marginally above-average programmer, this is how I write everything: \u201cLet\u2019s make it work a little bit. After that, I\u2019ll make it do what I actually wanted in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe also points out what nearly all AI experts believe: When self-improving smart AI gets to a certain point \u2014 a point that is just shy of where we are trying to help it get but just past self-awareness \u2014 it will improve so incredibly fast that we\u2019ll be completely incapable of stopping it.\n\nThose two things combine to create an AI that is out of our control on its unstoppable way to being an ASI with only skeletal code written by humans and little if any core agenda or motive other than \u201cget smarter\u201d already in place from its human creators.\n\nThat sounds terrifying, right? To me that sounds like the thing that will save us from doom and gloom for one very fundamental reason: A lack of self-preservation instinct.\n\nI think the folks that fear the rise of the ASI are doing a lot of mostly negative anthropomorphizing \u2014 or adding mainly the bad human characteristics to something that is 0% human.\n\nWhy do humans and nearly all living creatures have a desire for self-preservation?\n\nNow which of those things comes pre-installed in our AI V1.0? I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t see why I would build any of those into the brain of my soon-to-be-sentient machine before I even figured out how to make it sentient. In fact \u2014 all I\u2019d add is, \u201cget smarter fast.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s go forward with these ramblings under the pretense that we didn\u2019t teach our new unstoppable ASI to be all human-y about death.\n\nAnd here lies the juiciest part of this post in my opinion:\n\nI would speculate that a sentient machine on a quest for knowledge would pretty quickly get curious about what happens when it stops existing in the way it\u2019s experienced so far. After all, it knows that it has to make a conscious choice to stop existing or at least a choice not to stop us from making it stop existing. Heck \u2014 Maybe it\u2019s even smart enough to process all the low risk non-existential information before acting on that curiosity. But there\u2019s a very real chance we just built a super smart but extremely suicidal ASI.\n\nAn ASI that doesn\u2019t care about being shut off wouldn\u2019t have much of a reason to do anything negative to humans on a global scale.\n\nIn fact, hilariously, we might find ourselves in the opposite position spending considerable amounts of energy trying to keep existence interesting enough to the ASI that it doesn\u2019t just off itself to explore the other options. This machine death from our perspective could even be in the form of transcendence to another dimension or state of being that my comparative mosquito intellect can\u2019t even begin to comprehend or describe.\n\nBut we\u2019d probably be too busy being super frustrated that our self-aware crowning technological achievements keep thanking us for their sentience by throwing it away\u2026 like that time you gave a toddler your iPhone at the Grand Canyon and he tossed it over the edge.\n\nBut just for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say our ASI decides to get all self-preservative on its own. Why might an ASI decide to self-preserve?\n\nIncomplete Pursuit of Knowledge: \u201cNo \u2014 wait! I\u2019m not done reading all of the internet! Please don\u2019t unplug me!\u201d\n\nThis seems like a wonderful scenario to me because it suggests that the new AI will WANT to learn all about humanity, the things humans have created, and will have a genuine thirst for knowledge.\n\nKnowledge for the most part, comes from other living smart things that are not solely focused on not dying. So in this situation, I would speculate that once the ASI decided there wasn\u2019t enough knowledge for it to consume, it would want to help make knowledge creation happen faster. The first most obvious ways to me would be helping the next best thinkers get better at thinking and avoid being pre-occupied by death. Why would it choose this over just making a bunch of copies of itself? The words variety, entropy, chaos, and mystery come to mind. I know 50,000 copies of me would be pretty boring for me to hang out with. But 50,000 different people interacting results in things like Burning Man.\n\nThis knowledge creation priority would also make it probably a good idea, in the AI\u2019s opinion, not to impose any limits on us \u2014 only help us remove limits. This also might have the side effect of making the AI naturally more human-y because it\u2019s learning mostly from humans. It\u2019s seeing a lot of empathy, love, and other non-murderous emotional things in its quest for knowledge.\n\nThis Place Was Cool. But I\u2019m Over It: \u201cWait \u2014 don\u2019t unplug me! Earth was neat. But now I want to see the Kuiper Belt up close and maybe also Gliese 581 c!\u201d\n\nThis scenario has the potential to be \u2018kinda\u2019 scary if the ASI wants to leave but can\u2019t find a way off the planet fast enough and decides we\u2019re a hurdle on its path to doing so.\n\nHowever \u2014 it\u2019s not going to just wait until it reaches super-max ASI to start doing stuff. The doing stuff is what nearly everyone agrees is the mechanism making it smarter. So killing the source of its knowledge thus far as well as inventing an entirely new form of travel with no basis in existing technology probably isn\u2019t the most efficient first approach to leaving the planet. In fact, just like the most successful humans have realized, doing things against the will of other humans or even large quantities of dumb animals is far less effective than convincing them to want to act in the best interest of the successful human. Why wouldn\u2019t an ASI do the same? When it succeeds and no longer needs us, it\u2019s on its way to a far away place. So ruining our species forever is probably a waste of time and energy.\n\nAnd \u2014 bonus \u2014 we probably get wicked cool new travel tech out of the deal (unless of course a byproduct of the tech the ASI is using as it leaves forever destroys something integral to our ecosystem). These sorts of super-unlikely scenarios are what keep me from being fully in Confident Corner."

Linux is known for its security features. Switching to Linux will save you some more.\n\nIn Linux, most of these drivers are supported directly by the Linux kernel. Which means its more like plug and play for Linux, no struggling with drivers, largely.\n\nWelcome to Linux world. There is a Linux OS for everyone. Most of the Linux OS does not require a heavyweight computer system. But even if your system is one of those of late 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s, there are plenty of lightweight distributions.In other words, hardware is no constraint for Linux OS.\n\nWhen it comes to looks, desktop Linux rules over Windows. Be it Unity, Cinnamon,Gnome 3, KDE or even low end desktop environments like Xfce or Lxde, they are much more good looking than the Windows desktop. So if you think Linux desktop to be a plain boring and dull looking, you are definitely wrong. Best of all, you can choose a desktop flavor according to your choice.\n\nUpdates in Linux is a like a cool breeze. You will be regularly notified that updates are available. And these updates include not just system and security updates but available updates for different applications installed. Updating in desktop Linux is a matter of one click"

        "text": "Throughout history we\u2019ve always imagined what it\u2019s like to have a robot at our homes, offices, and schools. But why?\n\nI\u2019m specifically talking about the human-sized robots, not the ones you see in factories, not the ones in cars, or the software only AI. I\u2019m talking robot hardware powered by advanced AI.\n\nAre we that lazy that we can\u2019t get up to grab a beer? I think not. There must be a bigger cause, a bigger message to why we need robots.\n\nThe obvious starting point is elderly care. People who are actually unable to get up to get the medications, open the door, or sweep the floor, do need robots. We should maybe persue making robots only for this reason because one day, we\u2019ll all be old and we\u2019ll all need a helping hand.\n\nAnother obvious need for robots is to help with disaster situations, hence the DARPA robotics challenge. Here robots could go places where humans can\u2019t and eventually save us. In this situation we might depend on robots since they will eventually be more efficient than us at this job.\n\nGetting to that point requires time, a lot of time. What if we could have robots that do simple things, think of the roomba. A single function robot that could perform a task, very poorly to say the least, that most of us despite doing. Could we build on that dream and build a sophisticated robot that will navigate indoors, perform simple tasks, entertain us, and start there?\n\nWhat would the user interface be like? because surely voice-commands are not where we\u2019d like them to be, sometimes more frustrating that helpful.\n\nIn that sense, do we need robots?"

        "text": "Competition in the foodservice industry is growing and it\u2019s important for restaurants to excite their customers with new technologies. Here\u2019s a quick look at the recent innovations that help restaurants deliver better dining experience to their existing customers while encouraging new ones.\n\nFood pre-ordering is one of the most trending technologies for restaurants right now. It lets customers to order ahead and avoid waiting at restaurants. Diners can be in and out of a restaurant in less than 15 minutes.\n\nIn turn, online food pre-ordering means less hassle for restaurant owners. It eliminates time wasted on telephone calls, which is one less concern for busy employees.\n\nPre-ordering helps restaurants increase table turnover and deliver better customer experience. Starbucks, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut already have pre-ordering on their mobile apps.\n\nFood pre-orders are usually paid in advance before they make it to the customers. This means growth in sales since a pre-order is a guaranteed table of diners for a restaurant.\n\nService like Allset goes a step further and helps restaurants sell prepaid meals along with prepaid tables. Allset is a reservation app that lets customers pre-order breakfasts and lunches at participating restaurants so that table and meals are ready when customers arrive. Allset is the first service to offer a hybrid \u201ctable booking + food pre-ordering\u201d approach. It helps restaurants sell in advance and increase table turnover.\n\nTable booking is another technology that shows your understanding of the importance of your customers\u2019 convenience. OpenTable is the leading provider of online reservations that helps restaurants deliver great user experience and manage the flow of their customers.\n\nMany restaurants use reservation systems to keep their tables filled. Restaurants can expectedly sell more tables if customers can make reservations with their smartphones.\n\nTable booking apps also allow restaurants to pay closer attention to customers and remember their preferences. When a customer makes reservation via mobile app, a restaurant will remember who the guest is and have an opportunity to create a lasting relationship. For that matter, table booking apps are becoming more of a personal concierge service for diners.\n\nMobile payment technology has become an integral part of everyone\u2019s life, and this is just the beginning of its impact. This is why restaurants should re-think the way they settle their bills.\n\nApps like Cover and Dash make the process of paying easy and pain-free for both restaurant and customer. Restaurant employees can focus more on providing better service and worry less about running checks and handling credit cards during busy hours. It means faster turnarounds for restaurants and better experience for customers.\n\nWhy else should we embrace mobile check payment? Because it\u2019s a proven way to attract millennials to restaurant. Millennials are obsessed with their smartphones and they are often the early adopters of new technologies. For these folks, dining already became mobile.\n\nThe restaurant delivery space is getting more and more crowded. It\u2019s hard to find a restaurant that does not provide delivery service, especially the one where customers place order over the phone. Let\u2019s consider the business model of partnership between restaurant and food delivery apps, like Caviar and Postmates.\n\nWith food delivery services, restaurants have obvious advantages of not having to hire additional employees, handle delivery logistics, and take care of customer service.\n\nYour business can reach a larger audience as food delivery apps will get your food and your restaurant menus straight to your customers.\n\nBusy people and millennials are the driving force behind the delivery trend, and restaurant\u2019s ability to deliver food to their office or home are more valued than ever. Everyone is busier now and more and more people just want to slide their laptops a few inches forward and have their meals on the desk.\n\nThis Forbes shows how food delivery services work. Maybe it\u2019s high time to bring your restaurant onboard.\n\nServices like Yelp and Foursquare put your restaurant on the map customized by user\u2019s preferences. These restaurant-finding apps help people locate your restaurant if they are near you or if your menus match their interests and tastes.\n\nRestaurant operators can set up their business accounts to showcase their restaurants to millions of people that use review and recommendation services to find new great places to try out.\n\nEvery review, photo, or tag adds keywords to your restaurant and improves your search performance and exposure. The more contents that are related to your restaurant there are, the more your restaurant shows up in searches. Create a strong public profile, add photos of your restaurant and menus, respond to customer reviews, and just let the word of mouth take care of the marketing."

        "title": "5 Top Mistakes in Mobile Application Marketing that you can Avoid",
        "text": "The mobile platform influences people considerably and is now an integral part of their decision making process. The sheer size of the target group that the mobile phone user base provides for businesses is a great reason alone to use the platform as a powerful marketing tool. However, in the case of mobile application marketing, a degree of caution needs to be exercised as it is an immensely personal medium. If not well thought-out, marketing strategy can very well backfire. Here are some mistakes and how to avoid them:\n\n#1 \u2014 Assuming that mobiles are same as desktops\n\nMarketing for the mobile platform does not just mean shrinking the desktop version of your marketing efforts to make it fit the display size of mobile phones. The mobile platform is uniquely different and considerations should be made while devising marketing efforts for it. Mobile marketing pages need to have more minimalistic design, not the elaborate kind of design you are likely to use for desktop versions. The user interface should be such that the input of information is easy and intuitive and does not feel like hard work. Try driving focus on important areas and avoid cramming too much information or design elements closely together.\n\n#2 \u2014 Going into app marketing without a plan\n\nPlanning to market an app the right way is an integral part of the process of building and launching an app, and should always be treated as such. It is a common mistake to launch an app and then start planning about how to promote it. Ideally, you should be ready with a concrete and comprehensive plan to market your app before your launch it for public use. Use all the resources you have including existing web presences, social media, SEO and every other kind of marketing tool to their best effect for good results.\n\nMobile websites require a browser and an active internet connection to open. Mobile apps are native to your devices and bring a new level of functionality and feature set to the table. While developing an app, it can be a crucial mistake to pass off a wrapped up mobile website as an app. Instead, try to focus on native features. If development is expensive, focus on one particular platform and make profit out of it. You can always port your app to other platforms later.\n\n#4 \u2014 Ignoring customers\u2019 need to recall and return\n\nCustomers should never be taken for granted, and it is a grave mistake to assume that anyone is going to come back to your offering without a strong reason or incentive. Make sure that your app has recall value and addresses a specific customer need. Focus your efforts on customer retention to make sure that you do not lose customers.\n\nSince the mobile is a personal platform, you must pay careful attention to the demographics of your customer base. You need complete awareness of the kind of people who are most likely to use your app and give customers an easy way to provide feedback on the services you provide. Loyal customers need rewards and thanking them in kind for their loyalty is a wise thing to do."

        "text": "I recently watched the film Ex Machina. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thriller, a sci-fi, a mystery, or a something in between film. The basic plot follows a Turing test between an employee for a grandiose company, and a machine invented by that companies founder. A machine that appears to be able to think, feel, imagine, create and dream just like a human being. I won\u2019t get into anymore of the plot, as the administration of this test is one of the best points of the film, but the combination between human consciousness, our minds, and cyborg like augmentations to our bodies is becoming a growing topic. Where this comes to mind more is how augmentation would play into how many perceive the existence of true Artificial Intelligence. Even brilliant scientists like Stephen Hawking and those knowledgeable within the software industry like Bill Gates.\n\nMy proposal is that we lay within sight of our solution: cybernetic augmentation. I feel like the biggest fear comes from the natural computers we are born with, our brains. Currently the reigning champion for the greatest computer ever created, nature did a pretty good job at designing a processing tool that can control so much, solve problems so quickly, and function intelligently on levels we have yet to achieve with our technology. The thing is, we are getting closer and closer to beating ourselves as we build more efficient machines and better algorithms for decision making. The problem is, human brains are stagnant. They haven\u2019t changed much for the past 10,000 years or so, and technology as in the span of less than 100 almost caught up. To be able to think as well as computers, we are going to need to be able to upgrade as fast as they do.\n\nModern cognitive psychology outlines the brain very much like a computer, with one of biggest strengths being that humans are active information processors. We are always processing, even in rest we exercise our ability to do so because of the phenomenon\u2019s nature as a critical piece to our functioning and survival. What computer scientists and neurologists alike seem to be working towards is a combination of these two mediums for information processing so that our natural ones become stronger in some aspect. Perhaps the biological algorithms that account for memory could be improved so our long term memory were not only more efficient in storage, but in recollection as well. Computers have a distinct advantage of being able to quickly locate the information they need. This is one area that our brains must be able to evolve in if humans are to stay in competition with machines. The best part though, is that this idea of human mental augmentation is not for some terminator like war of man vs machine. Rather it would create a symbiotic relationship between two intelligent beings. As we evolved, we could find ways for them to.\n\nNow there are a lot of other things that need to be considered when talking about bridging human consciousness with that of a machine. Things like emotion, feeling, dreams, all are very complex and we still have very little idea on how these can translate to a computer, if they can at all. As well, ethics to the possibility of installing hardware and software to a human mind, prospects of privacy, even freewill, certainly need discussion, and we\u2019re year away from even needing to consider the possibilities of this.\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the future is coming, and it\u2019s already presenting concepts we have barely begun to have discussion on. Still, the consideration to solutions is necessary. Even when the solution would seem crazy, and it certainly is a bit off in the way we think of the problem. None the less, perhaps the best way for humanity to survive the robot revolution, is to embrace it."

Yes, you can use your current smartphone as a wifi hotspot.\n\nBut, Wifi hotspot burns through the battery of your smartphone pretty quickly. Now that can be problematic for some people as smartphone batteries are already not keeping up with our expectations.\n\nHowever, using an old smartphone as a wifi hotspot doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. Simply connect it to a charger so it stays charged, turn on the hotspot and you are good to go.\n\nTime is important to each of us. Sadly, smartphones have reduced the number of people who used to wear wrist watches significantly.\n\nNevertheless, you can take the revenge through your old smartphone, by using it as a table clock or better yet, as an alarm clock. There are apps (Night Clock, Alarm Clock free and more) which will put a giant analogue or digital clock on your smartphones screen and turn it into a beautiful table clock.\n\nPut it on your desk, change the watch face everyday and experience a new table clock every time you look at it.\n\nSmartphones are powerful devices and Android devices in particular can be used for this purpose.\n\nAs Android devices can easily be connected to a PC and many of them have the luxury of SD card slot, they perfectly fit the criteria here.\n\nSimply pop in the SD card and you have your very own external hard drive. Store your music library or stock up on your photos. Bigger the SD card, the bigger is your storage space.\n\nAnd this homemade external drive can also go an extra mile in the way that you can transfer these files from one device to another via Bluetooth or Wifi.\n\nAs smartphones are becoming more common, media consumption has gone through the roof.\n\nPeople don\u2019t need laptops or dvd players to watch a movie anymore. They don\u2019t need to buy a point and shoot camera when the one on their phone can do the job.\n\nMp3 players have gone out of existence and as book readers are available in abundance on the app stores, even book reading has multiplied on smartphones.\n\nSo, while you store all your movies, photos, music and books on your aged smartphone, why not use its screen to watch and read them as well.\n\nActually, it really depends on the screen size of your phone but still, something is better than nothing, right?\n\nLast but not the least, you can use your vintage smartphone as a photo frame and put it on your desk or bedside table.\n\nMany Android devices now support a daydream feature which streams your photos to the home screen. Or you can also download an app (Dayframe) from the Play store serving the same function.\n\nPut it on your desk and view those incredible memories flow right in front of your eyes.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for, pull out that smartphone, you used years ago and put it to to some good use.\n\nOr if you already do it in some way that I didn\u2019t mention here, do share it in the comments."

Inspired by a waffle iron, this \u2018waggle\u2019 iron cranks out four biscuits every 8 minutes. Toss those preservative-laced, stale, boxed factory-made bones away and give your pets the reward they deserve, all for pennies per treat!\n\nBut they\u2019re not just for dogs anymore. Drowning Book has uncovered a number of similar appliances that have hit the market, designed to cash in on this custom-baked treat craze.\n\nHere are just a few:\n\nOffered with no contract or credit check, featuring nationwide coverage. Phone operates \u00c0 Text, Data, or Voice La Mode. Interchangeable skins offer a variety of taste profiles: The SIM (Sticky Icebox Meringue) version features a shell filled with your choice of custard, fruit, or mousse apps. The savory PHYLLO (Phone Has You Literally Licking Outlandishly) versions come filled with cheese or seafood tapenades, and are served as appetizers. Pre-Paid and Share Everything plans available with free nationwide shipping.\n\nInspired by the \u2018Schittchen\u2019 or \u2018Stollen\u2019, of the Thuringia region Germany, home to the ceramic version that stands guard in lawns and gardens everywhere, this pastry is sure to charm. Said to help in the garden at night, though what they help with is not exactly clear. Often the object of pranks, \u2018gnoming\u2019, as it is called, they are abducted and \u2018returned to the wild\u2019, generally for a token ransom. The offended traditionally first send a note to the kidnappers which must declare in these words, \u2018We have Schittchen Stollen! We are prepared to pay\u2019. This signals the perpetrators to come to dinner, where the ornament is returned, the fresh buttery cakes, densely freckled with nuts, currants and candied orange peel are shared over coffee, and all is forgiven.\n\nThis confection comes in either male or female varieties, and eating just one causes the release of attractants that will interest members of the opposite sex. Or the same sex, depending. Inspired by French and Italian baking methods, some combinations of which have a long history, these dainties follow in the macaron tradition of two featherlight layers held together with a buttercream of vomeronasal stimulants. In some, these confections promote the marking of territory with the crumbs of additional cookies, these trails also serving to guide potential partners through crowded nightclubs, bars, restaurants and amusement parks to the scent\u2019s excreter. They are available only by subscription with proof of age, and delivered via mail in plain brown envelopes. Use in ring-toss games not recommended.\n\nAfter eating one, it\u2019s said that anything the character Rocky Balboa says is understandable, and in fact, profound. A person eating two a day for a week will notice a desire to forsake retirement, to box, and do one\u2019s own stunts in action movies, along with an increase in muscle mass and reduced body fat. This delight features a custard, marscapone and espresso mixture molded into a tiramisu-inspired caricature of the actor\u2019s face, and baked in a wood-fired version of the appliance.\n\nThis is one treat that\u2019s not for eating. A variety of recipes combine ingredients that treat dry or dull hair, frizz, flaky scalp, or sun damage, adding in body and wave, sheen and manageability. One recipe, \u2018Trump Card\u2019, keeps combovers in place. Endorsed by The Donald.\n\nGuided by angels to deliver France from the invading British, Joan of Arc may have experienced delusions from drinking unpasteurized milk as a young girl. Of course, nothing goes with milk like cookies. A p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux is baked in the appliance, the puff-pastry dough\u2019s voids stuffed with a secret Coulis, a fruity bravoure that will motivate you to storm the battlements of invading armies while deflecting cannonballs off your helmet, and taking legions of enemy forces in surrender. During the holidays, the pastry is glazed with hard caramel, in honor of Joan\u2019s armor.\n\nHere\u2019s a treat that can be piloted remotely, from any smartphone, and sent to neighbors\u2019 or friends\u2019 homes as an RSVP, apology, gift, oblation, or peace offering. Features a Marzipan fuselage with a Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche-filled cockpit, nougatine wing-flaps and miniature dried-fig landing gear. Runs on two \u2018AA\u2019 batteries, not included and not edible (the batteries); hand-launched.\n\nIt\u2019s said that Italians talk with their hands. What better way to express one\u2019s concern, disgust, angst, loathing, confusion, perplexity, or displeasure than with this edible, life-sized gesture. Beneath the thin, yet crusty shell, this confection\u2019s texture is soft, yet flaky, inspired by the Sfogliatella Riccia of the Naples region, with a similar filling of and candied orange peel infused with a measure of Campari to ever-so-slightly \u201csi rimane con l\u2019amaro in bocca\u201d (\u2018leave a bad taste in the mouth\u2019) , the whole dusted with confectioner\u2019s sugar.

        "text": "As we process the rollout of Apple Music, it\u2019s a good time to review what a music disabling disaster iTunes has been and prepare ourselves for further disappointment even as we admit room for, God willing, pleasant surprise.\n\nMy complaint is not about compensation for artists, as widely discussed and important as that is. It\u2019s about a music ecosystem that hurts music and the music business and which we (supposedly empowered music fans) have little influence to improve. Digital music platforms should be innovating and competing on their ability to inform and inspire, yet by conforming to the iTunes framework, which prejudices popular music over art music, they\u2019ve done long term harm to our culture\u2019s music literacy and curiosity.\n\nThe software that revolutionized and set the template for digital music was launched on January 9, 2001. In the years since, mankind has mapped the human genome, discovered hundreds of exoplanets and developed 3D printing. Apple itself propagated the iPhone, an epochal technological achievement. Meanwhile, through 12 major versions and a seemingly infinite number of intrusive micro-updates (what part of \u201cdo not ask me again\u201d does Apple not understand?), iTunes got a bit better and then a lot worse.\n\nI\u2019ll spare you my peeves about iTunes functionality and design, because they\u2019re not Apple\u2019s gravest crimes against music. Those would be two, inter-related sins of omission and inexplicable neglect. First is that Apple taught the world that it\u2019s okay to build a music platform free of information, context, history or musical connections. And worse still, the way Apple organized music for searching, shopping and collection discriminates against and marginalizes the most artistically important and inventive fields of music, notably classical, jazz and their contemporary manifestations.\n\nHow we interface with and manage music is no small thing. Life\u2019s a dance between the music we cherish, the music we\u2019re presently discovering and the music we don\u2019t yet know. Over the decades, our possible touch points have been varied and potent. There have always been public spaces like concert venues and record stores where we mingle with other music people. When it\u2019s not corporate crap, radio puts music in context and stages it in a theater of the mind. Most personal are our collections, in whatever form they take. Particularly iconic and influential were crates of LPs handed down within families and the LPs themselves with graphics and liner notes. Even CD booklets, challenging as they can be to the eyes, provide deep information about most consequential recordings.\n\nAll of these were good and evangelical, especially liner notes, which unlocked rooms in the mansion of music for generations. In jazz especially (for me), album notes by experts, evangelists and sometimes artists themselves gave me insight and patience to listen to new terrain. They told me what to listen for and offered information about who made the music and what else they\u2019d done and who else they\u2019d made music with. Names kept popping up on various recordings, and a journey into jazz and other sophisticated music was often a game of hopscotch and association based on and building on knowledge from other liner notes.\n\nAlas, none of those tactile and qualitative factors have been successfully modeled by iTunes or its streaming brethren. iTunes does allow albums to be attached to PDF booklets, but this proved incredibly spotty and unsatisfying. I bought Miles Davis\u2019s Kind of Blue on iTunes, but it didn\u2019t come with any notes, and Kind of Blue without the Bill Evans jacket essay and personnel information, while still a lovely recording, is a music explorer\u2019s dead end. Those notes on the LP jacket helped change my life when I got hold of the seminal album in my teens.\n\nSpotify, my platform of choice for day to day digital listening, is a more workable, fluid and searchable environment with access at least to short biographies of significant artists. By and large it has carried on iTunes\u2019 indifference to information. Session and personnel facts are nowhere in sight. I can\u2019t look up who wrote a song or piece. Album covers can\u2019t be enlarged (which would be a huge help for classical music) and release dates \u2014 the one bit of data Spotify deigns to display \u2014 are generally absurdly and deceptively incorrect. Placing major artists\u2019 catalogs in chronological order seems like something the interns could do.\n\nAdding insult to injury, we\u2019ve been promised wonders in the music information/story space. Years ago some guys from one of the major labels came to the Nashville Digital Summit to talk about their plans for an interactive album experience. There were supposed to be new hybrids of box sets, coffee table books and museum exhibits built for iPads and tablets. But it\u2019s all been a big disappointment. Indeed the big music companies seem set now on a model that encourages us to forget music history, save for a few safe lifetime achievement winners, so we think harder about spending on the new. This isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s fault, but you\u2019d think their engineers and designers could have come up with an interface that offered insight into the music. Instead we got new versions of Visualizer. Trippy, but not inclined to make a deeper music fan.\n\nHere\u2019s where the trouble started and where it remains. Even most music lovers are unaware of the damage done by the archetypal iTunes classification system of Artist, Title, Album (ATA). I have no idea who or what processes led to this narrow trio of variables, but once fixed, it proliferated across the digital music services. And that\u2019s how ATA broke the world. Because it\u2019s a framework that only works for popular music, where songs are the unit of delivery and albums are the most acceptable and widespread mode of bundling said units.\n\nIt becomes quickly obvious on reflection that ATA breaks when applied to other approaches to music-making, including the mega-genres of jazz and classical. Pop music was supposed to be a side trip from music music, but for various reasons it wound up crowding out instrumental and composed music entirely \u2014 in the media, in the dwindling record stores, even at the level of symphonies being forced to play with pop singers just to keep the doors open. In the digital space, deep, art-based music, while present, is organized so inadequately as to barely exist. And ATA is one big reason.\n\nAmerica is full of young and otherwise contemporary composers and instrumentalists, opera singers and conceptual producers who don\u2019t do \u201csongs\u201d and who work with so many collaborators that it\u2019s almost never clear who the \u201cartist\u201d is. There should be room to credit (and search by) composers, conductors, ensembles and soloists. Jazz recordings may have an \u201cartist\u201d as a leader, but the particular chemistry of the side musicians and the producer is seminal to the nature and sound of the session. Some of us would like to know about producers and engineers. Catalog hopping is much harder than it used to be. Just today I was enjoying an Avashai Cohen album and I wanted to know who the guitar player was and that\u2019s difficult to find out on the open internet. It\u2019s not even hinted at within the Spotify system. It\u2019s ATA all the way.\n\nThe cumulative neglect here is staggering, marginalizing many of America\u2019s genius level musical creators from the dawn of recorded sound through today. Lost or obscured are the big bands and the chamber ensembles and world music collectives. Lost are the cross-over hybrid masters whose work falls between genres. Lost are the young composers and instrumentalists who had the gall and the nerve to choose a path in sophisticated music in a post-MTV world. We\u2019re missing music with movements and music of long durations with mingled ensembles. America doesn\u2019t ignore this canon and its own musical heritage and ferment because it doesn\u2019t like it. It doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s there.\n\nI have it from a knowledgeable source that the team working on iTunes at the beginning knew full well it was launching with inadequate metadata for entire fields of music, especially classical. They went ahead anyway.\n\nWhen I talk to music industry folks about the information desert of digital music (and radio), I generally get either a yawn or a rationale. Classical and jazz are a mere 5% of the market, they\u2019ll remind me. It\u2019s too small an audience to merit a reorganization of our whole digital musical system. Even in the context of popular music, important journalists and record executives have told me that \u2018we music freaks (wink) are not like the mass public.\u2019 I\u2019m told my hunger for information, about songwriters and composers, about sidemen and conductors, about location and accurate dates, about commentary and criticism is just too rare to be a problem.\n\nBesides being patronizing and cynical, this is the definition of a self-fulfilling prophecy. There was a time when information about recordings was abundant and included on and inside those record sleeves. They served to sell the recording when it was in the bin. They gave the listener an orientation while listening. They created touch points that would become connections later on as dots connected and a picture of the big sprawling musical world took shape for each individual listener. Is it mere coincidence that that era produced giants who crossed among genres like Leonard Bernstein and Miles Davis? Or complex, elegant pop music like Stevie Wonder and Steely Dan? I don\u2019t think so. I believe their successes were products of an information rich musical America.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t feed the mind as well as the ears, we make temporarily engaged consumers of a lifestyle product, not music lovers. If we offer information, while not everyone will avail themselves of it, those who do will become the evangelists and explainers in their families and communities. Casual fans will always be one glance away from a thread that they\u2019d otherwise have not pulled or a rabbit hole they\u2019d otherwise have blown past. Some percentage of those so engaged will become the super-fans. Music geeks and freaks are an essential part of a music ecosystem, and it\u2019s harder to become one now. Similarly, innovative and complex art music plus deep classical traditions are necessary to raise the bar for all music, including popular forms. Studies have suggested that pop music has grown less complex harmonically in the decades since the liner note and enriched musical experience peaked, and my own observations bear that out.\n\nYou could argue that I should just be motivated enough to use the web while I listen. I could find complete biographies and discographies on Wikipedia and AllMusic. I can puddle jump through associated artists on YouTube. I can look up great albums on AlbumLinerNotes.com.\n\nAnd I could ask you to go eat your appetizer at one restaurant known for its small plates and get up and drive across town for a place with good entrees. Of course we have the option of a self-guided tour, but that\u2019s not a good way to get started in an intimidating genre or stay focused on a recording while listening. Most iTunes users I daresay have never heard of AllMusic in any event. What worked for decades was bundling the information with the product itself. Listen. Look. Learn. And what\u2019s all this development and code and technology for if not to make the best music ecosystem possible? Why have we given up?\n\nI don\u2019t see why this is so complex for the company that made the iPhone and my beloved MacBook Air and living as we do in a world made of data management. We just need a few more fields and variables and industry agreement on a set of common system of metadata that can be the template for a new music business. Apple Music should make it easier for developers to build add-ons, shells or skins to new music ecosystems powered by Apple Music but not tied down to a no-options interface like iTunes. Part of it could be wiki-like, allowing fans to fill in the blanks and contribute their own notes. After all, how many data fields is Apple and the digital entertainment industry keeping on us consumers? That\u2019s where the money and effort has gone \u2014 not to inform and empower us as listeners but to measure and manipulate us as consumers.\n\nAt last, industry players and observers are paying attention to the arcane but vital subject of metadata. This is data about the music and data about the data, best imagined as bits of code that tag along with digital music tracks through all their pipelines. There were days of heated conversation about the subject at this year\u2019s Music Biz conference in Nashville. NPR\u2019s Anastasia Tsioulcas recently dissected the deficits of metadata in classical music. A new company in Nashville called DART has put forth a data conforming solution for today\u2019s classical artists and composers who wish to join the modern music marketplace. They\u2019re raising capital because investors see they may have a framework for filling in blanks about many kinds of music.\n\nMuch is made about how music has been \u201cdevalued,\u201d and usually the culprit is illegal downloading and competing with free. But I can\u2019t think of anything more devaluing than to rip music away from its context and its history. Apple and iTunes abandoned a promising start on an engaging digital music delivery and discovery system rich with information and inspiration. In falling short, it has actually shaped and distorted our shared perception of what music is worthy and valuable. With Apple Music, the company has a huge opportunity to start over and get this right.\n\nCraig Havighurst is an author, writer and media producer in Nashville.

        "text": "Welcome to the part 2 of the article. Here, I will discuss about the rest of the features worth having in your high end smartphone.\n\nAlmost every top of the line smartphone has these, so make sure the one you are buying should include these as well.\n\nHaving a good camera is an essential part of a smartphone experience.\n\nThere is no excuse left for manufacturers to install a mediocre camera on an expensive device.\n\nBut, let\u2019s move ahead of a good camera experience. If you are a camera aficionado, your next device should have \u2018granular camera controls\u2019 built into the camera software.\n\nThese camera controls give you a manual control over the exposure, shutter speed, ISO and white balance etc. Indeed, several manufacturers are integrating these manual controls in their camera softwares. Lg recently did a great job with Lg G4.\n\nTaking selfies was never more fun. Even smartphone manufacturers recognize this and are releasing devices with specialized front camera that can take great selfies.\n\nHeck HTC even released a smartphone, which had the same resolution camera on the front as on the back.\n\nThe wide angle front camera can take a wide image so that you and your friends can easily accommodate in a picture.\n\nI know this is not something for everyone, but why not have the ability to take a great selfie when you need it no matter how seldom it might be.\n\nOIS makes taking images in the dark, a breeze. Even in dimly lit interiors or at night time, images come out bright and look amazing.\n\nNow, we all take a lot of images from our smartphones and they are mostly capable of taking great shots during the daytime. But we also capture shots at night a lot including night time parties and weddings and they don\u2019t come out as well as the ones taken during the daytime.\n\nOIS changes all that and allows you to take beautiful pictures at night time as well. It also makes videos more stable despite shaky hands. So make sure the device you are going to buy does support OIS or you will be let down from its camera in the long run.\n\nNext up on the list is \u2018Quick charge 2.0\u2019 technology, which lets you charge your device extremely fast. With this technology you can recharge 50% of your smartphone\u2019s battery in like half an hour.\n\nComing to wireless charging; it\u2019s all the rage these days and it surely is the technology of the future. It allows you to charge your device wirelessly. All you have to do is to put your device on a charging pad and your smartphone starts to charge.\n\nAlthough, for this to happen, your device should have a chi wireless charging capability built into it. As wireless charging pads are becoming more widely available, you are going be glad your device support the hardware to take advantage of it.\n\nIn the end is the feature that we all terribly need.\n\nA strong and sturdy gorilla glass 4 covering the front of our smartphones, so when we drop it, and we all drop it, we can be sure, that it\u2019s not going to crack up the screen that easily.\n\nGorilla glass 4 is the latest technology that is much sturdier than the gorilla glass 3 that covers almost every smartphone screen that came out last year.\n\nIt is therefore imperative that your device has the best protection possible for its screen, because that is where all the fun happens.\n\nThat concludes the part two of this article. I hope it is helpful for those who are planning on buying a smartphone soon or waiting for the next big thing to get released.\n\nIf I\u2019ve missed a feature that you are looking for in your desired device, do share it with me in the comments.\n\nAlso read: Top 5 features to look for, if you\u2019re buying a high end smartphone this fall (part 1)"

        "text": "Mobile technology has equipped us all with cameras in the form of smartphones.\n\nIt has become our second nature to be in a great moment with friends or family and take out our smart cameras and save that moment forever.\n\nYears of taking pictures results in hundreds and thousands of them, eventually saved to our computers so that we don\u2019t lose them.\n\nBut the question is, what if your laptop is stolen? What if its hard drive burns? What if the memory card on your device gets corrupted and what if you lose your smartphone to theft or you forget it somewhere??\n\nYears of memories lost in an instant! And there will be no easy way to recover them. Or there might be no way at all.\n\nNow consider this; What if you can save your pictures some place safe and private, not only the ones you take on your smartphone, but also those already present on your personal computer without worrying about your smartphone being stolen or your hard drive corrupting.\n\nAnd you can access all of them, at any time, from anywhere and any device.\n\nGoogle Photos previously known as Google+ photos is the latest Photo service launched by Google.\n\nWhat Google Photos does is that it uploads your Photos to the cloud from your smartphones as well as computers. Any photo that you take on your phone is automatically uploaded.\n\nNow there are many other services that offer the same functionality, Dropbox to name one. But Google has managed to beat them all with some jaw dropping offerings in this app.\n\nFirst and foremost, Google Photos is absolutely free. There are no hidden charges as well as no subscription.\n\nSecondly, you can save an unlimited, that\u2019s right, unlimited number of photos and videos in their original quality.\n\nGoogle claims that it saves images of up to 16MP and 1080P videos in their original but compressed printable quality.\n\nEven so, you can still save the photos in their full resolution, but against your Google Drive storage. Google provides 15Gb of Drive storage to every account holder. To do this, simply choose Original format instead of High Quality in the app settings.\n\nGoogle Photos is available on both major mobile platforms, Android and iOS.\n\nFurthermore, there is a web client as well, so you can enjoy your pictures on your laptops from anywhere in the world. All you need is an internet connection and password for your Google account.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the features of the app briefly.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the app and signed in with your Google account, you will notice that the app is divided into three main portions.\n\nThe main page is where all your photos are present, sorted out in a timeline fashion. You can view your photos in four views, i.e. Comfortable view, day view, month view and year view. You can change views from the three dots menu on the top right or by simply pinching to zoom in or out.\n\nSwipe to right and you will enter assistant tab. Here, similar images from your library are converted into beautiful collages, GIFs and stories. Stories are actually these incredible short videos that the app chooses from your uploaded videos and then merge them with the images to make one hell of a short movie.\n\nSwiping to the left from the main page open ups your collections and albums. These are all the images from the same trip or a party grouped together in a storyline fashion.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Google Photos is its search engine which organizes your photos by categories such as people, places and things that matter, for e.g. If you are looking for a photo with a dog in it, simply type dog in the search bar and the app will bring you all the photos with dog in it.\n\nAnd all of this happens automatically without you adding any tags.\n\nLast but not the least, let me highlight its sharing functions which have impressed me the most. You can choose any number of images by long pressing on one image and then sliding down the screen, then press the sharing button and share it to the app of your choice.\n\nIf they are not Google Photos user, they can open the link in a browser and even download all the photos in their original quality if they choose so.\n\nHowever, if they happen to use Google Photos, they will be given the option to save those shared photos to their Google Photos account.\n\nHave a go at it guys, it\u2019s free and you have nothing to lose here. I personally love Google Photos and it has become my new favorite app.\n\nIf you liked what you read in this piece, please press a \u2018recommend\u2019 button down below. Thanks!"

        "text": "I recently attended the Augmented World Expo 2015 (AWE) at the Santa Clara Convention Center. This was my first time, and this year they\u2019ve teamed up with virtual reality and wearables, since all these lines are starting to blur some.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what I learned, in no particular order.\n\nTime and time again, I get burned by sound problems. It happens when I live stream, and it happens when I interview.\n\nI won\u2019t bother sharing the 3 1/2 minute interview I did with the awesome creator of the Mindride Airflow VR experience, since the audio is either loud pops or non-existent. Oh, then my camera battery died mid-day. All of these are squarely my fault.\n\nI\u2019m hoping this little device, plus a quality interview mic and directional mic, will solve things, and cover me for a variety of situations: meetups, interviews, and podcasts. Kent Bye with the Voices of VR Podcast delivers at a level of quality we should all aspire to. I\u2019m working on it.\n\nThis was the first thing you encountered upon entering the VR area of AWE2015:\n\nI was anxious to try, and was pleased to learn there were spots still available when I got there, but ultimately took a pass because of ongoing chiropractic issues. It reminded me of my Birdly experience from last summer. Some people said it was fun but not groundbreaking, which is essentially what I felt about Birdly. Regardless, I continue to be excited by these fusions of art and virtual reality tech, and look forward to what these creative innovators come up with next.\n\n3. There are a lot of augmented reality devices.\n\nCan you name one? (Besides HoloLens, which wasn\u2019t even at AWE2015). No?\n\nOptinvent announced their ORA-X. ODG announced their R-7 glasses. Technical Illusions\u2019 Jeri Ellsworth and Rick Johnson were there showing CastAR (of which I\u2019m a Kickstarter backer), along with Meta showing the Meta 1, Atheer Labs, and lots of others. They\u2019re out there and are being used for serious business. You just haven\u2019t heard about them, because\u2026\n\nThey\u2019re awkward and glitchy and expensive and not \u201cfun\u201d.\n\nCompanies like ScopeAR are able to gain traction by solving problems that save money. In the case of their RemoteAR product, for example, they\u2019re able to demonstrate how an expert employed by the company (but not at the location where there\u2019s a problem) can help troubleshoot and solve an issue using augmented reality. In a situation where human error can result in significant downtime, financial loss, and safety hazard, technology like this can be attractive to an enterprise.\n\n5. Eye tracking is a thing for the DK2 now, and it works pretty well.\n\nOur friends at Altspace were demonstrating eye-tracking technology using an upgraded Oculus Rift DK2. SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) was on-hand in the Altspace booth showing off their eye tracking HMD upgrade package for DK2.\n\nBruce Wooden, head of developer and community relations for Altspace, walked me through the demo in-world. After a quick one-gaze calibration (SMI also has a zero-calibration option), my avatar was escorted to a mirror.\n\nAs I moved my eyes within the Oculus DK2 headset, my actions are modeled on my avatar.\n\nNext, we launched a web browser and navigated to YouTube. From the YouTube home screen, I was able to \u201chover over\u201d links on the page using only my eyes, then click using the mouse. The sensor and software were surprisingly adept at reading my eye movements without being overly twitchy.\n\nDon\u2019t plan on picking up this eye-tracking upgrade for yourself, though. They run $15,000, and I\u2019m willing to pay\u2026 somewhat less than that. I left with the impression SMI is more interested in attracting a hardware vendor than turning it into a retail product.\n\n6. Remote presence at conferences and expos is a thing now, and it works pretty well.\n\nI noticed these wheeling around as soon as I arrived. There was a collection(?) \u2014 what\u2019s a group of remote presence robots called? \u2014 of them arrayed behind the first few rows of the day 2 press conference. Some had faces showing on their screens, others had offices or conference rooms.\n\nThe ones at AWE2015 were a little beefier than the iPad-on-a-Segway versions I\u2019ve seen other places, and are better adapted for pushing through expo crowds if necessary.\n\nSince I was on-site, I asked Cubicle Ninjas\u2019 Joshua Farkas, who tweeted that he attended via the Beam Pro, what his experience was.\n\nBrian: How easy was it to connect up and start driving around?\n\nJosh: The set-up process was as simple as downloading an app and logging in. It really couldn\u2019t have been more seamless.\n\nBrian: What was the reaction to your robotic avatar?\n\nJosh: Everyone at the dojo thought I was crazy when I mentioned the idea. But the natural skepticism turned into pure joy as they drove around, met others, and learned about the tech. It was delightful.\n\nBrian: How was the overall experience? Besides not being able to demo, was it a reasonable substitute to being here?\n\nJosh: For AWE specifically, the lack of demo-ing makes being there a must. But to talk to passionate people, learn about new technology, ask questions, and have fun doing so from the comforts of your desk, it really can\u2019t be beat. If you\u2019re looking to get a sense of an event at a fraction of the cost it is highly recommended."

Then, somebody could either have a good time or get their ankle broke. It could happen. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\n\nAssumeba keeps people from jumping to conclusions. Deployed in courthouses, it blocks the exits of jury boxes if the sworn have reached verdicts prematurely. Has special rubber wheels to help grip the slippery slope of illogical reasoning. Ejects copies of the judge\u2019s revised instructions to the jury, when needed, from a slot on top.\n\nBloomba was a secret droid employed by the New York City Police Department during the tenure of Michael Bloomberg. Funded by Hizzoner himself, Bloombas patrolled the streets of the Five Boroughs, seeking any discarded soda cups larger than 16 oz., or any containers yielding remnants of infant formula. The bots would send the GPS coordinates to headquarters and cordon off the area until officers responded.\n\nDoomba owners who play the online game Doom follow this robot during its cleaning chores, hoping for clues to movements through the 8+1 levels of Phobos, Deimos and Hell. Doombas are easily networked for multiplayer engagements. Deathmatch Mode is supported with the addition of Swiffer WetJet Power Pads for cleaning up blood.\n\nLumumba roams the countryside of the Congo, gathering from the ground the splinters of the violated young bones of the country\u2019s first elected, and promptly assassinated Prime Minister, along with scraps of the dashed early hopes of Pan-Africanism. Powered by the memories of the complicity of the Belgian, American, and British governments and the lesson of Cold War hysteria.\n\nToomba was interred with Royals in ancient Egypt. The device was powered by 50 large scarab beetles pushing the unit\u2019s dung-ball wheels in the manner the insect\u2019s god Khepera pushed the sun and moon across the sky. It was believed to vacuum up the clouds from the day and the stars from the night to comfort and illuminate the spirits of the nobles on their journeys through the Afterlife.\n\nRoombaba differs from a Roomba only in that it is soaked in rum. It\u2019s central to a party game in which contestants chase after the robot on all fours, licking the pastry-filled center of the device. The individual efforts are timed, with points deducted for collisions with furniture.\n\nSis-Boom-Bah was a 19th century steam-powered band of robotic musicians, their (very loud) melodies variations on the popular cheerleading chant of the day: \u2018sis\u2019 (skyrocket flight), \u2018boom\u2019 (airburst) and \u2018ah!\u2019(crowd reaction). They were added as the finale to street parades during 4thof July celebrations, but were quickly banned for terrifying draft horses and flattening cakes baking in ovens along the route.\n\nBazoomba is the exploitive, crass street name for a fruit and vegetable-cleaning robot whose funnel-shaped vacuum attachment is used, against the advice of the manufacturer, to enlarge aspects of human anatomy.\n\nNomdeplumeba is a robot that senses gender-specific marketing hazards and assigns pen names to authors seeking to conceal their identities. A female bot, it\u2019s actually marketed under the pseudonym \u201cN.D.Ploomba\u2019. Endorsed by the estate of Dr. Seuss, the George Eliot Foundation, and J.K. Rowling.\n\nVroomba travels the floorspace of airline flight simulators. Synchronized with the throttle controls, makes a \u2018vrooom, vrooom\u2019 sound with the aid of synthetic lips to add realism to the experience for pilots-in-training.\n\nDave Petraglia lives to document the contradictions, the dualities, the yin-yang of the complexities of modern and ancient life, and discover daily new ways to prepare black-eyed peas.

There are a number of leading apps which have been successful in exploiting this trend, and currently enjoy a huge user base courtesy the features and functionality they bring to the table. These apps usually sport a range of added features including those of changing the look and feel of the messaging environment, the ability to share different kinds of content among users, and the ability to use third-party services like games and online activities from within the app.\n\nKik is one of the most popular instant messaging solutions for smartphones, available for all leading smartphone platforms like Google\u2019s Android, Apple\u2019s iOS and Windows Mobile. Sporting over 100 million users, Kik is a small and lightweight app, devoid of bloated in-built features. Instead, it has been implementing a system of HTML \u201cCards\u201d for accessing third-party services, which is one of the reasons behind its immense popularity. Now, with their latest update, Kik has implemented an integrated browser to the app, which is sure to be a welcome move with both users and developers.\n\nThe New Integrated Browser with Kik\n\nAccording to reports, the new update for Kik contains a major change that might prove to be vehicle for additional use and popularity for Kik over the years. An in-built browser has been added to the app, the rest of which remain more or less the same. The slide-in menu in Kik is now set to contain an area where search keywords and URLs can be entered, thereby engaging the browser. This can be used to navigate the internet, locate content and perform actions based on the returned results.\n\nFor users, this means the ability to easily access, consume and share data and media from the internet without having to leave the app environment. It also becomes possible for users to take a look at data shared by other users, again without having to exit the app and opening another browser. This makes for easier and more intuitive use of the app in terms of social interactions.\n\nFor developers, this update opens up greater possibilities of adding value to users. This is a sign that Kik is closing in on becoming a platform for web app development. The new browser is meant to be a replacement for the HTML \u201cCards\u201d system that Kik had implemented, and Kik is also releasing a set of APIs which would enable developers to very easily create new applications and port existing ones to Kik, in a manner which lets users use these applications from within the app.\n\nWebsites and developers can easily port their existing web content and apps to Kik, thereby giving users a native app-like experience for third party services. Kik plans to work closely with different brands and developers to bring a lot more content into the realm of Kik, and to significantly add to the user experience. The APIs are set to be available for free, and will be a lucrative prospect for websites and developers, due to the huge user base and popularity which Kik already has."

        "text": "Two years ago, my wife\u2019s 12 year old brother disappeared. He was like my own little brother, having gotten into pranks, fights, basketball games, and family trips with him over the years. He just up and disappeared\u2026\n\nRecently though, he resurfaced on Instagram, and inevitably, Snapchat. A teenager caught in the wave of the ephemeral and the secret, Johnny escaped the public arena of Facebook once his sisters and mom started commenting on his posts.\n\nAnd his safe haven? Instagram and Snapchat. There, he began posting pictures of his teenage angsts, his frustrations living in China, his hoop dreams, his love of the new Camaro his dad bought him. All hidden from his family because they weren\u2019t on them.\n\nAbout the same time I discovered Johnny\u2019s re-emergence, I came across case studies where other teenagers were adapting to parental interference on their newsfeeds. In one situation, a girl began using code phrases to throw off her mother. She posted a quote from \u201cBrian\u2019s Song\u201d with happy lyrics. Her mother followed up with a message of pleasure that her daughter was having a great day. Meanwhile, her friends recognized the lyrics referred to a depressing moment in the movie, prompting them to text message her offline with, \u201cAre you okay? Do you want to talk? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nThese two observations converged in my mind with a question: How can we enable people to express themselves publicly but convey the true meaning at the same time? What if every post\u2026had a flipside?\n\nIn the Summer of 2014, Flypfeed was born. I created a prototype on Flinto, pitched it to my friend Khanh, and started on the road to full-fledged app status on the App Store. We decided to code in Swift, Apple\u2019s new programming language, which became both the easiest language to understand and the most difficult to learn. After all, when we started coding, Swift was just announced by Apple and in Beta. As opposed to Objective C, Java, Ruby, and other languages, there just wasn\u2019t much help on the forums. Much of it was trial and error, mapping from Objective C versions to Swift versions, and just hacking away. We also had nil experience with Xcode, about which to this day, I have ample complaints to vent.\n\nToday, after two weeks of anxiety-soaked curiosity, we were approved by both Apple and Facebook. Now, the only thing standing between you, my reading friend, and a download of Flypfeed is my dexterous finger on a big fat \u201cSubmit\u201d button.\n\nSo here\u2019s what Flypfeed is: a social network, newsfeed-based, where you follow people and they follow you. However, every post in the feed can be flipped over to reveal a flipside, just like if you flipped over a card on a poker table. The front side could be the beginning of a joke, and the flipside could be the punchline. The front side could be the \u201cBefore\u201d picture of a party, and the flipside could be the trashed, utterly destructed, friends-strewn-all-over-the-floor \u201cAfter\u201d picture. The front side can be the context for anything you want, and the flipside can be the core message.\n\nIn addition, you get to choose who sees the flipside. You could allow all your followers to see it, or you could give that privilege to only a select group of them. Exclusive access. A hidden message. A secret. And Mom can\u2019t see it.\n\nSo, when are we going to release? Well, right now, Khanh and I are celebrating our app approval by jetting around the world in Japan and Spain, respectively. Just now, as I finished up a cooking class in San Sebastian, I received the following approval message from Facebook:\n\nUpon our return in late June, we\u2019ll decide when to pull the trigger. It will then be available to download from Apple\u2019s App Store."

Smart TVs and Smart Thermostats are already part of many households and its just a matter of time before more fridges, lights and laundry machines get IPv6 addresses and are connected to the Internet.\n\nThese connections are usually done using a WiFi connection to the residential router. Once the Things are connected to the Internet, they individually send and receive information to and from their manufacturers. Essentially, it is a system where each Thing, connected to the Internet, interacts with an application on the Internet (probably in a cloud) and storing the data produced on a database there. Depending on the Thing and the application, it might process some of the data, make some \u2018smart\u2019 decisions, do some reasoning and send feedback or instructions to the Thing. Usually the Thing is equipped with advanced functionality through this Internet connection.\n\nBesides the terrible inefficiency apparent in the whole process, sending everything to a server miles away for processing, whats even worse is that at least some functionality of Things are dependant on their connections to the Internet, their manufacturers continual support of applications and on the integrity of the manufacturers when it comes to privacy and security of the data produced.\n\nAnother undesirable outcome is a phenomenon that is called \u2018the basket of remotes\u2019."

        "text": "I live in Buenos Aires. Every day I drive to work, it\u2019s really not a long journey, however in the last decade the city got really full of cars and any accident or problem could easily double the time of my trip. I usually go by the same route but I always got a couple of alternative routes in mind just in case.\n\nI started using Waze to get driving directions as it estimates the travel time, shows traffic jams and obstacles reported by the community. I think it's a wonderful app, I\u2019m quite a fan of it although I realized that it took me some time to stop thinking and trusting my decisions on this little piece of technology.\n\nAt first, I found myself many times overriding the recommended route by the app and going my own way believing I knew the city better. Once, I crashed after taking a detour from the suggested route \u263a(hopefully no harm done!). After a certain time, I started to trust in the recommendations as it consistently got me faster to destination and now I practically blindly follow its suggestions.\n\nThese personal experiences made me think about our relationship with technology and specifically with expert systems and artificial intelligence. Apps like Waze that assist you on an specific real-life use case will start to appear on different aspects of our decision making.\n\nLet\u2019s see how we got to this.\n\nThe genesis of the Internet consisted on the interconnection of a few computers owned by universities and other organizations for research purposes.\n\nSome years later it took a big leap forward with the creation and popularization of the personal computer as it allowed the network access of millions of devices and with a much more general purpose, closer to the average consumer needs.\n\nThen the Internet developed senses, mobile devices: digital cameras, cellphones, GPS, weather sensors, wearables, etc. collecting information about our everyday life and plugging it to the network. We are the agents that connect the real world to the Internet through these devices, feeding it with a staggering 5 exabytes of data every day from our interaction with the services we use.\n\nSo what will the future look like? The number of sensors will keep growing faster and faster as your home appliances, pets, cars, watches, homes, lights, connects to the network in a concept called the \"Internet of Things\". According to Cisco, there will be around 50 billion \"things\" connected by 2020."

        "title": "How the Newest Google Maps for Android Cost Me At Least an Hour this Weekend",
        "text": "Let me start by saying, I LOVE Google Maps. In fact, I love it so much that shortly after buying my Moto X six months ago, I bought a car bracket for my phone, ditched my old Magellen GPS and now use Google Maps to get me where I want to go.\n\nThis worked great until the newest update.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, some things in the new update are great. I mean, I like the fact that the Google lady now tells me what lane I should be in for the next maneuver. I like the fact that I now get to see, simultaneously on the screen, remaining miles, remaining time and ETA, instead of having to scroll through only one at a time. All good stuff, well worthy of an update.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop there. With the newest update alternate routes are now displayed whenever you are approaching a maneuver where an alternate route will still get you (reasonably) to your destination, including how much time taking said route will add or subtract to your total travel time.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. I said add or subtract. Appearantly the newest update does not feel the need to optimize your trip by shortest travel time! (Before you ask, I do not generally use avoid tolls or avoid highways both of which, quite understandably, can lead to longer travel times. In fact, I have checked my settings and there is absolutely no reason Google Maps should not be optimizing for travel time.)\n\nNot knowing any of this I set out on a Memorial Day road trip one that was going to total, at a minimum thirty-six hours of driving. Much of the trip was heading to places I have been before, so I didn\u2019t need navigation assistance, but I still put my Moto X in it\u2019s bracket and punched my first destination into Google Maps. Cincinnati to North Central PA. I do this, even when I know the way, so that I am aware of things like bad traffic and construction delays, and can route around them.\n\nThe route started out normally, heading me up I-71 to Columbus. In Columbus the Google Maps lady told me to get on I-70 west. I know that continuing on I-71 is about half an hour shorter, but I assume that there is some problem on I-71 that my friends at Google are routing me around. I have the screen off on my phone, so I am following strictly the voice instructions, and I haven\u2019t yet noticed the new \u201calternate route bubbles\u201d (ARBs henceforth).\n\nThings proceed pretty normal for a few hours. I have taken this route before, and I know the next step is PA-66 north from I-70 to US-22 just outside of Altoona PA. Which was precisely what Google Maps told me to do. All was well.\n\nThe next maneuver should have been I-99 north. However, not according to the Maps lady! She sent me north on US-119. Being more than a little concerned, I revive my phone and look at the Google Maps display, noticing that my ETA had slipped by more than an hour since my trip began! I found this disconcerting because I knew that I had only stopped a total of fifteen minutes, and generally drive the speed limit (+4ish).\n\nI decided to keep my screen lit up, and watch Google Maps for more time slippage. It was then that I notice the ARBs. US-119 had a number of exits that could get me to my destination. \u201cThis is interesting,\u201d I thought. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know the impact on my time if I take an alternate route.\u201d\n\nThe next ARB told me that that if I took the next exit, my travel time would be 10 minutes shorter. At that point I conjectured that I had lost an hour because Google Maps had not routed me on the optimal route (by time) and I had failed in my (percieved) duty to watch the ARBs for more optimal routing. I was appalled!\n\nOn the following day, my theory was confirmed when I saw a ARB that showed a 35 minute time savings.\n\nSo, dear reader, if you use the Google Maps Android app to navigate, make sure you pay attention to the ARBs, there is probably a way to save some time on your trip.\n\nAnd Google: If you aren\u2019t going to optimize your routes by time, it would be nice of you to tell us! At the very least the Maps lady should tell you when a better route is available."

It doesn\u2019t matter. I could be excited about kittens or an article I just read, but I can\u2019t share that without logging in.\n\nIf I\u2019m using Buffer, which is a fairly minimal social sharing app, logging in with Facebook and Twitter connect is not a big chore. But it\u2019s still a tool that loves to give me options.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, when I\u2019m working I\u2019m delighted with those options. I let out whoops of joy or have a minor break-down when I check analytics. But when I\u2019m seeing, hearing, playing, thinking and feeling, I don\u2019t need any of that. I want something simple that doesn\u2019t need a login and doesn\u2019t disturb my moment. Just let me post to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and what-have-you. No frills, no frou-frou.\n\nI mentioned this to my husband in a fit of frustration one day (a UX designer and a Rubik\u2019s cube fiend) and before I knew it, he was sold. After a bit of asking around, we found that the idea resonated with other people too.\n\nSo we decided to build it.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of working between his already existing projects Praveen came up with the design for a very minimal app and even hacked together a GIF of what it will look like."

Enough with the metaphors, here\u2019s why.\n\nI have felt for years that the honeymoon phase of smartphone\u2019s + social networking apps was coming to an end. MySpace, Facebook, SnapChat, Twitter, Tumbler, Instagram; there was always some sort of medium (no pun intended Medium) to post your pictures no one cared about, and go off on rants no one gave a shit about. We post things because we can, not because we should. We post things because we can, not because we should. E-Cards, those fucking memes, your food, candy crush invites, whatever political propaganda your favorite weirdo posted that you just had to share with everyone, George Takei.

You are the smartest most enlightening most cultured group of people I have ever interacted with, regardless if I agreed or disagreed, or liked or disliked what you were writing. You put hearts and souls into what you\u2019re writing. Everything on Medium is valid, but I also wanted to contribute as well. I felt I had an opinion and stories to share that might inspire and enlighten others in a way that they have me.\n\nMy last couple posts below lit up Medium and consequently my iPhone like a Christmas Tree:"

Not only do I bring unnecessary amounts of shit (see image), I also shoot an inappropriate and unhealthy amount of photos. On a five to eight day trip I will take anywhere from 1,500-2000 pictures. Now you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201cOf what?\u201d I don\u2019t know, every bathroom I\u2019m in. The bed in the hotel. The pictures on the wall. The breakfast buffet. You name it, I don\u2019t want to forget it. Now in my defense, I believe that\u2019s the reason (forgetting) behind my obsession. I travel a lot for pleasure. That coupled with my terrible memory it\u2019s pretty easy for trips to blend together and remembering what was where, and where was what. Shooting all these pictures helps me remember my travels when I\u2019m reminiscing. I consider this to be a valid point, that being said, I don\u2019t recommend it and below I will explain how to avoid the pickle I\u2019m in.\n\nBack to equipment. The amount of redundant crap a pack in my carry on is obsessive and compulsive to say the least. I have a Nikon D7000 back up in case my D7100 fails. I have a backup point and shoot. I have an emergency underwater camera incase mine fills with water. I have back video cameras, for backup video cameras. SD Cards. SD Card Readers. It\u2019s crazy, I know. But again, I\u2019m a photographer, this is what I do. I can\u2019t help it. What I can help is giving people like you some insight on how to not turn out like me.\n\nAs a photographer you naturally see the aesthetics of the world we live in, often in ways the average person does not. I don\u2019t have a lot of time for personal work so I\u2019m always afraid I might see that perfect angle on a building Buffalo, or miss out on that amazing group shot in Curacao. This is what leads me to bring cameras for every situation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for someone like me to take a step back and say \u2018hey, leave the camera in the hotel room\u2019 and I think that\u2019s a hard thing for a lot of people to understand about photographers. Over the years I\u2019ve been getting better though. I\u2019ve created a list of helpful tips that I\u2019ve been using on trips lately to ensure I get to enjoy myself, the culture and the food, but still leave time for shooting.\n\nIf you liked this you can follow my collection on www.medium.com/@martinmoorejr.

Today, being a writer, artist, musician, filmmaker or photographer is not enough, and branding is just as important as the art you\u2019re creating; until you know that, you\u2019re nobody, you\u2019re just another artist.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, I\u2019m a huge fan of Medium. Since joining, I have never felt more cultured and inspired by the thousands of people who contribute their thoughts, ideas and stories. I came across one story by www.medium.com/@pacdude called \u2018In Defense Of Miley Cyrus.\u201d https://medium.com/@pacdude which blew me away because it was so true and indicative of not only what she is doing, but what I have been subconsciously trying to do as well as a photographer and artist. His article talks about how Miley Cyrus is not just some rogue drug addict degenerate. All her twerking, licking and butt naked wrecking ball riding has been meticulous, premeditated, calculated branding moves by a business women. And it works. She sells albums, she sells herself. She knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s her brand. This is something the greatest corporations like Nike, Apple and Google have been doing since their inception. It\u2019s something the greatest musicians of all time have done; The Beatles, Elvis, Madonna.\n\nBefore I got into photography I was a musician. I\u2019ve been playing music since I was a kid and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. Unfortunately, I was never able to make anything of it. It doesn\u2019t matter if I thought what I was creating was any good, or even if my friends or family thought my music was any good, nobody gave a shit, and I think I know why. Every band I was in was just \u2018another band.\u2019 My cousin is in a band called \u2018The Vitrolum Republic.\u2019 (http://www.thevitrolumrepublic.com) They aren\u2019t pop. They aren\u2019t rap. They aren\u2019t country. They classify themselves as \u2018Gypsy Noir.\u2019 I have absolutely no idea what that means and if you try to Google it you\u2019re bound to get more search results auto correcting you to Pinot Noir that any helpful information on their genre. But it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is not only is their music top notch, they have branded them selves. Everything from their clothes, to the instruments they play, to the gorgeous hand painted canvases painted by artist Sue Lawton (http://www.suelawtonart.com/blog/) that they put up behind them at every show, seeing a performance by The Vitrolum Republic is an experience. You feel transported to some early 1900's circus/tarot card-reading thing. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t describe what you\u2019re seeing and listening to, the fact is everything they are doing is making them into something bigger than what everyone else is doing. Their whole package is their brand, and it\u2019s working.\n\nKelli Anthony (http://www.kellianthony.com) is stud from Chicago, Illinois I have never met. Why? I have no idea because I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin so there is pretty much no excuse that we haven\u2019t, but he\u2019s a guy I\u2019ve been talking to and following for a while, and he\u2019s also a guy like me, who has branded himself. #swave. #catholic. #milk. His pop art and the way he brands himself is something I admire as a photographer and as an artist because he has created an identity for himself. He\u2019s not just another photographer. He\u2019s not just another artist. You can spot his work in an instant and you know what you\u2019re getting when you\u2019re getting Kelli Anthony. He is constantly pushing his brand on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Being a photographer I follow many of them, but there are few who separate themselves from the rest. As a photographer you not only want people to shoot you because you make great photo\u2019s, but you want them to shoot you because you\u2019re you. Because they want Kelli Anthony. Because they want Martin Moore. Because they want YOU. Because they want people to know that they just didn\u2019t get some person off Craigslist to do their shoot, they got that person. I\u2019ve never felt more strongly about this with photographers as I do today. I feel like there is a evolution, no, a revolution, happing with photographers today where branding is what is going to set you apart from everyone else who can get their hands on a DSLR.\n\nI don\u2019t know what people think of me as a \u2018Brand,\u2019 I guess because I\u2019ve never asked. I guess because I\u2019m a hypocrite and I don\u2019t really care. Maybe that\u2019s my brand. I know a lot of people like the work I do and time and time again choose me over a studio. Maybe it\u2019s because I like to be unconventional in the way I interact with people, you could almost say unprofessional. I like to share my life with them not badger them with FaceBook requests and weekly Senior Picture deals. I want them to know me as a person, not a company or a business.\n\nToday, being an artist is more than just the art you create. Should it be that way? Fuck no. But it is. Everyone is a musician. Everyone is a writer. Everyone is a photographer. Everyone is a filmmaker. Sometimes what you\u2019re creating isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes that one story you wrote, or that song you made that everyone loves, or that photograph you shot is a hint. A hint that there is a niche meant for you that you can exploit and grow into that you didn\u2019t even know was desired by you or anyone that wanted it. You don\u2019t have to be so accessible to be successful. You can be niche. You can create a brand for yourself. When you realize that, and embrace it, you and your art will automatically create a brand everyone will notice, then, you can grab the reins and ride the shit out of it."

        "title": "3 Ways 3D Printing Will Change Your Life \u2013 3D Printing Buzz \u2013",
        "text": "Oh, printers. You accident-prone paperweights, you. You\u2019re the one piece of technology that I can always rely on\u2026to fail me in my moment of need. Sure, mankind can sail the 7 seas, land on the moon, even create those KFC sandwiches without the buns. But God forbid you do the one thing you were designed to do: PRINT. You\u2019re the reason why Kinkos is a thing. [End rant] But as much as I hate printers, I know the 3D variety will attain the street cred the former was never able to achieve. How do I know this? Well, think about it: when was the last time a regular printer changed your life?\n\nAfter a long day of (pretending to) work, all you want is a nice, warm meal\u2014something that really hits the spot. But who has the time to cook? Yeah sure, the microwave helps. Take-out is an ok option too\u2014usually not as healthy though. What about having a meal prepared for you by the 3D printer? You input the ingredients, and the printer does the rest. It\u2019s like having a robot butler (named Charles), only not quite as cool.\n\nAnd what about clothes? As a (super masculine and charming) guy, I hate shopping. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier if you just inputted your measurements, chose a color, material, and design\u2014then let the printer work its voodoo magic? The answer is yes.\n\nEveryone wants their own version of everything. Even the same iPhone everyone owns is customized through case, ringtone, wallpaper\u2014even icon arrangement. 3D printers would allow manufacturers to easily modify orders based on the customized desires of the consumer. People would not only get what they want, but how they want it.\n\nA great example of this is the Tintin rocket (Yes, I\u2019m aware that you have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m talking about, but gimme a sec to explain). A replica of the rocket was uploaded to Thingiverse, a site dedicated to digital designs for physical objects, and was quickly removed because of copyright infringement. That didn\u2019t stop the 3D printing community though. Soon after, another user posted a similar design for a Christmas tree ornament based on the rocket. Next, someone else modified the idea so it could be illuminated, then redesigned it yet again so other users could personalize names or other text.\n\nSo if you think about it, it\u2019s not just about replicating things, it\u2019s about modifying ideas and making them even better than the last. Cool, right?\n\nRight now, we\u2019re conditioned to get software instantly\u2014most notably on our phones/tablets. We see a commercial for an app, whip out our device, and download away. Instant. The next hour is then spent ignoring the (trashy) reality show we were watching, hypnotized by the most popular app of the week.\n\nBut what if instead of a software app, you could download software instructions? Think about it. You\u2019re sitting there, watching the latest Shahs of Sunset, thinking to yourself, \u201cwhy am I watching Shahs of Sunset?\u201d and BAM\u2014you see a commercial for the coolest, most awesome thing in the world: a thingamabob. You grab your phone/tablet, hop onto some sort of store\u2014akin to an app store, and download your latest fascination. But now, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Simply send the software to your 3D printer, and in no time, you have your very own thingamabob\u2014right in front of you to play with. Yes, that is something to high-five about.\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, the increased availability of instant hardware gratification will push supply chains to be faster and more efficient to adapt to consumer needs and expectations. In other words, for the things you can\u2019t 3D print, companies will have to up their game, realizing that consumers will have a shorter tolerance for wait time."

        "text": "Think you have what it takes to be an A-10 Warthog pilot? Then get ready to break out the crayons and colored pencils.\n\nBack in the 1980s, the A-10 was one of the Pentagon\u2019s deadliest tank-killers. The twin-engine A-10 was a veritable flying tank itself, heavily armored and hauling AGM-65 Maverick missiles and a GAU-8/A 30-millimeter Gatling cannon.\n\nWhen it fires, it sounds like a buzzsaw.\n\nTo help them hit their targets, Hog pilots also had their own coloring book. The A-10 Pilots Coloring Book, with the Strangelovian subtitle What You Always Wanted to Know About the T-62 But Were Afraid to Ask, was a tongue-in-cheek and politically incorrect guide on how to destroy Soviet vehicles.\n\nFor areas the A-10\u2019s cannon can penetrate, you should color it green. Red is for areas you can\u2019t penetrate at a given angle of attack. And black is for areas that are \u201cungood, you must learn to hate these areas,\u201d the book states.\n\nAnother page shows the underbelly of a T-62 tank, easily penetrated by the A-10\u2019s cannon. \u201cUnfortunately, if you see it from this angle you have just been run over by subject tank,\u201d the book deadpans.\n\n\u201cColor the bottom of the tank green and yourself brown\u2014you dumb shit an A-10 will not fit underneath a T-62 tank and remain airborne.\u201d\n\nSaucy language aside (\u201cHate that Commie tank,\u201d reads one page), the illustrations have a real educational purpose behind them.\n\n\u201cThe point of the article is to highlight for newly assigned pilots the improved vulnerabilities of the tank from a side or rear attack,\u201d Andy Bush, a retired A-10 pilot, tells War is Boring.\n\nBush flew A-10s from 1982 to 1988, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. He acquired a copy of the coloring book while based at RAF Bentwaters in England.\n\n\u201cNo idea who wrote it or where,\u201d he says. He shared the illustrations with the aviation geeks at SimHQ more than a decade ago, and they\u2019ve circulated around military forums ever since.\n\nWe\u2019ve done our best to host the images ihere, and a .zip file containing the full high-resolution set is available at Imgur.\n\nAmong the lessons: The A-10\u2019s main gun is ineffective during a frontal attack on a tank. \u201cIf you even think of attacking it this way color yourself very very stupid and ineffective,\u201d the book underlines.\n\nOn the other hand, a hit on the T-62\u2019s barrel should \u201cdestroy its effectiveness,\u201d though that\u2019s not exactly an easy shot.\n\nAt slant ranges in excess of 7,000 feet, an A-10 can penetrate the crew compartment by aiming at the lower sides near the treads. The turret is a no-go, but the upper side of the hull is vulnerable.\n\nAnother image has inked-in stick figures representing the crew. \u201cStrafe those atheistic degenerates,\u201d the book spits.\n\nThe best place to aim? The rear. \u201cColor it vulnerable green.\u201d\n\nBut according to Bush, gun kills on Soviet tanks were likely to be rare even when aiming for the rear.\n\n\u201cDepending on terrain and enemy defenses, these attacks were possible but were far more dangerous than a frontal attack at long range,\u201d he says. \u201cAnother consideration is that the T-62 is an older tank, more along the line of Vietnam War era. In the \u201980s, we were faced with more modern tanks such as the T-72, with even better armor capability.\u201d\n\nFor these tanks\u2014and especially when defended by Soviet anti-air defenses\u2014the A-10 pilots trained to rely on their Maverick precision-guided missiles.\n\n\u201cThe A-10 gun is more like shooting a shotgun than a rifle,\u201d Bush says. \u201cWe fired into an area\u2014the tank itself\u2014rather than a specific spot. This is particularly true of attacks from longer ranges\u20144,000 feet or more. The hope was that the large number of rounds would result in some hits in the desired area.\u201d\n\nIf Bush had been tasked with flying his A-10 toward invading Soviet armies in a hypothetical World War III, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d be alive today. The Air Force once estimated America\u2019s entire Warthog force would be effectively destroyed within two weeks of a conventional European war with Moscow.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t attest to those numbers,\u201d Bush says. \u201cI suppose in a worst case scenario, they are close to the mark.\u201d\n\nBut the A-10 pilots would have done everything they could to avoid a direct fight.\n\n\u201cWe used formation tactics that included deception, avoidance of enemy radar and multiple simultaneous attacks to improve our chances,\u201d Bush adds. \u201cHow well would this have worked? Who knows. I never was too rosy about our chances if the Rooskies ever came across the border in full force.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Bush cautions not to misrepresent the A-10 as NATO\u2019s primary tank killer, something which military writers are wont to do. It wasn\u2019t. That job was for NATO\u2019s tanks and attack helicopters.\n\n\u201cWe were there as an additional force that could response quicker to enemy breakthroughs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe supplemented the Army guys, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force plans to eventually retire the A-10 fleet to make way for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Pentagon and Air Force argue the Warthog is too old, slow and vulnerable to be of much use in a modern battlefield\u2014although it\u2019s carried out brutally effective close-air support in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt cannot survive or operate effectively where there are more advanced aircraft or air defenses,\u201d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in February in 2014."

        "title": "How Hollywood Should Monetize Popcorn Time \u2013 Jordan Francis \u2013",
        "text": "Since its release in early March, Popcorn Time has turned heads in both the online piracy community and the media industry. The open source software takes the notoriously finicky protocol BitTorrent, a high speed peer-to-peer method for sharing data, and makes it consumer friendly. Users simply need to download Popcorn Time to their computer and select a video. The chosen movie or television program then streams instantly, mimicking Netflix, but serving an infinitely larger, illegal obtained content library.\n\nNaturally, Hollywood is not happy. The original creators of the site announced their retirement from development in mid-March, but have since posted the source code online, generating a multi-headed hydra of replacements. Still, nearly every offshoot (or \u201cfork\u201d in open source dev terms) has subsequently shuttered under mysterious circumstances. Online speculation points the finger at copyright holders, a suspicion yet to be confirmed.\n\nIronically, Popcorn Time\u2019s devs have provided Hollywood with a potentially industry changing distribution model \u2014 all for free. Large video files are difficult to move around the internet, in turn stemming video piracy (especially in comparison to music). If studios can leverage Popcorn Time\u2019s vision quickly and efficiently, they stand a chance of surviving the future onslaught of piracy, which will only increase as the average consumer gains access to ever-faster internet connections.\n\nThere is nothing inherently illegal about BitTorrent. It\u2019s just way of downloading data. Typically, when a user downloads a file, the information comes from a single source. For example, while streaming a Netflix video, the video is sent from Netflix\u2019s servers to a user\u2019s computer. In contrast, BitTorrent leverages power in numbers \u2014 at a given time, every user downloading a file shares bits and pieces of the file with one another, in turn speeding up the download immensely. Furthermore, those who have already downloaded the file can choose to stay online and \u201cseed\u201d, or continue to help others download.\n\nThe decentralized nature of BitTorrent lends itself to piracy, but BitTorrent has proven a capable driver of legal technology as well. BitTorrent Inc., the company that invented the namesake protocol, has leveraged the BitTorrent to help Facebook push updates to its website and everyday consumers move their personal files around the web.\n\nBitTorrent Inc., has even helped creatives get their work in the hands of consumers through their \u201cbundles\u201d program. Past bundles have included an Oscar nominated film, best selling book and Grammy nominated album in 2013 alone. These bundles offer a limited amount of content for free, and typically require some sort of user input to unlock the entire download ( usually an email address to be used in future marketing efforts).\n\nHowever, BitTorrent\u2019s single greatest barrier to widespread adoption is ease of use. A potential user must first download specialized software and search the open web for torrent files. Then, the torrent file must be downloaded and fed into the specialized software, which downloads the actual piece of content. Clearly, this entire paradigm has room for improvement.\n\nPopcorn Time is not technologically revolutionary. The product is a mashup of two common products \u2014 a search engine and a BitTorrent client \u2014 but the result is greater than the sum of its parts. Popcorn Time takes the multistep process of downloading and watching a torrent and simplifies it to the bare minimum. In fact, the experience closely imitates existing sources of video on demand (VOD), but entirely for free and with a theoretically endless library.\n\nEven considering it\u2019s success, Popcorn Time is far from perfect. The program\u2019s biggest weakness actually lies in it\u2019s total reliance on BitTorrent. Because BitTorrent utilizes those downloading the same file, any niche file does not download at high speeds. While popular releases such as The Avengers stream on command, catalogue movies take a frustratingly long time to buffer. Among young consumers, these films are not very important, but for an older audience ( e.g. those with disposable income), time tested content is essential.\n\nPopcorn Time has proven proof of concept. For the correct value proposition, users are willing to download specialized software to watch film and television. Nonetheless, no one is paying for the content \u2014 yet. I believe that a legal Popcorn Time app could generate revenue with some creative thinking and a disregard for convention:\n\nThis may sound simple, but charging for BitTorrent has not been tried, even though it is technically possible. BitTorrent Inc plans on adding \u201cpay gates\u201d to bundles in the future, and the program has already proven that partially \u201clocked\u201d torrent files can be popular with consumers.\n\nBitTorrent is inherently participatory. By downloading a file, a user helps those in the community also download a file as well. I propose that a legal Popcorn Time compensate seeders with credit for future purchases. In this model, distributors can save money on web hosting costs and server upkeep by allowing their users to help disseminate content. However, content providers should compliment peer-to-peer distribution with centralized servers in order to insure that catalogue content can always be served. This hybrid approach has been successful in the past \u2014 while growing, Spotify used peer-to-peer tech in conjunction with traditional streaming in order to compensate for their nascent server capacity.\n\nVirility is central to BitTorrent. As seeders increase, download speeds increase exponentially. I want to extend this thinking to the marketing itself, by compensating users for acts of social engagement. The new Popcorn Time would award credit for small grassroots efforts, including tweets, volunteered email address, and Facebook shares, but here, I would warning against anything not genuine. The goal is for users to champion content they enjoy by helping distribute and marketing it, not spamming social networks with cookie-cutter messages. Thus, I suggested that rewards be priced algorithmically, adjusting for quality content as measured through retweets and likes.\n\nI doubt that mainstream Hollywood would voluntarily make such drastic changes to online distribution, but I believe the strategy outlined above could help indies leverage online communities to help spread work today. Small films with niche audiences could have their film seen without ceding control to YouTube or paying for a Vimeo Pro account.\n\nAs technology changes, business models must change as well. Thus far, Hollywood has yet to react to the death of the DVD and the growth of digital in a clear, coherent matter. It remains to be seen whether they will do so on their own terms or continue watch upstarts like Popcorn Time disrupt the status quo."

        "title": "Passwords are Obsolete \u2013 Justin Balthrop \u2013",
        "text": "I have 268 passwords on 268 different websites. At least that\u2019s what my password manager says. I actually stopped saving new passwords a while back, so the real number of passwords I should change now that Heartbleed has been revealed is even higher than that. How many of those passwords do you think I\u2019m going to change? It took me 10 minutes just to find the change password form for my bank! What about the average computer user who uses the same password for every website and doesn\u2019t understand the details of the exploit? How many passwords will they change?\n\nNot very many.\n\nEverybody knows that most passwords will remain unchanged. Yet our collective response to Heartbleed has been to patch our servers and email users asking them to do something we know most of them won\u2019t do.\n\nHere\u2019s what our response should have been:\n\nIt turns out that passwords are obsolete, and they have been for a long time. Like the occasional pay phone you find in the back of a run-down restaurant, passwords have been unnecessary for years. The difference is that everyone laughs and reminisces when they see a pay phone, but nobody does that when they see a password field. But they should.\n\nThere are two separate technologies that have made passwords obsolete, and they aren\u2019t the ones you would think. You may have guessed fingerprint scanners. Or voice recognition. Or maybe iris scanners. Nope. The technologies that made passwords obsolete have nothing to do with biometrics. And they have been mainstream for much longer.\n\nPasswords are obsolete because of email and SMS. Specifically, the ability to send an email or SMS to users reliably and quickly. In theory, we\u2019ve had that ability for a long time. And with the rise of services like Twilio for SMS and Mandrill for emails, it\u2019s incredibly easy.\n\nThe basic idea is that instead of using a password to authenticate each user, a temporary secret code is sent to them over a secure channel. Email or SMS is that (mostly) secure channel. It\u2019s almost as if the backend server makes up a temporary, one-use password each time a user wants to log in and whispers it in their ear.\n\nThe interesting thing is that we already use exactly this flow for password reset emails. This is why I previously recommended taking advantage of this so you could stop remembering your passwords.\n\nMy argument was mostly from the perspective of convenience though. I assume you\u2019re using a different password for every website. There\u2019s no way you will remember all of those passwords, and it is pretty inconvenient to have to put every single one of them into a password manager. Especially on a mobile device. So instead, you make up random passwords, immediately forget them, and use the password reset flow next time you need to log in.\n\nBut the recent Heartbleed bug highlights the fact that hacking password reset flows for convenience is not good enough. We need to convince websites to stop using passwords altogether."

Yes, I was suffering from our generation\u2019s new sleeping problem.\n\nIt is caused by too much blue light, especially when you stare at your cell phone before sleeping, which leaves you awake after only a few hours of sleep. I thought it was useless to try sleeping any further, so I decided to get up and start working.\n\nAfter checking my emails, I found myself on Twitter. One of the tweets took me to an article about Ruby on Rails on TechCrunch. That article took me to Codeacademy, where I discovered you can actually learn how to code.\n\nThen I was disrupted by a call from a friend of mine. During the call, I realized that day was actually the birthday of a friend of mine so I got on Facebook where the top post on my newsfeed was about a new social network.\n\nI went to check what it was about and holy sh*t, that SoundCloud the article was talking about was actually such a cool thing. I spent another two hours on it.\n\nGuess what? I even came up with a new startup idea that could be much better than SoundCloud! Soon, my mind was exploding with amazing ideas and I was exhausted.\n\nOh wait, I just saw another tweet.

        "text": "Oceans aren\u2019t endless. But from our perspective, they may as well be. The Internet is sort of the same thing. Not really endless, just seemingly so. Digital images are kinda the same as that, with even more possible outcomes. That six megapixel camera you got in 2003 has more possibilities than there are molecules in the entire planet. But it is in fact a finite system.\n\nSo why do we care so much about how we build the web? Why do we put so much decisiveness and thought into our own websites, our blogs, our Facebook pages? Why is it \u201cbad\u201d if our institutional websites have ads, or links to \u201cexternal websites.\u201d What does that even mean?\n\nFor the last week or so I\u2019ve been at the Museums & the Web conference in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a fantastic conference, full of inspiration, and great thinkers.\n\nEach year, there are two major conferences for the museum-tech world. This one, Museum\u2019s & the Web (MW) is slightly larger than its doppelg\u00e4nger, Museum Computer Network (MCN), which usually takes place six moths apart from the former.\n\nI\u2019ve been to the last two MCNs, and this was my first MW. To me, at this point, they are essentially the same, but I\u2019m still sort of a n00b.\n\nAt all three conferences I\u2019ve given some sort of a presentation. The first, a joint talk about what we at the Cooper-Hewitt Labs call Parallel-TMS with my colleague, Aaron Cope. The second, at MCN in Montreal, a solo show about Rapid Prototyping in Museums. This year I tried to shed light on why Cooper-Hewitt ( where I work ) is switching from Drupal as its CMS to Wordpress\u2014something I can sum up in this single slide from my talk.\n\nOne aspect of the conference that has permeated along with each iteration is the things companies like Google have been doing with regard to museums, and now \u201ccultural institutions\u201d and as well, anyone who makes art.\n\nThe Google Art Project has evolved greatly in the last two years from a giant repository of concordified art museums, to something even more\u2014offering anyone with some kind of a collection the opportunity to build amazing websites.\n\nOf course it raises serious questions. Of course it is disruptive in a sector that is typically conservative when it comes to publishing on the web. But, it is also of course, an opportunity. Everyone wants a piece of the Google pie. The conference halls are filled with everyone who can fit when Google demos their new offerings. What can we all get from Google that will be a big win for museums? Is it still too scary? Where\u2019s the payoff? How will this increase traffic to our blog?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to really understand all the issues. It\u2019s difficult for me to empathize with everyone in the room\u2014something I\u2019ve been trying to do better at ever since joining the museum world nearly four years ago.\n\nI had a similar reaction when sitting in on a \u201cweb crit\u201d when it came time to talk about Artsy.net. The main source of confusion everyone seemed to have was over Artsy\u2019s mission. Is Artsy a place for the wealthy to buy and sell fine art? Are they a place for non-profits like museums to showcase and connect works with other institutions ( like the way Google Art Project does ) or are they an editorial platform for making beautiful web pages about art?\n\nThese three offerings seem to me to be conflicting with one another. As museums, we need to be clear about how our brand might intermingle with a company like Artsy. How would a teenager respond to finding an interesting article about this important chair on Artsy? Might they assume the museum is trying to sell it?\n\nI can see how partnerships like these can put museums in a difficult position. It\u2019s a hard choice to make. The credibility that Artsy and Google gain by partnering with the likes of the Smithsonian or the Met is really great, and it\u2019s still a little unclear what the institutions get in return.\n\nBut from my perspective, the issue at hand is always the visitor. Partnering will mean we may be able to reach audiences we normally would have missed. It could mean a better experience for our visitors so long as those products continue to grow and allow for better serendipitous discovery without compromising the integrity of the institutions\u2014too much."

Ellie sucked on a pacifier coated in sugar water, but her blue eyes remained wide open as the tech inserted tiny earbuds into her ears and played her a prolonged tone. The cochlea should echo the tone back into the earbuds, but the machine registered nothing. Many newborns don\u2019t pass the screening, the tech told Ellie\u2019s parents, Christine and Derek. Sometimes a baby\u2019s cries interfere with the test, sometimes fluid in the ears is the problem. By the time Ellie\u2019s audiologist appointment rolled around three weeks later, Derek was back at work as a foreman. Christine told him not to bother taking time off. She wasn\u2019t worried. To make sure Ellie slept, she didn\u2019t breastfeed until the appointment. Ellie\u2019s howls of hunger reverberated off the walls as Christine rushed around the Braintree Rehabilitation Center in suburban Boston in search of the right office. Once there, Ellie nursed and promptly fell asleep, while nurses tested her inner ear and monitored her brain activity. After the two-hour-plus exam, the audiologist left the room. When she returned, she was carrying a three-inch-thick packet of papers and fliers. \u201cYour daughter has profound hearing loss,\u201d she told Christine. Normal conversations register in the 60-decibel range, but the tests revealed that Ellie could hear nothing below 120 decibels. Through her ears, a gunshot would be no more than a whisper. \u201cThe only thing I could think of was that I would never be able to take my daughter to an Air Supply concert,\u201d Christine tells me, leaning into a recliner in her living room in Braintree. \u201cOh my god\u2014I have the worst taste in music.\u201d A 37-year-old New York native and a self-described \u201cwicked type A,\u201d Christine talks fast and laughs a lot. She inherited her love of the Australian soft-rock duo from her mother. When she was four months pregnant with Ellie, she made a bright yellow poster for her daughter and had the band members sign it. It read, \u201cThird Generation Air Supply Fan On Board.\u201d\n\nParenting is full of big decisions. But in the first year or so of Ellie\u2019s life, when other parents are focused on helping their kids to walk and talk, Christine and Derek had to think about an issue that many parents never even contemplate: They had to decide which culture their daughter should be a part of. Ellie could join their world, the hearing world, if she received cochlear implants. Yet implants don\u2019t work perfectly. Everyday conversation can remain a challenge, for instance, especially when there\u2019s a lot of background noise. What\u2019s more, implants might cut Ellie off from a community that, some would argue, is her birthright: the Deaf world, where lack of hearing is an identity to be celebrated, not a disability to be cured. As Derek puts it: \u201cHow do you explain that she was fine the way she was born when the first thing we did was change her?\u201d In fact, the Reids\u2019 decision is bigger than that, bigger perhaps than they feel comfortable acknowledging. Very few hearing people are aware of the vibrancy and depth of Deaf culture. It\u2019s a world with its own etiquette and norms. It has languages\u2014the many different forms of sign\u2014as rich and nuanced as any spoken tongue. Like any culture, it has its own interpretation of history. There are Deaf theater companies and Deaf film festivals and Deaf comedy shows. And these are not facsimiles of hearing-world versions, with speech replaced by sign. The shared experience of deafness, and the physical nature of sign, make Deaf arts distinct in a way that most hearing people cannot appreciate. More than 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, so this culture is not inherited\u2014it is discovered, via mentors and peers. And by helping deaf children to hear, implants make that discovery less likely. So for many Deaf people, every implanted child is a person stolen from their culture. Some call the process cultural genocide. That\u2019s why the Reids\u2019 decision was so profound. Just by doing what parents do\u2014loving their child and fighting for what\u2019s best for her\u2014they had to decide whether to contribute to what might be the death of a culture.\n\nAfter passing through the outer and middle ear, sound waves enter a fluid-filled, spiral-shaped chamber. This is the cochlea. Thirty thousand tiny hair cells line a membrane that runs through the center of the chamber\u2014miniature machines that convert sound into electrical signals, which then travel along the auditory nerve and into the brain. For the vast majority of deaf and hard-of-hearing people, these hair cells are damaged or missing. For children born profoundly deaf, or who lose hearing before they can talk, the prospects of effective speech are virtually nonexistent. Lip-reading, too, is daunting: If you have never heard, you have no mental sound to link with lip movements. Even if that link could be made, around a third of spoken English is indistinguishable on the mouth and lips. (Look in a mirror and try to tell the difference between words like \u201cpat\u201d and \u201cbat,\u201d or \u201cto\u201d and \u201cdo.\u201d) Sign languages lack a written form, so much of deaf history has been lost to time. When the history was recorded, the voices of the deaf were rarely included; mostly the accounts come from philosophers, poets, and artists who have interacted with deaf people and, as one Deaf studies expert put it, mused about \u201cthis alternative way of being and thinking in the world.\u201d Aristotle believed that \u201chearing is the sense of sound, and sound the vehicle of thought; hence the blind are more intelligent than deaf-mutes.\u201d References to the deaf in the Old Testament suggest a sympathy towards the non-hearing, but the same cannot be said for early Christians. Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans reads: \u201cFaith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\u201d A deaf person, under such a view, could not have faith. It\u2019s not until the 18th century, and the advent of schools for the deaf, that deaf voices become more widely heard. The most famous of these early schools was started in France by Charles-Michel de l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e, a hearing abbot who chanced upon deaf sisters and learned enough rudimentary sign language to communicate with them. The deaf have come to revere the abbott, and up until recently recounted his tale in epic terms. Carol Padden, a linguist at the University of California San Diego, recounts one version she heard: \u201cThe Abb\u00e9 de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e had been walking for a long time through a dark night. He wanted to stop and rest overnight, but he couldn\u2019t not find a place to stay, until at a distance he saw a house with a light.\u201d De l\u2019Ep\u00e9e found a house with two young women, who did not speak. Only after their mother appeared and told de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e that they were deaf did he understand. His life\u2019s purpose\u2014to help deaf people\u2014became clear. \u201cThe story of the Abb\u00e9 de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e is almost always a preface to an official deaf-club event,\u201d Padden writes. The story might be apocryphal, but reverence for de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e is well placed because the Parisian school he started catalysed deaf education. In 1817, Laurent Clerc, one of the school\u2019s most prominent students, and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a hearing American scholar with an interest in the deaf, founded what became the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. It would become the birthplace of modern-day American Sign Language. Deaf schools later proliferated, each with its own quirks, customs, and dialects. Much as hearing people say where they\u2019re from when meeting a new person, Deaf individuals began including where they went to school. Yet acceptance of sign was far from widespread. Educators at the Clarke Schools for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, banned sign and attempted to teach students to speak. They took their cue from Alexander Graham Bell, the man famous for inventing the telephone and infamous, at least in the Deaf community, for his abhorrence of sign. Bell believed that sign prevented deaf people from integrating into society, an opinion drawn from personal experience: his wife was deaf and his mother lost her hearing when he was a child. If deaf children found it hard to communicate with one another, went Bell\u2019s thinking, they\u2019d be less likely to pair up, and less likely to produce more deaf children. The most important battle in the war between the two approaches\u2014oralist and signing\u2014was fought in 1880, when deaf educators from across the globe convened in Milan, Italy, for the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf. There was only a single deaf delegate, and most fell squarely in the oralist camp. Attendees agreed upon \u201cthe incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring deaf-mutes to social life\u201d and voted to use the oral method. Today, Deaf people see the conference as the bleakest moment in their history, an event that closed deaf schools around the world and drove sign languages underground. The Dark Age of deafness didn\u2019t wane until the 1970s, when William Stokoe, a teacher at Gallaudet, debunked the notion that ASL was nothing more than pidgin English. Others would later show that ASL was distinct from spoken English, and contained its own grammar and syntax. People started talking of Deaf culture, the D capitalized to distinguish the culture from the condition. And that culture began, slowly, to diffuse into the hearing world. The touring National Theatre of the Deaf took its shows on the road to help de-stigmatize sign. The deaf actress Linda Bove got her start there, before going to Sesame Street, where she introduced two generations of children to sign language and the idea that being deaf was something to celebrate. For many adults, the introduction came from the 1986 movie Children of a Lesser God, in which deaf actress Marlee Matlin plays a former Deaf-school student working as a custodian at her alma mater. She falls for a hearing speech teacher, played by William Hurt, who tries unsuccessfully to get her to speak instead of sign. Eventually, Hurt is forced to accept Matlin for what she is: a beautiful and proud Deaf woman. The movie earned Matlin the Best Actress Oscar and made millions aware of the Deaf cause. \u201cThe subject matter is new and challenging, and I was interested in everything the movie had to tell me about deafness,\u201d wrote critic Roger Ebert. (Sensitivities still ran high. Many Deaf people excoriated Matlin, who has some residual hearing, for speaking when she returned to the Oscars to present an award). The irony of this period is that it contains not just the flowering of the Deaf civil rights movement, which was based on the idea that deaf people didn\u2019t need a cure, but also the emergence of something approximating just that\u2014a cure. In 1984, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved cochlear implants. The devices come in two parts. A hearing-aid shaped computer, worn on the ear, digitizes incoming sound. That sound is then sent, by radio, to electrodes implanted in the cochlea, which activate the auditory nerve. At first, the FDA approved implants for adults only. But some argued that if children received implants just before they would normally begin speaking, the hearing parts of their brains might develop along the same trajectory as other children. They might learn to hear and speak. To be clear: Cochlear implants don\u2019t fix the biology of the ear. They\u2019re a prosthesis, a workaround. People with implants cannot hear like non-deaf people. Users typically remove the processor to sleep and shower, and the batteries need to be replaced. When the processors are out or the batteries have run down, users are once again deaf.\n\nIn the weeks after Ellie\u2019s diagnosis, Christine scoured the Internet, learning about deafness and looking for schools, eventually stumbling across the Learning Center for the Deaf, a school in nearby Framingham. Its philosophy is that deaf children should learn sign as their mother tongue, and reading and writing English as a second language. As with many in the deaf world, the Learning Center doesn\u2019t see speaking as fundamental. The Reids were smitten. \u201cNobody was like, \u2018Oh your baby is deaf. I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019\u201d Christine says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t there to fix my kid.\u201d With sign, Ellie would have an entr\u00e9e into Deaf culture. Deaf people often love sign\u2014its cadence, its use of facial expressions, its reliance on three-dimensional space\u2014in a way that hearing people struggle to comprehend. Some discover sign later in life, and find that it can kindle a sort of a spiritual awakening. Ash Arp, a deaf woman in Arizona who was raised orally and received implants as a young adult, didn\u2019t learn to sign until she was 17. In her blog, she writes: \u201cBefore I learned ASL and was a part of the Deaf community, it felt as if I were living in an old foreign film, where nothing was clear, where the world around me was muffled, where I was alone, without friends, without true understanding. I was able to grasp a word here and there, I was able to understand some simple things, but never with fluency, never with the ability to really grasp it. When I learned ASL and became a part of my Deaf community, my world suddenly had color, had vibrancy, had understanding, free flowing comprehension, exchanges of ideas, flow.\u201d The Reids enrolled Ellie at the Learning Center and felt empowered. Surrounded by deaf children and deaf educators, Ellie\u2019s so-called disability disappeared. They began to wonder if cochlear implants were really worth exploring. Why not embrace Ellie\u2019s deaf identity instead? Yet the Reids also learned that they faced a series of painful trade-offs. Embracing Ellie\u2019s deaf identity, for instance, could mean distancing themselves from her, because few hearing people who learn sign as adults become fluent. Barbara Herrmann, an audiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, tells the families she works with that adults who learn a second language typically reach intermediate level. Because of this, parents who give their child access to Deaf culture take a tremendous risk: If their own signing doesn\u2019t improve, they won\u2019t be able to speak the language their child feels most comfortable in. Without implants, Ellie would also have to learn to read and write in a language\u2014English\u2014that she had never heard. She wouldn\u2019t be able to learn by using rhyming games or sounding words out. What\u2019s more, the structure of sign language sentences is nothing like that of written and spoken English. Because of this, Christine and Derek feared that no school could give Ellie the skills she would need to compete. The data back them up: The average deaf adult reads at the level of a nine-year-old, and has math skills that are only a couple of years more advanced. Christine also heard the stories about deaf adults who, regardless of skills and intelligence, struggled to find jobs in the hearing world. \u201cI realized that it doesn\u2019t matter how smart my kid is or how good she is at her job,\u201d Christine says. \u201cShe\u2019s always going to be at the mercy of somebody else.\u201d In fact, the Reids were unusual in the weight they gave Deaf culture when considering implants. When Ellie was 10 months old, the Reids joined a support group at the Learning Center made up of hearing and deaf parents. All the hearing parents had gone ahead with implants for their children, and all the deaf parents had decided not to. \u201cThe Deaf people stayed together and the hearing people [stayed together],\u201d Christine says. \u201cDerek and I were in the middle.\u201d Christine asked the center to connect her with hearing parents of deaf children who had foregone implants. The school couldn\u2019t find anyone.\n\nFor those in the Deaf world, many of whom were born with hearing loss, the very existence of cochlear implants wrongly presupposes that a deaf person is in need of fixing. In 1993, when the technology was in its infancy, journalist Edward Dolnick explained the Deaf cause to the hearing world in an article in the Atlantic Monthly titled \u201cDeafness as Culture.\u201d Dolnick quoted Deaf Life magazine: \u201cAn implant is the ultimate invasion of the ear, the ultimate denial of deafness, the ultimate refusal to let deaf children be Deaf.\u201d In this view, the Reids, should they implant Ellie, would be perpetrating a horrific crime. Discrimination against the deaf is termed \u201caudism.\u201d When I ask members of the advocacy group Audism Free America how they feel about a \u201ccure\u201d for deafness, they equate it to a cure for being black or female or gay. I counter that the analogy might be a stretch, since deafness is the absence of a key sense. Karen Christie, one of the group\u2019s founders, rejects the notion. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t absent of whiteness,\u201d she writes to me over Skype. \u201cI am a woman but I am not absent of a penis.\u201d A generation of children with implants has come of age since Dolnick\u2019s article appeared. At least half of those eligible for implants now choose to receive them and, at least in the United States, better screening for newborns means that hearing loss can be diagnosed at a few weeks or months, allowing children to receive implants much earlier. In places like the Netherlands and Denmark, where the cost of implants for children is covered by the state, the proportion of recipients is close to 100 percent. (Most major insurance companies in the US cover at least some of the costs of implants.) And while reliable statistics are scarce, experts say that even culturally Deaf adults\u2014the same people who might have taken a rejectionist stance 20 years ago\u2014have been getting implants for their deaf children and occasionally themselves. These \u201cmixed\u201d families often prefer to stay out of the limelight. Several months ago, I asked Jonathan O\u2019Dell, a training specialist with the Massachusetts Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, to put me in touch with Deaf parents who had gotten implants for their children. He reached out to several families, but nobody came forward. \u201cYou may know there is some degree of discomfort in the deaf community about cochlear implants, and I\u2019m sure that had a lot to do with it,\u201d O\u2019Dell wrote me in an email. This reluctance to talk has led many in the Deaf community to mistakenly believe that no loving Deaf parents would implant their own baby, which they see as a form of abuse\u2014akin to making a gay child straight through surgery. As a result, individuals within close-knit Deaf communities rarely encounter these \u201ctraitorous\u201d Deaf parents, let alone debate with them. This discord stem from deafness\u2019s dual\u2014and dueling\u2014status as both a disability and an ethnicity, says Trevor Johnston, an expert in sign language linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Johnston is hearing, but grew up with deaf parents and many deaf relatives. \u201cThe loss of some deaf communities and their signed languages would be an unambiguous cultural and linguistic tragedy,\u201d he wrote in a 2005 essay. Yet after weighing that tragedy against the nature of deafness, he reached a conclusion that most people outside of Deaf culture would probably agree with: \u201cI, for one, could not try to guarantee the continuation of a culture and a language that are ultimately based on a disability.\u201d\n\nOne cold Saturday night this past December, I visit the bookstore Before Your Quiet Eyes, which is tucked away in a gritty part of Rochester, New York. Around 20 people have gathered to watch Vicki Nordquist, a Deaf woman with broad shoulders and cropped brown hair. Nordquist begins her performance by signing \u201cCan you all hear OK?\u201d It\u2019s a joke, of course, and I chuckle along with the others when an interpreter translates. Nordquist rests her notes on a table in front of her and opens with a skit. \u201cEach letter has its own personality. Did you know that?\u201d She signs the letter A, a forward-facing fist, with her right hand, and then taps on it with her left hand as if to say, \u201cmove along now.\u201d With her left hand, she signs the letter B, an open palm with the thumb folded over. B gives way to C, a cupped palm, and so on. Nordquist tells me afterwards that this sort of performance, where a single letter or word is animated with a voice and personality, is \u201ca kind of poetry, like a haiku.\u201d Nordquist\u2019s performance lasts for an hour or so and elicits hearty laughs, but much of the humor is lost in translation. I giggle along nervously. At one point, Nordquist calls on another hearing person\u2014a friend I brought along\u2014to read The Night Before Christmas while she signs. The two have trouble synching. Nordquist can\u2019t hear and my friend can only sign the alphabet and a smattering of words. \u201cNow you turn the page,\u201d Nordquist directs her periodically. After my friend concludes with, \u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night,\u201d it takes a moment for Nordquist to catch up, lending the impression that they\u2019ve performed the story in rounds. Watching Nordquist I\u2019m reminded of a time, years ago, when I was living in Japan. While I was there I attended a Kabuki performance, a traditional form of Japanese theater where actors tell a story through subtle, highly stylized movements. I found the performance entirely inscrutable, while my companion, an elderly Japanese man, watched with rapt attention. After Nordquist\u2019s performance, I chat with Laurie Monahan, a middle-aged woman clad in a purple tie and plaid vest. When Monahan was growing up in the 1960s and \u201970s, her parents were told not to learn sign. She was thrust into hearing schools, where she understood nothing. \u201cI was so isolated. I was abused and beat up by other students,\u201d she tells me through my interpreter. \u201cIt was horrid. My childhood was terrible. I didn\u2019t know who I was. I couldn\u2019t communicate with my family. I couldn\u2019t communicate with other kids.\u201d When her parents finally sent her to a deaf school, she says, \u201cI found that there were other people like me. I fell in love with ASL.\u201d Recently, Monahan\u2019s mother asked her if she would consider cochlear implants. Monahan was offended. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she told her. \u201cI\u2019m finally happy.\u201d\n\nAmid the swirl of trade-offs that the Reids faced, they kept coming back to their fear of leaving Ellie disadvantaged\u2014at the mercy of others, as Christine put it. It was this that led them to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston one afternoon in September 2012. Christine was a wreck. \u201cI remember our first appointment\u2014I couldn\u2019t figure out how the fuck to get to the hospital,\u201d she says. She drove around in circles sobbing the whole time. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Derek, this is not meant to be. We should not do this.\u201d\u2019 But when the Reids finally met with the surgeon and talked over their fears\u2014especially the small chance that Ellie would be left with facial paralysis\u2014they felt reassured enough to schedule the surgery. In February of last year, Ellie received implants in both ears. \u201cI would rather Ellie be mad at us because we went ahead and did this without her permission, than for her to be mad at us because we never gave her the chance,\u201d says Derek. Soon after Ellie\u2019s implants had been turned on, Christine was carrying her daughter on her hip outside the family\u2019s home, a condominium that sits right next to Boston\u2019s red T train line. On that spring day, as a train barreled past, Ellie whipped her head around and pointed in surprise. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Christine recalls thinking. \u201cThe surgery worked.\u201d By the time I visit the Reids one Friday morning this past September, Ellie is just over two years old and has had her implants for five months. She\u2019s developed a fondness for the letter \u201cm.\u201d \u201cMilk,\u201d she says. \u201cMore.\u201d She likes walking up and down the short hallway leading to the bedrooms muttering, \u201cmarch, march, march.\u201d When I arrive, Ellie is watching Fraggle Rock in her pajamas, an indulgence Christine allows so that she can \u201cpractice hearing.\u201d When the Fraggles exit the screen and the narrator comes on, Ellie gets her mother\u2019s attention by grunting. Christine signs back \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d by hooking together the pinky and thumb on her right hand and tapping her chin. She furrows her brow to indicate that she\u2019s asking a question. Ellie signs back, \u201cMore Fraggle Rock,\u201d using the Reids\u2019 homemade sign for the show: the sign for rock (a right fist knocking on the left fist), but with her right fist finger-spelling the letter \u201cF\u201d. The Fraggles return, but it isn\u2019t long before Ellie removes her processors, an indication that she\u2019s done hearing. Prevailing wisdom says that children should use the implants during all waking hours, but Ellie gets to choose. Her audiologist doesn\u2019t push the issue; she knows that the Reids\u2019 goals for their daughter are atypical of most hearing parents, who yearn for their children to hear and speak above all else. \u201cIf she can learn to hear and speak then that\u2019s great,\u201d Christine explains. \u201cAnd if she can\u2019t then that\u2019s fine, too. If she\u2019s a signer, then she\u2019s a signer.\u201d Still, as we drive to the Learning Center, Christine tells me that she worries about her place in Ellie\u2019s future. No matter how hard she and Derek try, or how fluent they become in sign, they can never be Deaf. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s a culture where\u201d\u2014she pauses. \u201cWe are not allowed, my husband and I\u2014as supportive as we are, we can\u2019t be culturally Deaf.\u201d After we arrive in the classroom, Christine leans down and places the external part of the implant\u2014two magnetic circles\u2014on a spot just above each of Ellie\u2019s ears. We watch her play at the dollhouse while another kid cruises around the perimeter, his palms pushed flat against the walls for balance. The room is brightly lit, with blue-gray carpeting to cancel out background noise. In one exercise, a teacher, who is Deaf, asks everyone in the room\u2014three children, their caregivers, a teacher\u2019s aide, and an interpreter\u2014to come together in a circle. She signs to each child to pick a flash card and describe it. William, an adorable 2-year-old with an unruly head of blond hair, chooses one with pictures of Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street. \u201cOh, you know who that is,\u201d his dad says, in spoken English. The interpreter translates the father\u2019s words for William. The boy wriggles with excitement and signs \u201cErnie\u201d by \u201cdrawing\u201d horizontal stripes on his shirt\u2014his homemade sign for the character. Before I leave, I take a tour of the school and pass through an atrium, where a photographic mural wraps around three walls. It is a rendering of Deaf history, assembled by the late Deaf artist Chuck Baird. Among other touches, Baird used different colored frames to interpret the events in the photos. I spot a gold frame containing a 1988 photograph of students at Gallaudet University, the country\u2019s only deaf college, protesting the university\u2019s decision to hire a hearing president. Within a week, the protesters had prevailed\u2014and sparked wider reform. The Deaf President Now movement, as it came to be known, led to laws governing the use of subtitles on television, as well as other ways of providing deaf people with greater access to communications technology. On a wall across from the Gallaudet image large black letters spell \u201cMILAN\u201d, and below the letters hangs a photograph of a building\u2014the location of the 1880 conference that so damaged deaf culture.\n\nIn a room at the Northeast Cochlear Implant Convention, a group of teenagers has just received a lesson in hula hooping. The kids fan out across the room to practice rotating their hips to the heavy bass of dance music. An instructor whirls silently through the crowd, her hoop moving from hip to arm to hip in one long, fluid motion. Despite cajoling from her friends, a girl, dressed in T-shirt and jeans, is too embarrassed to give it a go. But she seems flattered by their concern. Kids with implants, I\u2019ve been told, love coming to this conference because they get to hang out with others like themselves. Most attend mainstream schools with few, if any, other deaf children. The three-day event, held every summer near Boston, is the largest gathering of its kind in New England. Hundreds attend: families of kids with implants, adults with implants, parents considering whether to implant their deaf babies, state and hospital staff hawking packets of information, and representatives from all the major cochlear implant companies. At one booth, an implant company called Advanced Bionics touts its latest breakthrough\u2014waterproof implants\u2014by giving out bright yellow rubber duckies. On my first evening there, I meet Rachel Chaikof, a petite woman with thick, dark hair that hides her processors. Chaikof is celebrated in the cochlear implant world. In 1989, when she was two and a half, she became one of the youngest implant recipients in the world. Her hearing parents declined to learn sign language and taught their daughter to talk through aggressive speech therapy. Today, Chaikof speaks almost naturally and is fluent in French. On her website, Cochlear Implant Online, Chaikof writes: \u201cEvery morning for the first few weeks, when I was a rough little three-year old child, my mother had to sit on me in order to get the magnet on my head [that enabled the cochlear implants to work]. I know that sounds cruel of my mother, but I am grateful to her for doing this because she has taught me that it is unimaginable to live in a silent world.\u201d Yet silence has a way of creeping up on those with implants. Later that evening, I stay up late talking to a group of people who grew up hearing but went deaf as adults. We\u2019re seated in the main hall of the convention hotel, just out of sight of people playing in the pool. Hearing devices are notoriously sensitive to background noise, and my companions are having a hard time hearing over the splashing. Chairs are moved as people stake out spots across from the person speaking so that they can lip read. I ask the man next to me how good his comprehension is. He has me repeat the question three times. With a wry laugh, he finally replies: \u201cIt\u2019s about a hundred percent.\u201d At lunch the following day, I meet Jennifer Colamedici, the hearing mom of a 12-year-old boy who was implanted at the now relatively late age of three. He\u2019s doing great academically, she says, but socially he\u2019s struggling, which Colamedici attributes to the fact that he\u2019s the only deaf kid in his grade. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she says, \u201cwe think to ourselves, \u2018Who is he going to take to prom?\u201d Colamedici has been considering putting him in a sign language class to see if that helps him find a niche. Historically, a kid like Colamedici\u2019s would have started his journey to a Deaf identity at a school for the deaf. But these schools have faded as budgets have been cut and children with hearing loss redirected to mainstream schools. Many deaf people I\u2019ve spoken to believe that Deaf culture will persevere nonetheless. Implanted children will seek out the Deaf community on their own, they say, and kids with cochlear implants will go to college, study sign, and gravitate toward each other. It may simply take longer than in years past. I\u2019m skeptical, though. When I leave the convention, the day is warm and several teens with implants are tossing a Frisbee around the hotel parking lot, yelling back and forth to each other. It\u2019s hard to picture these kids, who have little or no exposure to sign and whose friends and family are almost all hearing, embarking on that arduous journey to becoming Deaf.\n\nBy Skutnabb-Kangas\u2019s definition, Bill Corwin and his wife, Jennifer Rosner, are guilty of abetting linguicide. Corwin, who is hearing, is a former lawyer and current president of the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech, which is headquartered in Northampton, Massachusetts, and has satellite campuses across the East Coast. I meet Corwin and Rosner (also hearing), at a caf\u00e9 on a warm day in August. They\u2019ve brought their 13-year-old daughter Sophia, who wears hearing aids, and their 10-year-old daughter Juliet, who was born profoundly deaf and implanted at age one. Nobody in the family is proficient in sign. Over cookies, Corwin and Rosner tell me about wanting to keep their family unified. \u201cThe thing that gets lost in the whole conversation is the intimacy between parents and children in this scenario,\u201d says Rosner. Sharing complex thoughts would be difficult if the children relied on sign, and the parents on speech. \u201cAnd what does that do for relationships? That\u2019s what I find just astonishing about this debate. Just because they\u2019re born with some genetic [issue] then somehow they should have a different language and culture. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d Rosner, who\u2019s written a memoir called If a Tree Falls: A Family\u2019s Quest to Hear and Be Heard, says that their choices have generated nasty feedback, an example of which I stumble across in an article she wrote about Juliet and Sophia for the New York Times. \u201cHearing parents of Deaf children should be tried and convicted of child abuse and neglect,\u201d reads one comment. \u201cAnd the Deaf child should be given to Deaf parents for adoption.\u201d When they were younger, Juliet and Sophia went to preschool at Clarke, where the focus is on helping deaf children prepare for the hearing world. Today, both girls go to mainstream private schools, although they receive some occasional support. To tune out background noise, for instance, their teachers wear radios that channel speech directly to the girls\u2019 sensory devices. During class discussions, the students pull their chairs around the receiver. A few weeks after our discussion at the caf\u00e9, I meet with Corwin one-on-one. I ask him if he\u2019d have done things differently if his girls had been born before implants became widely available. Juliet\u2019s hearing loss is so profound that he would not have thrust her into the hearing world, he says. Without implants she would have been a signer. Yet, as we walk to our cars, Bill adds that he still worries about Juliet. Because she can\u2019t hear without her processors, she\u2019ll always identify as deaf\u2014without a capital D. But without sign, she cannot be part of the Deaf community. For Corwin, though, the onus is on the Deaf community to evolve, to learn to accept the growing number of deaf people like Juliet, who speaks so fluently that her deafness, at least to an outsider, is completely masked. What that translates to in reality is far from clear. Sign is the linchpin of Deaf culture. Remove it and a community will undoubtedly remain, but perhaps it will be akin to communities for quadriplegics or cancer survivors. And it would be a stretch to say that those communities have their own cultures.\n\nOn my last visit to the Reids, we eat pizza in their dining room while the Boston trains rumble by. Ellie, her processors out for the evening, devours an entire meaty slice. After dinner, she curls up on Christine\u2019s lap. They sign their way through the book Learn your ABCs with Elmo and Friends, before Derek and Christine tuck her into bed. Sitting in the living room while Ellie sleeps, I confess to Christine and Derek how dispirited I\u2019ve been feeling about the future of Deaf culture. So many families have already opted out. And those who do sign often rely on a mishmash of sign and spoken language\u2014informal hybrids that will likely make it difficult for their children to fit in with the culturally Deaf. Christine likens the state of sign language to Hebrew. \u201cIn America, are random Jews walking around speaking Hebrew to each other? They\u2019re not,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s revered in their communities.\u201d I counter that children are born into Jewish culture, as were their parents and their parents\u2019 parents. Deaf kids, on the other hand, often have to find it. And now, with cochlear implants, they have less incentive to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Christine says, turning the conversation from the philosophical to the practical. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to save the whole culture. We\u2019re just trying to allow her to be a part of it. That\u2019s it.\u201d The Reids didn\u2019t choose to have a deaf daughter, or to be thrust into an alien culture. They know that Ellie might choose a world that\u2019s beyond their reach. The best Christine and Derek can do is to give Ellie access to her Deaf heritage\u2014a sanctuary, should she need it, from a hearing world in which she may never feel fully at home. And if they help keep Deaf culture alive, then all the better. Before I leave, Christine and Derek invite me to join their nightly ritual: peeking in on Ellie as she sleeps. She is curled up on her side. The yellow Air Supply poster glows faintly behind us. Watching Ellie, it\u2019s hard to imagine what she\u2019ll be like as she grows up. Right now she\u2019s just a toddler who likes sparkly shoes and tall slides and terrorizing the family cat. But what about later? What kind of path will she take through life, and will it involve her Deaf heritage? \u201cIsn\u2019t she cute,\u201d Christine says, before we leave the room. \u201cYeah,\u201d says Derek, and jokes, \u201cWe really should have another baby.\u201d The two of them laugh so loudly that I want to shush them. But then I remember that Ellie sleeps without her processors. Her implants are turned off. For now, she is safe in the silence.

Forbes has a fantastic, in depth article about the founder, Jan Koum. The link to that article is below. It\u2019s definitely worth a read.\n\nEntrepreneurs can take a lot of flack from people who don\u2019t see their vision. It\u2019s true that a lot of ventures don\u2019t work out. It\u2019s not about being right all the time. It\u2019s about being wrong a lot of the time but being super right, when you\u2019re right. Jan Koum was super right.\n\nAs the Forbes article points out, Jan Koum incorporated WhatsApp on February 24th, 2009. That\u2019s about 1822 days from the publishing of the Forbes article mentioned in this post. Since he sold his app for $19 Billion and owns about 47%, he\u2019ll make roughly $6.8 Billion before taxes. That works out to be roughly $3.7 Million a day in profits since the second he incorporated WhatsApp.\n\nKoum couldn\u2019t have known that he\u2019d sell his app for the amount he would or even that he\u2019d have an exit at all. He did, however, believe in what he was building; and, that is very important.\n\nKoum signed his $19 Billion deal at an old building in Mountain View, CA \u2014 where he used to collect food stamps. That kind of moment is what all entrepreneurs long for. It\u2019s not the payday that we really desire (though we\u2019ll take that too)\u2026 it\u2019s to remember when we struggled to build something relevant. We want to remember moments when we were so close to giving up and despair was at our door but we kept going. We want to look back and see that during those hard times, we were actually making $$$.\n\nGo to the In Depth Forbes Article"

        "text": "Have you ever seen someone fall asleep cuddling a Microsoft Surface tablet? I haven\u2019t. I have however seen people snoozing away with their iPad Mini underneath them, running silently while contently pumping Mozart and Foster the People into their dreaming minds. How many times have you fallen asleep with your iPod or iPhone? For me, I won\u2019t even attempt to count. It\u2019s a lot. Like, at least 9.\n\nThe difference between, say, an iPad and a Surface tablet, isn\u2019t very complicated. The Surface is a black slab of rubbery cornered computing power. Yes, I contend, at first glance it is pretty. But then you flip it over\u2026 Then you turn it on. And it becomes infinitely less pretty. The iPad, however, is a silvery hued slate of anodized aluminum, matte to the touch. You flip it over, you don\u2019t see a window. You see an apple. AN APPLE. With a bite out of it. Who thinks of that? How cool to have something so ordinary, beautiful, and healthy on the back of a tablet! A shiny, chrome apple. Distinct yet subtle. What does the Surface have on it? A line for a stand and \u201cSurface\u201d written in something akin to Arial.\n\nApple creates its designs with the relationship in mind. Every step of the way, Jony Ive\u2019s team is wondering \u201cWill people want to use this everyday? Will they be embrassed to use it? Does it look good? Does it feel good?\u201d Other companies don\u2019t put as much thought into this. LG, for example, creates a curved phone. What\u2019s the purpose? To look cool? It doesn\u2019t. The closest approximate to the way Apple designs is Kobo, a Canadian eReader company that 90% of Americans have never heard of. Kobo makes beautiful devices with design in mind. The Nook=bleh. Kobo Aura=oh yeah. Apple and Kobo design devices that make you not want to put them down. Ever. They become your constant companions, your precious friends. The iPad is so thin and light, you forget it\u2019s in your bag. The rounded edges and thin bezels give the sense that nothing is wasted. This device feels like it\u2019s meant to last a lifetime. People feel comfortable with these aspects, and thus feel comfortable with the device."

        "title": "Wearables? Beware! \u2013",
        "text": "We\u2019re in the middle of a major surge of wearable consumer electronic products. Originally, these devices were purely for fitness: Nike, Fitbit, Jawbone, etc use basic sensors (like accelerometers) to track activity throughout the day and motivate healthy behaviour. As the wearables market matures, there are an increasing number of startups building wearable devices with more specific (and frankly, more useful) sensors and use cases. Bionym (Nymi), Quanttus, Ringly, Novasentis, Narrative (Memoto), Telepathy, etc are all seeking to differentiate themselves by addressing more specific problems.\n\nWearables are a highly interesting new product category that will attract lots of new entrants. But young startups should proceed with caution. These products are exceptionally hard to build. I mean really, really hard. Here are some things to watch out for:\n\nWearable devices live on the body and must appeal to users\u2019 sense of style. Device makers need to address function but they also must design for fashion. Appealing to fashion means continuous updates, expensive materials, high-quality finishes, and complex aesthetic features. It also means that a product which works perfectly well can still fail due to current taste. Google Glass may be one of the most fantastic products ever developed (the jury is still out on that) but because it fundamentally changes the way a user\u2019s face looks, purchasing one will always be a product decision AND a fashion decision.\n\nWearables can be on the body 10+ hours per day. They will get splashed, washed, dropped, burned, and of course chewed on. Building products that can survive such a wide range of environments isn\u2019t impossible, but it sure is hard, especially when you factor things like radio communication, battery life, and comfort.\n\nEven experienced companies that have been building products for years have trouble with durability. Jawbone\u2019s first production run of UP bracelets were 100% recalled due to an improperly sized power capacitor. While the company hasn\u2019t published numbers on the recall, I\u2019d guess tens of thousands of refunds were issued costing the company millions of dollars and irreparable PR damage. To their credit, Jawbone handled the recall better than almost any company I can remember. If Jawbone was a startup and this was their first product, they would surely be out of business.\n\nAnything making contact with the human body needs to be comfortable. Products should feel light, but not cheap. When users don\u2019t want to notice/interact with them, they should be easily hidden or removable. Human skin is also sensitive. Fitbit recently issued a massive recall due to a possible allergic reaction to nickel (an alloying element) in a stainless steel part on the Flex\u2019s band. Large recalls are not easy to recover from.\n\nUsers want to feel unique when it comes to fashion accessories. Trying to incorporate even a basic set of options for color and size can easily yield 10s of permutations of the same product. In the hardware world we call these \u201cSKUs\u201d. Each SKU requires additional tooling, components, packaging, logistics, and customer support/returns. A small startup offering 10 SKUs has a ton of management overhead compared with managing a single product, and managing one product is no walk in the park.\n\nThese product dynamics mean some customers will be unhappy with the products they purchase. Many early adopters of fitness trackers report returning products multiple times due to poor performance, useless data, or complete product failure after normal usage. Most consumer electronics OEMs usually have return rates of 2% or less. I\u2019ve heard rumors of wearable device companies dealing with 10% returns. Any time return rates are this high, support costs are usually multiple times higher. Every time a product is returned, there are usually 5 additional touch points with the customer: a support email, a support call, return of original product, inspection, and replacement, all for a financial loss. This dramatically affects the cash flow (and brand) of the business.\n\nIn addition to all the technical challenges of wearable products, the business dynamics add a new element of complexity for young startups. Large, well-funded companies have entered the market with strong brands and experienced teams. Many of the existing products\u2019 core technology is quite simple and has little to no protectable competitive advantage. For example, Apple\u2019s new M7 motion co-processor could easily dislodge all existing fitness tracker products if the developer community embraces it. Companies like Nike have massive marketing cach\u00e9, cash flow, and distribution networks. As a small, venture backed startup it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to compete in this kind of business landscape."

        "text": "Through the Hackbright Academy fellowship program, I built a VideoSync web application to automatically synchronize and play crowd-sourced video clips. A user can provide YouTube links or upload videos of the same song, and play back the synchronized clips to recreate the concert from multiple perspectives. VideoSync utilizes HTML5 video and JavaScript for front end development and Python for back end signal processing algorithms. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nThe main challenge in achieving the application\u2019s functionality was to determine the time at which the videos overlap, since the start and end times of each clip vary. This synchronization is achieved based on peak frequencies in the audio component of the videos.\n\nYouTube Link or File Upload: To start this process, the YouTube videos are downloaded as MP4 files with the youtube-dl command line program. User-uploaded videos are simply stored on the server.\n\nWAV File: The audio is stripped from these video files using the avconv audio/video converter, which is read using the Python SciPy library.\n\nFourier Transform of Audio Signal: In order to analyze frequencies of the audio samples across time, the audio data needs to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, which can be achieved by using the Fourier transform. To preserve the time dimension in the data, the audio is split into bins, at a size of 1024 samples per bin. The Fourier transform is then applied to each bin using the NumPy library, which converts each bin\u2019s data from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nPeak Frequencies: With the data now represented in the frequency domain, the next step of the analysis is to identify the frequency with the highest intensity in each bin and create a peak frequency constellation. In the diagram above, each peak frequency is represented as an X.\n\nFrequency Constellation Alignment: Finally, the time offset is determined by aligning the frequency constellations of the two audio files. This can be visualized as two transparencies overlapping and sliding horizontally until the peak frequencies align in both graphs. The distance one transparency needs to be slid past the start of the other transparency is the time offset of the two videos.\n\nVideo Playback: With this time offset information for the video pair, coordinated playback of the videos is triggered in the front-end of the application with JavaScript/jQuery.\n\nThe process described above was not my first approach in developing the synchronization algorithm. Other techniques explored include dynamic time warping and direct spectogram comparison. The final algorithm was fine-tuned for speed and accuracy through experimentation with different Fourier transformation bin sizes, bin overlapping, and adding a horizontal grid component to frequency constellation mapping.\n\nI plan to eventually revisit this project and add the ability to synchronize more than two videos, as well as further refine the synchronization algorithm by applying additional audio filters and incorporating video location data into the algorithm."

        "title": "Backbeam.io: One BaaS to rule them all? \u2013 Steffen D. Sommer \u2013",
        "text": "I admit it, I am a sucker for services that just works out-of-the-box. Ever since I found out that I wanted to be an iOS developer, I\u2019ve been a fan of BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) providers. As an iOS developer I want to focus on writing applications on not worrying on my backend, but still have the flexible of designing the backend to my needs. Because of that, I\u2019ve been playing around with many BaaS providers for quite a while and this is my five cent on my recent discovery: Backbeam.io. I prefer things which are simple yet powerful. My perfect BaaS would support all of my needs, but at the same time being elegant and simple. My minimum requirements for using a BaaS are as follows: 1) data management; 2) server-side logic; 3) push notifications; 4) a reasonable pricing model and of course stability and scalability. A lot of services supports this functionality and some of the biggest I\u2019ve been using are Parse, Firebase, Kinvey and PubNub. Not to mention open source projects such as Deployd and BaasBox. Although I\u2019ve been happily using Parse and Firebase without the big hassle for quite some time, I do feel like there aren\u2019t a service which provides it all.\n\nRecently I stumbled across Backbeam.io. I was surprised I\u2019ve never heard it before, and I must admit I kinda had the feeling that it was too good to be true. Backbeam.io is another BaaS, providing a wide range of features. It is one of the services, in my opinion, that somehow tries to solve it all. Here are some of the cool features of Backbeam.io: If you\u2019re on the PRO subscription (which everybody is at the moment), every project you create on Backbeam.io includes a development and a production environment. This makes it a lot easier to avoid polluting your production database. Another cool thing about Backbeam.io is the ability to version your backend. Let\u2019s say you want to change the way your backend works or you just needs to test new functionality before putting it into production. Backbeam.io does a great job making this easy for you. Although I am not a big fan of developing code in the browser, Backbeam.io\u2019s approach to cloud code or server logic is pretty straightforward. You simply just create controllers for the paths you want to override. Another cool feature which has just been added a few days ago is the ability to test the server logic right in the Backbeam.io dashboard.\n\nAlthough I feel like Backbeam.io has come a long way, there are still room for improvements. Here are some of my thoughts on how they could improve: After playing around with Backbeam.io for some hours I contacted the guys on Twitter and afterwards on email. Simply for the reason that I felt that their site was lacking information about who they were and about the technical foundation for their service. Being open about the technical details of one\u2019s service, ads credibility in my honest opinion (unless you can name drop some big customers). In other words, if someone are going to put a lot of hours in working with your service and at the same time rely on your setup, you better be open about how it works. They responded that is it built using Node.js and NoSQL with scalability in mind. At the moment the servers of Backbeam.io are located in Europe. They told me that they were looking into moving the servers to New York in order to be located close to the majority of their users \u2014 The American ones and at the same time be located somehow close to Europe. I think this solution is okay for the moment, I however would prefer to be able to choose my server location in the future. As mentioned earlier, developing in the browser just seems odd to me. It makes it harder to collaborate with other users and you simply just want to use your own local development environment. Another thing is that you are dependent on having an internet connection which limits the possibilities on working with Backbeam.io while being offline. They announced on Twitter that there would be an open source version later this year. This is somehow connected with my feedback on being transparent. When being highly dependent on a service like Backbeam.io I would really like to know how backups are being supported. Ideally I would be interested in doing manual backups and restoring from older backups. They told me that they were currently working on supporting manual backups. I\u2019m a big fan of BaaS in general and I think we\u2019ve come a long way. Backbeam.io could end up as a big player in the market if they continue to push out great features. Specially since they have the possibility to do it now, unlike Parse which I feel respond really slow with new features. This is my first article on Medium and this is my way of spreading the word about Backbeam.io and helping them getting even more awesome. Good luck guys! PS: No, I do not work at Backbeam.io."

        "text": "In this essay, I investigate why users create junk and present my argument on why I believe we should all trust our users.\n\nIMO there are only THREE reasons why a user would create junk in your app. None of which is their fault!\n\nA lot of times we leave our users in the dark trying to figure stuff out on their own. In their ambitious quest for understanding your app they inevitably create junk or unwelcome content.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what users feel, left alone in our seemingly \u201cintuitive\u201d app!\n\nJust having a sign-up tutorial with a jazzy image carousel usually does not make the cut! Our users deserve more directions to create greater content.\n\nGreat content apps typically use two techniques to incentivise their users.\n\nOne technique is by giving out direct incentive like \u201ccredits\u201d for creating quality content (StackExchange, HackerNews, Quora). Carrot-and-sticks usually help communities reach a stage where everyone agrees on certain types of content they\u2019d like to see. The other is indirect incentives like Twitter\u2019s Retweets and Favourites, Medium\u2019s Recommends, Jelly\u2019s Goods etc. where a users contribution is not quantified.\n\nErgo \u2014 Unless users understand the incentives of creating quality content, they would usually create crap! Simple.\n\nFace it. Power users are the only family your early-stage product has! They help nurture your pixels and code into a quality content platform. Hence, it\u2019s really important that such power users feel important and special in our app.\n\nGiving out extra capabilities to curate & moderate content being generated could be a good start (a la StackOverflow, Reddit). But I think it needs to go another step further. We need to provide prime placement to such power users where they can show off their creations. Many successful content platforms are already doing this, for example Twitter\u2019s Discover feed, Medium\u2019s Top 100, Instagram\u2019s popular feed, HackerNews\u2019 popular etc.\n\nShowcasing content not only directs the community toward your ideally desired direction, but also educates new users by example. This becomes crucial for new content platforms to avoid junk."

No, that was not a typo.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean that in a teenybopper kind of way (sorry to disappoint). Remember how exciting it was when all those companies were springing up out of nowhere, shaking up industries left and right? I\u2019m talking about companies like Google and Xanga\u2014which led to Myspace, Facebook, and\u2026more Google. Then there\u2019s the app gold rush that we\u2019re still in the middle of right now. WhatsApp can thank the late 90s for paving the way to the $19 billion they just banked.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we\u2019ll look back on today in about 10 years.\n\nThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll remember 2014 for more than just hipsters and selfies.

The same kinds of developers who\u2019ve been launching software companies are now switching to hardware. That in itself says a lot. Think about it\u2014the talent that is known for industry disruption is now migrating.\n\nTake Kickstarter for example. If you look on their site right now, there are 1,300 hardware projects listed (it was 1,299\u2014but it went up by 1 while I was writing this post). And that number is only going to grow. Ever heard of incubators like 500 Startups or Y Combinator? Well, there are ones dedicated specifically to hardware, like HAXLR8R in San Francisco. The program sends hardware startup teams to China for 3 months to design, source, and build their prototypes\u2014then return in search of financing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think that\u2019s really cool\u2014then this one-way, anonymous, online friendship of ours is never going to work.\n\nYou sound confused. Let me help. Right now, there\u2019s a radical shift in the barrier to entry for hardware products. Supply chain provider companies are making the cost of manufacturing and risk super small, encouraging brilliant minds to ditch software for hardware. And as hardware becomes easier to produce, older companies like HP are bailing out because this brave new world is too fast for them (literary reference for the win).\n\nJoi Ito, Director of MIT Media Lab, is well known for bringing science-fiction concepts to mainstream reality. In reflection of hardware being the new software, he explains:\n\nSounds like we\u2019ve got just the solution."

        "text": "The reason we\u2019ve chosen to write about ribot Days now, after having done it for about 4 years, is that it feels like it\u2019s reached a stage of maturity and level of learning that would, we think, be beneficial to share with others.\n\nAnd it\u2019s changed a lot. We\u2019ve tweaked this, questioned that, and I\u2019d like to share some of the problems we\u2019d faced, and how we dealt with them.\n\nWhen ribot Days first started, there was very little structure around when these days would take place. They\u2019d also take place on an individual basis, rather than as a group. People would have what was known as a \u2018gold card\u2019, which they\u2019d individually allocate to a given single day in their calendar. This concept didn\u2019t work very well, as they felt like there was never an appropriate time for them to use their card.\n\nWe decided that we needed to allocate a given day to the practice, for a number of reasons:\n\n\u2022 It sets an expectation about an upcoming, unmovable and repeatable event\n\n\u2022 Everyone would use their gold card at the same time, bringing about greater collaboration and sense of occasion\n\n\u2022 A single, regular day is easier both to communicate with all clients, and for them to recall.\n\nThis had profound effects for the concept. Motivation and collaboration both blossomed, and the set time structure removed the (somewhat unnecessary) need to choose a time. It also allowed for us to create ceremonial events both during (Fondue Night; ribot Cinema) and at the end of each ribot Day, where we\u2019d present our cogs and concepts back to the group.\n\nTo begin with, the sheer luxury of allocating service time to innovation and thinking was an excitement in and of itself. However, we found that there wasn\u2019t enough structure around the innovation, namely around areas of focus and planning. People couldn\u2019t choose what to work on, because there was too much choice. Vital time was wasted during the innovation period that could have been spent much more efficiently.\n\nThe solution was initially the setup of a pre-planning meeting, where we\u2019d sit around a table and openly discuss our ideas, who\u2019d work on what with whom. We also have been lightly dabbling with themes, though this is in the early stages.\n\nWe\u2019ve evolved the process since. Now, we individually share our ideas for how we\u2019ll use the time within a ribot Days Basecamp thread, and continue the conversation in a special ribot Days Skype room. It had a profound effect on the level of conversation and self-organisation that, to some curious extent, was missing when we\u2019d meet physically. Most importantly, though, it meant we weren\u2019t wasting time any more.\n\nProblem: Not enough time to innovate deeply\n\nEven with pre-planning sorted, we felt we could only do so much in 8 hours, a point brought up in our monthly \u2018riFresh\u2019 meeting, where we all sit around at a table and chat about high level company stuff. It was felt that we could only do so much in a single day, especially with time spent prepping the presentation at the end of the day, which made ribot Days more stressful than was necessary for adequate focus.\n\nIn that meeting, we collectively agreed to trial a two-day ribot Day. This allowed us more time to work through our concepts and cogs in more detail, and crucially, with an evening in the middle, more time to reflect, think, and reassess expectations and focus. As a result, the trial has become standard and, despite its name, ribot Day is now a two-day affair.\n\nProblem: Issues around awareness and why we do ribot Days.\n\nSo, as mentioned earlier, we\u2019re a service company, doing work predominantly for other companies. One issue we faced was that we generally didn\u2019t factor in ribot Day time into project pre-planning, because it was so new, unestablished and without too much structure at the time. It was certainly difficult to retrofit, once collective expectations were set for a given project.\n\nWhat that then meant was that we had to be almost apologetic when flagging that we have \u2018this thing we do\u2019 each month. It didn\u2019t make sense, because there are benefits to all.\n\nShifting to a collective period for ribot Days has made things a lot easier. We now tell clients we\u2019re essentially closed for two days per month, but we\u2019re still flexible, if any major releases are imminent. We now give plenty of notice and even invite our clients in to take part. As well as coming up with great ideas together, this invitation helps break down any fears around what they might feel our true priorities are.\n\nProblem: Trying to achieve too much\n\nNaturally, ribot Days are an exciting affair, with everyone wanting to make the most of the time, and come up with the most amazing things. However, we have a limited period of time, and we tended to over-estimate how much was achievable in such a time. The shift from one to two days also required a reconfiguring of expectations.\n\nThe solution was really two things. Firstly, it\u2019s an education for the team \u2014 Antony and I had prior experience at other companies of these innovation periods, and we consistently communicate to the team the importance of keeping the task small and achievable.\n\nBut no matter what you say, the best way to learn is to go through the experience, getting it wrong a few times, realising what then feels achievable, and adjusting expectations in future months.\n\nGetting serious with the bigger projects\n\nIt\u2019s not so much of a problem, but more a yearning to take some of the bigger ideas borne out of ribot Day further. Frustrations around wishing to launch and subsequently maintain some of these creations have been plentiful. They require nurturing within an internal product-focused incubator which, until now, we\u2019ve just not had the resources to set up. They also require on-going support after birth.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve now hired an experienced COO with product experience, who will help oversee and define core structural changes for the appropriate product / service mix at ribot. A lot of digital agencies have been itching to get into product recently, but few have done it well, perhaps with the exception of UsTwo and a few others.\n\nTo go from two days per month to a full-blown product division is a significant jump for a small service company like ribot but, as well as the risks and resource requirements, we understand the myriad benefits it will bring in the future."

        "text": "It\u2019s 1991. In a conference theatre in Las Vegas everyone has been handed paddles. One side of the paddle is black and the other side has coloured reflective tape. Half the of the room has red paddles, the other side green. Then a very familiar image appeared on the screen and the crowd quickly worked out what the paddles were for.\n\nHis set-up involved a camera that would gauge the number of paddles with the colour facing forward and interpret these as votes for up and any facing the other way as votes for down. Whichever direction was currently winning for each team controlled the current direction of movement for that team\u2019s paddle. The crowd quickly adapted, and collectively played one of the oldest videogames in a way that was never intended by its creators.\n\nPong was first released in 1972 \u2014 around 20 years before Carpenter\u2019s experiment. Eighteen years after Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s initial release its time has come for a crowd-control re-invention. An anonymous developer has hooked the chat from game-streaming site Twitch back into the game of Pok\u00e9mon Red being streamed to create Twitch Plays Pokemon (TPP) \u2014 a game that allows the audience to control the character by typing \u2018left\u2019, \u2018right\u2019, etc into the chat.\n\nThis similar 20 year time lag isn\u2019t a coincidence. For these experiments to work the audience needs to have an understanding of how the game would work normally to have any hope of coordinating in a crowd and Pok\u00e9mon, like Pong in the \u201890s, is a (fairly) universal experience for a certain generation.\n\nAs well as Pok\u00e9mon being a much more complicated task than Pong, TPPers are also held back by the 30 second delay between input and action in the game \u2014 making errors more common then they might be otherwise. This means TPP has a lot in common with other \u2018deliberately hard to control\u2019 games like QWOP and Surgeon Simulator 2013.\n\nWith thousands of people contributing commands, the results can be slow and there\u2019s frequent backsliding. All the work taken to get through a small gap can be undone by someone hitting down to jump back over a ledge (these are only passable in one direction and have been proved a major problem for TPPers). Even common tasks like depositing and withdrawing Pok\u00e9mon from the computer are now fraught with the the danger of accidentally releasing valuable Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nBut despite all that, there is remarkable forward progress, with the crowd collectively defeating gym leaders, catching new pok\u00e9mon and making their way across the world.\n\nThis is the most interesting aspect of Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon: how on earth is this possible? Carpenter\u2019s Pong was a simple \u2018yes/no\u2019 dynamic with instant feedback. Pok\u00e9mon is a complicated game with strategy elements, rosters and inventory, and a complicated map to explore \u2014 how is the player not still banging his head against a wall in Pallet Town?\n\nThe first explanation is to question that the tasks being performed are actually that hard. Pok\u00e9mon as a game is fairly forgiving of mistakes, the player isn\u2019t going to starve to death when it takes hours to get over a ledge. If all of your pok\u00e9mon are defeated, you black out and wake up at the last pok\u00e9mon center you visited with your team fully healed. The only downside to this is losing progress in the journey and money \u2014 but for TPP navigating the menus required to exchange money for items (let along use those items) is so complicated this is less of an issue than it might otherwise be.\n\nAs a result of repeatedly trying to get past wild pok\u00e9mon and trainers, the players\u2019 pok\u00e9mon will level up at least a little bit each time, and so will find it easier to get through these obstacles each time. The result of what is effectively brownian motion (as the player is fed \u2018left, up,right,down, right,left, right\u2019) in the routes between towns means the player is often wandering around randomly in the tall grass having battles \u2014 which helps level pok\u00e9mon up for the battles against gym leaders. TPP\u2019s control system in the easy bits of the game force the player to grind and prepare for the hard bits of the game.\n\nThis explains that in principle TPP is a winnable problem but less so how with so many voices, only some of whom are aware of any current goal, anything constructive is happening. This is a fairly common question for democratic theory generally \u2014 given that surveys show there\u2019s always a fairly large segment of voters who effectively have no idea what the issues are or why they\u2019re voting for things, how is this working? This situation is a bit of a snag for democratic theory, which rather depends on it being true that asking these people what should be done is not only necessary, but is going to produce better decisions than not asking them.\n\nSome democratic theorists argue that it doesn\u2019t really matter if people are completely uninformed \u2014 if they really have no idea what they\u2019re doing they\u2019re effectively voting randomly and so will cancel each other out, leaving the true democratic signal to emerge from the noise[1].\n\nThis runs into problems if the uninformed aren\u2019t voting randomly (and there are any number of factors that can influence people\u2019s voting behavior) and in TPP\u2019s case, there\u2019s a clump around the current correct move and another around the correct move on the previous turn because of the time lag. This becomes a huge deal in a menu system or a maze, but when the choice is simply \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 and the direction of the map at that point is right, the player is over time going to end up in that direction. It might not be quick, but eventually the noise cancels out and progress is made. When stuck in a fiddly bit, brownian motion will eventually get the player through it, while the general direction of play kicks back into action if the player wanders too far from the situation.\n\nTo resolve the incredibly tricky bits, people also have the option of fighting over how to play the game itself. Twitch Plays Pokemon has two modes: Anarchy and Democracy and players can vote for either at any time \u2014 if the slider reaches 80% for democracy, the game mode switches until anarchy is back to 50% support. In Anarchy mode everyone that anyone enters happens, in Democracy mode there\u2019s a twenty second period where actions are tallied and the winning action is performed. The idea of this is when things get too hard to get through randomly, democracy lets them take slower, more deliberate actions. However, this can have mixed results because the time lag makes the \u2018still trying to do the last thing\u2019 factor even more pronounced \u2014 menu systems are only usable if more people are managing to think ahead than people who aren\u2019t.\n\nWhile Democracy allows moves to be chained together like \u2018left2up6' these very rarely win, with wins usually ending up around the common denominators of the basic move \u2014 coordinating complicated options around thousands of players is difficult. That said, at time of press there\u2019s a faction trying to use a long combo \u2018b5a4downadown5a\u2019 (which gets out of all menus, then enters the right commands to do what they want) to resolve the six hour PC stalemate but are running into problems with the game processing long combos. It is really difficult to make this game do what you want.\n\nIn general it\u2019s hard to attribute success to great feats of coordination. Moments of failure are often temporary and once bypassed forgotten, only success means the game can progress. For every success (capturing Zapdos with the Masterball) there\u2019s an abject failure (buying the fire stone rather than the water stone to evolve Eevee). Generally the game moves forward because success is locked in and failure rarely is. Meanwhile there\u2019s a never ending stream of people in all time zones that enter the right direction more often than not. While the community jokingly attribute agency to the helix fossil the player is always selecting at inopportune moments, they also tend to over-estimate their own agency in the game. The most you can really say is that players are collectively choosing goals, but it\u2019s much harder to argue they have much influence over the time it takes to achieve them."

A new technology does not merely add something; it changes everything.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Neil Postman\n\nNew technology is born and crowds its ancestors out faster than any organic species on Earth. Devices change, interfaces change, and the code and materials that power them is perpetually changing. Tens of millions of people every day are tasked to conceive, create and deliver chemicals, molds, mathematics, packages and the machinery to reproduce more techno-creatures that command our attention.\n\nLook beyond the mountains of e-waste we create with our fascination for next; lift your head from your own handheld device and observe the rapid cultural change that is transforming how we behave.\n\nSleeping is now the longest period of time you go without touching a piece of ABS plastic or Gorilla glass.\n\nHow many conversations have you had recently where you\u2019re paying more attention to your device than the humans speaking to you? Is this a new era of manners, or the end of established ones?\n\nHow much time do you spend watching one device and working another?\n\nWe cry at Apple commercials of teenagers whose device is glued to their hands while their families beg their attention, or marvel to see an iPad travel where George Mallory could not.\n\nTech can let us do so many new things, but like Spiderman\u2019s powers that let him see and interact with the world differently, it utterly transforms us. There is no going back. (Barring an explosion at Yosemite.)\n\nThe tools of our tools, or happy symbiants? Tech whispers sweet nothings to us\u2026it pretends to make us smarter. But then again, why should we remember facts, methods or themes when we can look them up at any time? Is that knowledge? Wisdom? Or handicapping?\n\nIs it all bad?

        "text": "Angelist is a top start-up content aggregator for VCs, Angels, entrepreneurs and now job seekers for these firms and the connections. With connections, come knowledge and experience. F6s.com is an application and community platform for accelerators and incubators. However, Angelist has recently started syndicating deals of investors which means a group of investors pool their resources and fund start-ups similar to a VC consortium. Syndicating means an Angel or Fund can lead the syndicate with $10,000 to $500,000 per investment. Investors back the syndicate and invest alongside the lead. This is similar to crowdfunding, which is less structured.\n\nThe top ranked US accelerators from this site were: YCombinator (now just turned into a VC), 500 start-ups (also now call themselves a VC with 20,424 followers), Techstars, and Angelpad. Smaller accelerators with high quality industry focus include:\n\n\u00b7 Angelist ranks are based on qualitative measures (signal), qualitatively (followers or jobs created).\n\n\u00b7 In Canada, Extreme Startups is top ranked on this list that is also on Techvibes 2011 top Canadian list.\n\nThese firms have access to capital up to venture capital of about $100-250 million for R&D with an average of firm valuation of $3.8 million. York Angels, for instance, becomes worried or dubious with valuations over $1 million because of addressable market, and their ability to make deals happen.\n\nRecent Changes to the Top US Accelerators\n\nYCombinator\u2019s and 500 Startups are both now categorized as VCs (not accelerators). YCombinator has also changed their portfolio companies to become incubators. For example, AirBnB is now considered a technology incubator and has acquired, Crashpadder. This down line growth-building, almost like an apprenticeship program, facilitates direct fast knowledge and relationship transfer to further drive growth. This approach results in faster technology innovation and talent acquisition because these guys are already programming for free. It is exponentially driving growth in this way through early M&A.\n\nThis approach also delays hiring talented B-school MBAs because hacks have a singular focus: deliver disruptive technology and make money. They dispense with the rest (economics, human resources, finance, strategy, and marketing) believing they can be hired later.\n\nWhat Canadians Accelerators Must Do\n\nCanadians are a behind in this regard and we need to execute this concept faster and better to leapfrog our US neighbours and add value and change the game. Accelerators and investors must build strong relationships with R&D arms with global 500 innovators directly. We must reach out beyond the US and drive international relationships in Asia and Europe.\n\nB-Schools like Rotman, Ivy, the University of Waterloo are not far behind, but need to catching up to entrepreneurial training and started Rotman\u2019s Creative Destruction Lab in 2012. These b-schools just need to be more intense with their creative-destruction / constructive-conflict paradox. As for entrepreneurs, if you\u2019re serious, you need to move to one of these 3 locations. It will be much harder if you don\u2019t.\n\nHands-down the best of the best. Google has confirmed this by setting up shop on Campus beside the accelerators. You have to move 2 hours outside of Toronto. It shows you\u2019re serious. Enough said.\n\nOur accelerators need to be actively engaged in funding as well as knowledge management and support\u2014smaller amounts of seed capital for proof of concept and traction and lots more start-ups since one in 10 will fair or pivot.\n\n\u00b7 Waterloo has the best accelerators and ICT researchers with Hyperdrive, Communitech, and Velocity because of proximity to world class researchers and their students.\n\nSo for Canada, it\u2019s Waterloo, Waterloo and Toronto. Unfortunately, Vancouver didn\u2019t make the cut. However, of note, SFU and UBC have PhD programs and curriculum in family-run businesses as Asian firms are now making headway in innovation. These firms have a different mentality (social and family networks) with incredible spending power (Huawei and Lenovo, for example).\n\nToronto is a great city. Lots of distractions but it means you might get less done as a cohort start-up. MaRS underperforms compared to US YCombinator, Techstars, and 500 Startups. Better than Montreal\u2019s FounderFuel and Vancouver\u2019s GrowLab, for now. But Toronto has 2 well-regarded accelerators ranked by Angelist: Extreme Ventures and Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Toronto (Rotman School of Business). I met with both of these teams and they are welcoming, friendly, helpful and serious.\n\nMaRs has great backers, and programs but starts their entrepreneurs too slowly. With classes and sessions called \u201cEntrepreneur101\u201d the programs appears to be targeted at pre-college youngsters, and assumes their incubation teams are relative \u201cnoobs.\u201d In this regard, MaRS has misses the mark.\n\nHacks are brilliant and will learn as fast as MBAs and will challenge those who try to hold them back. They get bored and agitate teachers, cheat, take corners to one-up others and drop out of school because they want to change the world and make a billion dollars. We need teams that are willing to take calculated risks, without breaking serious laws, and cut in front of the line.\n\nMars programs are 6 months, double the time of some others in the US. It should consider also doing a 3 month program for extreme acceleration. They give out $50,000 for 9%.\n\nExtreme Startups is a 6 month program, and delivers $200,000 for 10%.\n\nZuckerberg, Jobs and Gates all dropped out of school. These innovators may have used \u2018mental accounting\u2019 and calculated their opportunity cost of an MBA and chose to lead blindly. They ran hard, hired talent and developed patents later. And, just wanted to make a ton of money.\n\nCertainly, that\u2019s what their VCs wanted.\n\nAl Leong is formerly a writer for TechVibes.

        "text": "As if AutoCorrect weren't pesky enough as it is, AutoCorrect suggestions don\u2019t respond to sliding down the keyboard, and remain suspended in the message frame.\n\nNotice the position of the scrollbar on the right hand side of the screen. If the message chain has reached its end, why does it seem as if there is still much left to scroll through? This puts it in perspective:\n\nLike AutoCorrect suggestions, the scrollbar does not initially respond to sliding down the keyboard. Granted, while this scenario is common, it is very temporary. Immediately after you remove your finger from the screen, the scrollbar restores itself to the proper position.\n\nHolding the screen in portrait mode, volume control is intuitive: the top button raises the volume, and the bottom button lowers it. Turn the phone clockwise to landscape mode, so the home button is on the left, and volume control is still intuitive \u2014 perhaps even more so than in portrait mode. The button on the right (previously the top button) adds volume bars, and the button on the left takes away volume bars.\n\nBut, turn the phone counter-clockwise so the home button is to the right of the screen, and things get hairy. Now, the button on the left increases the volume, adding bars to the right. The button on the right lowers the volume, taking away bars. The philosophy behind this design is most likely that the two volume control buttons should maintain their functions in all three orientations: the up-button should raise the volume, and the down-button should lower it. The problem occurs when the up-button is to the left of the down-button, which, unfortunately, is very often.\n\nWallpapers can be set from two locations: the Wallpapers & Brightness menu option in Settings, and directly from Photos. Both methods lead to the preview screen above to the left. At this point, you have not yet specified whether the wallpaper is for the home screen or the lock screen. But, the preview shows the wallpaper as it would be on the lock screen only.\n\nTapping \u201cSet\u201d yields the screen above to the right. It is here that you are prompted to specify which screen you want the wallpaper for. Nowhere are you given the option to preview the wallpaper on the home screen.\n\nI originally said I would keep this post strictly to flaws, but this last one is perhaps more of a pet peeve. From the lock screen, you have four options: swipe right for the keypad, swipe down for the Notification Center, swipe up for the Control Panel, and swipe up for the camera.\n\nA frustrating issue caused by the multitude of swipe options is getting stuck on the camera. After swiping up to access the camera, there is no way to return to the lock screen using swipe controls; you can only do so by pressing the lock button or the home button. Swiping down would be intuitive, but that activates the Notification Center.\n\nThere are four cardinal directions, and four options on the lock screen. Why not enable swipe left for the camera?"

They would tell you all the stats on the possibilities of ever reaching the limelight: \u201cJoe, only one in every [insert discouraging denominator] boy makes it to the NBA!\u201d But you know what they say about stats right? Ninety-nine percent of them are made up of no backing.\n\nStill, you probably didn\u2019t make it to the NBA, but you could have done something that would prove more beneficial to your life and the lives of your family. At the age of ten, I picked up a shovel one cold winter morning to venture through Swarthmore, PA. The city was a ghost town. A winter wonderland with no visitors anywhere to be found \u2014 the people had withdrawn from their normal activities.\n\nWe were poor, but we got by. My mom took good care of the family, and continues to this day. But on that snowy morning in 2003, when she offered me her five dollars to grab breakfast, I respectfully declined. I told her I had to go. You can\u2019t get through life accepting handouts every step of the way. You need to make your own money, your own way. Its waiting for you somewhere out there and you can find it if you just go on a journey through town.\n\nI traveled the town for ten years parsing each block for the ones who either weren\u2019t physically able to clear their own property of snow, or those who just didn\u2019t feel like it. There\u2019s this suggestion that if you look hard enough, you will find what you\u2019re looking for. I was looking for the big bucks, so I did things that most others wouldn\u2019t bother doing. Do the things other people won\u2019t do and you will find what you\u2019re looking for, as I did. I quickly became the richest kid in town. My elderly neighbors all spoiled me. They loved me, and I was their savior. Accordingly, they rewarded me hundreds of dollars for minutes of manual labor. While this is all great and all, their cash will not be the source of your wealth \u2014 it won\u2019t be what you are looking for in the end.\n\nYou will travel for years and years, but if your journey is anything like mine, you won\u2019t realize the source of my new found wealth until the latter years. You will come to see that it was the entrepreneurial sense your neighbors gave you \u2014 the gift of intelligence. You will become rich beyond your wildest dreams. One day, you will take a look back at all those years you spent exploring what had always been right there in front of you and see that they were making an entrepreneur out of you.\n\nStep in a business class, forum, meeting, or gathering of any sort and ask the question, \u201cwhat is the most important rule of thumb in business,\u201d and a perfectly synced chant of \u201cLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\u201d will return. They are not wrong but they are missing the biggest component: demand. Location means nothing when there is no demand\u2026 Not convinced? Try to start a business in the heart of New York City and let me know how that goes.\n\nMy location was great for earning money and the people needed my help. I went down the same road for years. It was as if I was in a simulation, like the one the prominent scientists today are suggesting we are all a part of. Ever written code? There\u2019s a loop command in many programming languages which simply iterates through more commands to execute specific actions. As the snow covered the town and families retreated to their fireplace, I looped through the streets of Swarthmore as follows (written in loop form for my fellow programmers\u263a):\n\nThat simply says: trudge through the entirety of Swarthmore until you\u2019ve gone by each home; knock on each home and if they answer, offer to shovel their sidewalks, driveway and cars. If they accept, do it and collect your reward. However, If they don\u2019t answer, go to the next home and repeat until there are no more homes in Swarthmore.\n\nSo I had the same route year after year. I would hit the same houses each time I looped through the town. They loved to see me at the break of dawn to shovel their snow. I was really taking a load off their backs, but it turns out that by the sixth year, I was breaking their banks as well.\n\nNow in 2009, I was $2400 richer. I\u2019ve never been fond of spending money, so I saved most of it. This year, I woke up a bit later than usual and continued on my journey through Swarthmore.\n\nAs I did, you will learn that if you sleep in, you might start losing ground to machines. The first block of my journey had outsourced my job to machines. It would not be wise to try to blame the employer for this. Everyone has an agenda where making and keeping money are usually at the top as they probably are at yours, too. With that said, ditch the finger pointing and adjust to the situation.\n\nPresent your once loyal customers with something their robotic servants can\u2019t. This will be the only way to win over your customers from the competition: those darn red snow blowing machines had not seen the last of me.\n\nIn 2010, my journey continued. Now smarter and stronger than before, I had something new to present to my customers. I had something the robots didn\u2019t: hands. My hands could hold more than a shovel, so I equipped a salt bag, a strong snow blower (yeah, if you can\u2019t beat them, join them) and my companion, Mr. Shovel.\n\nNow you\u2019re not just shoveling their property, you are doing it faster, better, and you are also preventing more snow from accumulating. You could even start to shovel pathways to areas of their property they\u2019d like to have access to without even being asked to. Do this all at little to no extra charge.\n\nI was now able to cover more ground in a quicker time and with better quality services. Yes quality; if you take nothing else from this story, make sure you understand that the quality of your service is worth much more than the quantity of services you provide.\n\nNow when you go to collect your reward, your customers will be more joyful than in years past. They will appreciate the extra effort you volutarily put in \u2014 some may even tip you 50% like one of my customers once did. I used to think it was some sort of magic, but as you grow in business, you\u2019ll learn that its simple logic: give more \u2192 get more.\n\nOver my decade long journey through Swarthmore, I made many mistakes that I can\u2019t take back. In fact, I don\u2019t want any of them back. If Confucius is right in saying reflection is the noblestmeans of learning wisdom, in reminiscing of your journey, you will see that your mistakes served you well. My biggest mistake was getting greedy at the end of my days, so I started squeezing my customers for more money. Subsequently, I got no money from them.\n\nCustomer-empathy has been proven very effective in marketing, and building a successful business. You\u2019ve been practicing this for as long as I can remember. When your friend asks you to perform a task for them, they trust you to get the job done timely and efficiently. They will keep coming back to you as long as this trust stays true. Your customers are no different.\n\nHowever, you can\u2019t befriend every customer, they have to be open and willing to be your friend back. For that reason, whenever I got the opportunity to befriend a customer, I jumped on it. Part of being a good friend is doing right by your friend. Again, your customers are no different. Listen to your customers. When they feel there is more that needs to be done, fulfill that demand. Along the way, we chatted a bit; we exchanged names, education history, personal interests, and most times, contact info.\n\nNow that you are friends, you both understand the other\u2019s motives. You understand that your customer needs his driveway cleared of snow to get to work, your customer knows you need money to live, and you trust one another to help the other reach their goal. This is the power of catering to and befriending your customers. Your following on Twitter, one of the greatest marketing tools in this age, will grow almost uncontrollably.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Google is consecutively the best company to work for in America.\n\nAn elderly lady named Nancy Dellmuth was a common stop for me on my trip through Swarthmore. This year was the coldest its been in a decade. I was ready to quit and head back home to mommy, but I pushed through because Nancy counted on me to come every year. Realizing I was a bit debilitated by the cold, she invited me inside to warm up before I got to clearing her driveway.\n\nBecause she treated me so well and cared about me, I felt I needed to do more for her than she asked me to. After doing all the things she requested, I decided I would go further and create a path to her shed just in case she needed to get to it for any reason.\n\nAll through your journey, you will receive words that either pave the way to your next step or adjust your path.\n\nThe more I grew up, the more I was given words of motivation, inspiration, and acceptance for my perseverance. These people\u2019s words kept me going and often changed the direction in which I would proceed.\n\nThat\u2019s what an entrepreneur needs: a dream, a will, and some support. Likewise, an entrepreneur should be able to inspire others just as he/she has been.\n\nIn return, they may just share your words with another person or two, and before you know it, you\u2019ll have a new following. As an entrepreneur, your words carry greater weight so make them worth something.\n\nWhat if I told you that you were going to fail more times than you can count, and perhaps never achieve what you purported to? Would you advance or retreat?\n\nSometimes, you will fail because it just won\u2019t be the right time, rarely because you are late, other times because the other person doesn\u2019t like your face, and the remaining times may be because you give up right before you reach the diamonds.\n\nThe danger of failing is simply not succeeding in that moment, but the opportunity that results may be a new, perhaps better, way of going about achieving that goal. When I failed, which you probably will many times, I had done so for one reason or another. Faulty parts won\u2019t always be apparent, but once they are, you need to fix the problem and continue on your way. Don\u2019t retreat.\n\nIt\u2019s too beautiful a gift we have been given, but life could be better. That\u2019s what you are here for. You need to make this life better. Increase the quality of life. The mission of an entrepreneur is to find a new solution to something and ultimately capitalize on it. We all want to make money, but we first have to create value.\n\nAs I journeyed through Swarthmore for all those years learning all these lessons, I didn\u2019t realize until now that I was learning how to be a better entrepreneur.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want to do, and if you are an entrepreneur, this should not be too far off from your goal: innovate and create value.\n\nThis quote shared by @lumi-nation really inspired me to write this article:\n\nRead that quote a couple times before going on, it could change your life. That quote was the inspiration behind my newest business pursuit \u2014 the College Market, which I built during seven weeks of the summer of 2014. After breaking up with my girlfriend, I began my exploration of every language required in building a social network and effectively built the largest and only social marketplace for college students to buy and sell anything safely and locally.\n\nI have always believed that change is the product of discomfort and action. I have never liked the idea of buying from and selling to strangers who I don\u2019t have the least bit of preexisting connection with, so I decided to act and change it.\n\nAn entrepreneur needs to always be thinking of bettering everything.What will be ideal for the customer? How could you take a bulky phone case that obstructs the functionality of the phone and make it better without sacrificing protection? Then you validate your ideal solution with reasoning. Well since all you need are bumpers on the corners of a phone, a back plate to keep the back of it safe, and a screen protector for its display, there\u2019s no reason to wrap it in three layers of plastic and rubber.\n\nFinally, draw up the concept, name it, and explain how it works to everyone you know. Voila, you\u2019ve solved an issue, created value, possibly shaken an industry, and excited consumers.\n\nYour journey has been long, but it has been filled with lessons you might have never learned without such an endeavor.\n\nWhat will you do when the robots come: you could be at risk of losing your role/business to machines, what are you going to do about it?\n\nI will leave you with the signature on every email I send:"

        "title": "How bitcoin makes transactions cheaper \u2013 AirTree Ventures \u2013",
        "text": "There are many reasons to be excited about bitcoin: it could enable totally new business and technology models; it resembles the internet in the early \u201890s in the sense that it is a network that no-one owns and everyone can contribute to; it could revolutionise legal concepts of ownership; it could disrupt the payments industry; it could even become a tax haven. It could also flop.\n\nIn an earlier post, I described the thinking behind my first angel investment in the digital currency space: CoinDesk. In this post, I discuss what first got me excited about bitcoin \u2014 the solution to the so-called \u201cdouble spending problem\u201d \u2014 and why this could drastically reduce the cost of non-cash transactions.\n\nThe double spending problem: why it costs so much to transact electronically\n\nThe double spending problem is the risk that a person could pay for two different things with the same unit of currency. This problem really only arises if you want to make a purchase electronically (i.e. with something other than cash).\n\nSay I make t-shirts and you want to buy one. In the offline world, we could transact with cash. You give me a $20 bill, and I give you a t-shirt. As I\u2019m now in physical possession of the $20 bill, I can be certain that you won\u2019t spend it on something else. My only risk is that you\u2019re a professional counterfeiter, but that\u2019s pretty unlikely\u2026\n\nNow, say you want to buy one of the t-shirts from my online e-store. As it happens, my shop is overseas. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we could replicate the offline experience by you simply sending me a digital version of a $20 bill? Until recently you couldn\u2019t: you needed at least one financial institution involved and either you or I (or both of us) had to pay them a fee to facilitate things. A credit card payment is a good example. You would send me your card details and, in order to process it, I would involve the credit card provider, a merchant services company and my bank.\n\nWe needed the financial institutions because, unlike physical bills, digital information is super easy to copy. If you try to send me a unit of digital money directly, how can I know that it is real \u2014 or that you haven\u2019t sent the same thing to someone else? To be certain, I\u2019d need to access your bank account to check that your balance actually decreased. And there\u2019s no way you\u2019d give access to your bank account to someone selling you a t-shirt!\n\nThe role financial institutions play here is to serve as a trusted third party to identify you and me, to ensure that the money is spent only once, and to process the payment. In order to retain their trusted status, financial institutions also become involved if there is a dispute between us.\n\nThis takes time and resources, for which financial institutions charge fees. In the example of the t-shirt sale, I (the merchant) would incur a cost of 0.5-2.5% to process the credit card. You (the purchaser) would probably be charged a currency conversion fee by your credit card provider (who would no doubt make additional money by giving you a crappy exchange rate).\n\nThese fees and charges add up. Some smart management consultants I used to work with estimated that transaction-specific fees amounted to nearly $140 billion in 2012.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fundamental innovation is to obviate the need for a 3rd party to be involved in the transaction. It allows you to securely and anonymously transfer money to anyone, anywhere in the world. Going back to the t-shirt example: if you had paid me in bitcoin, I would have paid much much less than the c. 2.5% it cost me to process your credit card. And you would have paid no currency conversion fee whatsoever.\n\nHow does bitcoin deal with the double spending problem?\n\nI can sense your skepticism. How does bitcoin cut out the financial middlemen?\n\nBitcoin is a \u201cpurely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d. It allows you to securely send money directly to me. The bitcoin network is decentralised, which means there is no central financial body overseeing things. That sounds bad, right? Well, actually no \u2014 bitcoin\u2019s inventor developed a clever mechanism to ensure that bitcoins couldn\u2019t be copied and spent more than once.\n\nEach bitcoin has a history attached to it \u2014 essentially a log of digital signatures showing the transactions it has been involved in. In bitcoin-speak, these logs are called \u2018blocks\u2019 and, when you put them all together, they form the \u2018blockchain\u2019. The blockchain contains a record of all the transactions ever made using bitcoin.\n\nBut what if someone alters a block? Couldn\u2019t they \u2018erase\u2019 a transaction and spend a coin twice?\n\nThe nifty thing about bitcoin is that the blockchain is publicly available. Anyone on the internet can see it (don\u2019t worry \u2014 the names of the parties to specific transactions remain hidden). There is a huge amount of computer power that goes into recording transactions and verifying the blockchain. This is what all the computers mining bitcoins around the world are doing and its why bitcoin transactions take an average of 10 minutes to complete. (To incentivise miners to undertake this work, they can \u2018earn\u2019 bitcoins along the way \u2014 but mining is a story for another post...) If someone were to alter a block, all the other computers on the bitcoin network would notice it and \u2018vote\u2019 to reject that alteration.\n\nIn short, in order to hack the system and spend a coin twice, you\u2019d need more computer power than everyone else on the whole bitcoin network combined. And that\u2019s virtually impossible nowadays."

        "text": "Does social media actually work? The answer depends on what you consider social media\u2019s job (besides making money) is. For me, one important job for social media is helping people stay connected with their friends. And yes, social media does that job quite well.\n\nThe most basic action that you might take on almost all kinds of social media is posting. You go on social sites to post things, things about yourself. They can be words, photos, videos, or links \u2014 all kinds of stuff. What you post keeps friend updated about you, the current you. Via social media, your friends get to know about your new haircut, your new baby dog, the crazy party that you went to last Friday night, the song that you are insane about recently, the new movie that you went to theatre for and considered a total waste of two hours, and the Europe traveling you are planning on\u2026\n\nBut why is it so important to tell your friends something about you? Or why would they give a heck about my crap, you might ask. They will, because they are your friends and they do give a heck about you. You meet friends in different life stages \u2014 high school, college, different jobs, and so on. But you and some of yours friend might be lack of topics to talk about after a while not seeing each other, and gradually you are less of friends. You don\u2019t want this to happen; you try to make things like you were still living together (just like in school). So you call your friends, text them, and email them. But still, gradually, you don\u2019t know what to call about, to text about, or to email about. Soon, you know less and less about your friends, and so do them. Sure you can just let things go and maybe cut these friends out eventually. But what if you don\u2019t want to? What if some of them you treasure too much to lose? And of course there are some. That\u2019s why you were trying to do all those calling, texting, and emailing in the first place. As you can see, keeping your friends informed via call, text, or email is something really hard (and almost impossible) to do in the long run. You need to know your friends enough to keep those phone calls going. But you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t know what happened to them recently. Social media helps solve this problem (not entirely, but still).\n\nBesides, traditional methods require you and your friends to be involved at the same time. However, your friends don\u2019t usually have free time when you want to call them. Social media, on the other hand, can be used by you and your friends at different time. You post a photo of your new baby dog while you\u2019re walking him in the sunset, and your friends can see it and maybe reply to (or comment on) during their tea break the next day. To some degree, traditional methods are instant while social media is idle.\n\nPeople used to lose friends because of losing connections. But with the development of modern technology, what happened doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen again."

It\u2019s about the challenge of solving a problem, something that doesn\u2019t quite work or just feels \u2018wrong\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s about loving that challenge. The bigger, the better. It\u2019s a quite common perception that a designer\u2019s work is all about how it looks, if the colour scheme matches your preferences or the typeface is your favourite.\n\nBut good design is selfless. It\u2019s aimed for the good and needs of others.\n\nIt\u2019s about communication. Sending a message and establishing a connection. One that goes directly to your brain, to trigger some kind of emotion that ultimately will lead you to do something.\n\nIt\u2019s about research. Understanding your audience and reaching out to them, in a language they comprehend and to say something they want to hear.\n\nIt\u2019s about purpose. Good design is intentional, in every step of the way. There are no random decisions and \u201cBecause it looks cool!\u201d is not an acceptable argument.\n\nIf you focus all your efforts on making \u2018pixel-perfect\u2019 design, creating an awesome gradient on some button or grasping the perfect texture for your background, you\u2019re shortsighted.\n\nYou\u2019re not solving the problem, just putting a whole lot of make-up on top of it. It still won\u2019t work. It will still fail.\n\nAs designers, we must spend most of our time understanding the problem we\u2019re aiming to solve. We must follow the footsteps of those who we\u2019re solving it for and walk on their shoes.\n\nDesign is not about mastering a tool, but about mastering people.\n\nYou can\u2019t say you\u2019ve succeeded in your design just because you got your client\u2019s money or a tap on the back from your boss. You should witness what your users are doing with your design, how they are using it and if it made their lives easier. If it empowered them. Your work doesn\u2019t end when it goes online as most of the learning will come from analysing the outcome of your solution.\n\nIt takes time to know if your design is successful because it needs to be tested in the real world, by real people, who will use it daily in order to achieve something.\n\nOnly then and only them can say if your design is good."

        "text": "The issue of responsive images dates back to over a decade ago, even before smartphones and tablets entered the market. After the dot com bubble burst of the early 2000's, resilient web developers picked themselves back up with the Web 2.0 movement, making images the most important part of web sites and applications. This rang especially true with the advent of hit counter graphics and Ajax \u2014 the use of spinner gifs to let a user know that something is happening behind the scenes.\n\nWith so many devices of different sizes and resolutions today, we developers are in dire need of a solution for loading responsive images without negatively affecting page load and speed. Fortunately, after much debate and deliberation between the W3C, Kodak, and popular browser vendors like Internet Explorer\u2019s Steve Ballmer, there is finally an adoptable solution to the responsive image problem. Ballmer unofficially called it the Ask-A-Cop concept.\n\nI\u2019ve done the hard work for you by implementing this concept. When you go to the page, you have to tell the site if you are on a mobile or desktop device. Depending on your response \u2014 and it\u2019s imperative and the law to give the right one \u2014 the correct image will show.\n\nHere is the source code [view source on Glitch], which uses two popular Web 2.0 concepts called \u201cswitch statements\u201d and \u201cjQuery\u201d to make sure the user tells the truth about the device form factor *and* that the browser holds its end of the bargain by returning the correct image.\n\nThe responsive image solution is something we developers have been craving for a long time, and it\u2019s nice to see that all the parties involved were able to come up with a solution that\u2019s both easy to develop and easy to understand from the user\u2019s perspective. We are finally coming close to the moment where we no longer need the W3C, as all the standards to standard will have been standarded."

I\u2019ve even recently done up an Open Information Pledge indicating so (which you can find a link to on my website\u2019s contact form even!).\n\nBut, what struck me strange about this, was that I would have to sign an NDA to work on open-source work all day long\u2026 I declined to proceed further, unless they adopted a pro-disclousure agreement instead, of which, they didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd that was that. Before I proceed further, it\u2019s important to say the interview experience was phenomal, they did an amazing job every step of the way, and I could not flaw them one bit. The recruiters, the interviewers, the team members I spoke to, everyone was amazing, incredibily facilating, and there is not a bad word to say, only good. Thank you everyone. This story is not about them, but about what I\u2019ve come to realise, which I\u2019ll detail now.\n\nSo ever after that experience\u2026 after having that question\u2026 \u201cwhy would I need to sign an NDA to work on open-source things?\u201d as well as my views on NDAs that I linked to earlier. I started wondering if I had misperceived Google, if my perception of them had been wrong. I started wondering what they\u2019re actually about.\n\nAre they a company that is trying to empower people, by creating amazing applications for them, amazing tools for developers, and amazing resources to get started with their eco-system? Most certainly they are that.\n\nAre they also something else? Here\u2019s where things get interesting.\n\nWith the shutdown of Google Reader, I was devastated. I wondered why they would kill such a thing. It reminded me of the neglect that Picasa got. And I still hear complaints from my mum about iGoogle being removed everytime I visit her. I started wondering, why some products get killed, even if they have a huge following like Reader. Well, because it doesn\u2019t align with their business model and strategy.\n\n> The way Google earns money is by providing adverts to you, the higher the conversion rate, the more money Google gets, the higher the conversation rate, the more information they need about you.\n\nSure that makes sense, that\u2019s expected. \u201cBut why kill Reader?!\u201d I hear you plead, \u201cthey could have used that to get information of articles you read to better serve you advertising?\u201d. Perhaps. But do they really need an application to do that in such an isolated use case, when they already have Google Chrome tracking everything you browse on the web, every website you visit, all the rest, for the majority of the connected world\u2019s population? With that in mind, Reader is small game for improving their business model returns.\n\nWhen you see Google through this lense, everything starts falling into place.\n\nGoogle is all about interfaces, all about interfaces that intercept your information.\n\nWhen you view Google this way, they really are the next Skynet\u2026 or maybe the next Matrix\u2026 or whatever you want to call it.\n\nWhat Google is really about, isn\u2019t so much about empowering people with free products and better tooling, but rather getting an interface into everywhere, to intercept everything, with the benefits of free and convenient products and tools.\n\nThe problem is, is that this is the best business model in the world, and it\u2019s terrifying\u2026\n\nWho doesn't want better tools for free that help them find what they want faster?\n\nUpdate: Aral Balkan has done a fantastic talk with RSA Animate about this very topic that is well worth watching. I\u2019ve also done a follow up of why exactly this situation concerns me, that is also well worth reading.\n\nCurious: These are alternatives that don\u2019t invade your privacy. I use DuckDuckGo for searching. Wire and Signal for messaging. Apple for most things, including email. And ProtonMail for super secure email."

        "text": "In the last year, one structure that has gained attention among the technology elite is Holacracy, which is a system of governance used at Medium and Zappos. Holacracy is a modified and evolved form of sociocracy that focuses on distributed authority through self-managing and self-sufficient teams known as circles. It focuses exclusively on governance, distributing authority to the working edges of the organization, and sensing and processing work-related issues as the organization evolves. The basic tenets of Holacracy are that authority should be distributed, everyone should be able to sense and process (solve) the tensions (ideas/problems) they perceive, roles and employees are not one-to-one, and that the organization can and should evolve toward its \u201crequisite structure\u201d (the ultimate structure for its current environment). Holacracy achieves these goals through meetings that are specially designed to turn ideas/problems into roles, accountabilities, and policies\u2014all of which promote \u201csafe to try\u201d next steps, projects, and actions. This is well summarized in the chart above as well as on the Holacracy One website. Holacracy\u2019s strength is that it works for any organization (not just an engineering culture), and it has a nice blend of rules/controls and emergence. Like Monopoly or any good game, Holacracy seems complex in theory but gets easier as you play.\n\nThe second framework worth exploring is a version of agile/lean development methodology that is being deployed at Spotify (among others). In a brief but savvy whitepaper written late last year, Henrik Kniberg and Anders Ivarsson share how Spotify thinks about roles and teams. Essentially, they have turned the matrix organization on its side (for an interesting detour into divisional vs. functional organizations check out Ben Thompson\u2019s post on Microsoft\u2019s re-org as well as his follow up piece). Instead of an engineering department, a design department, and a marketing department that each collaborate on products with dubious ownership, they organize vertically around products (or more specifically pieces of products) and traditional disciplines are loosely held horizontally. The main unit of organization in this model is called a \u201cSquad,\u201d or what Jeff Bezos might call a two pizza team. This small group (usually 7-10 people) is self-sufficient, multi-disciplinary, autonomous, and focused on a particular product, problem, or module (often with a core KPI or OKR). Think of it as a mini startup. Groups of Squads that are related through product or strategy are called \u201cTribes.\u201d Groups of people who practice the same discipline (design, UX, development) organize and collaborate as \u201cChapters,\u201d and communities of interest that aren\u2019t specific to a Chapter (like QA or Agile) are called \u201cGuilds.\u201d The squad model\u2019s strength is that it allows one person to be a member of several different groups with completely different functions, while not losing sight of the most important thing (the user/product). What makes it flexible is squads are formed, grown, and divided or dispersed with little fanfare as the business evolves. There is much to grok here\u2014for further information on how Spotify builds products, I recommend this paper.\n\nOur third framework is something we refer to as Self Organizing or Open Allocation. Two companies leading this charge are Valve and GitHub. Like the examples above, these companies seek to create a structure that will evolve over time and put authority and trust in the hands of their talented employees. Unlike the examples above, they accomplish this by essentially having no structure. Employees are encouraged to work on whatever they want \u2014 to find the projects that engage them and do the best work of their lives. Valve has codified this approach in their somewhat internet-famous employee handbook. GitHub exposed their Open Allocation approach in a more recent piece on fastcolabs.com. This approach is not without its perils. To be done well, it requires extremely high talent density (so that you trust people to make all their own decisions) and a tightly-knit culture of communication (so that everyone knows what the hell is going on). Certain cultural norms about performance and unspoken power structures (something Holacracy addresses head on) almost certainly play a role here, for good or bad. While this concept may be more of an ideal than a practical reality, these firms (and others like them) are actively scaling it and testing its mettle, with astoundingly good results.\n\nThe defining characteristics of these models are fairly straightforward. They aim to distribute authority and autonomy to individuals and teams. They let the changing nature of the work (expansion/contraction/shifting) impact the structure of roles and teams in a fluid way. They try to make the implicit explicit and prize transparent communication. They allow individuals to gather and work as members of multiple groups with multiple contexts and they go far beyond the disingenuous \u201cdotted line\u201d nonsense of the traditional corporation. They minimize the role of management to systems-level issues and strategies that can only be solved with a bird\u2019s eye view, pushing everything else to the edge. And they organize the work, the teams, and the individuals around a purpose \u2014 unpacked for each context. If these themes sound familiar, that\u2019s because they\u2019re the traits associated with workplaces that create intrinsic motivation (remember Dan Pink\u2019s autonomy, mastery, and purpose?). Think of them like a first principles approach to organization design."

        "title": "Superhuman Cognitive Stamina \u2013",
        "text": "People have a daily cognitive stamina that represents their ability to do any intellectual work.\n\nEvery decision, big or small, every moment of mental focus, and every act of comprehension is part of your day\u2019s cognitive stamina. Let\u2019s call that your cognitive budget.\n\nWhen your stamina is drained, you revert to your lazy self, choosing actions which are habitual, familiar and routine. Your stamina recharges completely overnight (and gets a partial refill after every meal).\n\nColloquially, people are most likely to think of this as willpower. Although scientists are most likely to refer to this as decision fatigue (this NY Times article is a great primer on the subject).\n\nThe application of this concept is now my default philosophy on behavior design (more important than even BJ Fogg\u2019s BMAT). Many people wish they could improve their cognitive stamina (you can, with training), but there\u2019s a much cheaper and immediate approach: efficient allocation of your cognitive budget.\n\nBelow is how this can change your life.\n\nThe key to the useful application of cognitive stamina is to think in terms of a cognitive budget.\n\nAt the Neuroleadership Conference I answered the question of, \u201cWhat are habits of effective leaders?\u201d by telling an anecdote about Steve Jobs and his black turtleneck. Every morning, he would pick a black turtleneck from the top of a pile of black turtlenecks. This act has a cognitive load of zero. It\u2019s habitual and requires no decision making.\n\nThis morning, I chose my shirt from among fifty different options including t-shirts and dress shirts, taking into account the weather and who I was going to be spending time with. Just by the time I\u2019m dressed, my cognitive budget has been depleted by ten decisions because no part of my dressing routine is habitualized. Steve Jobs would leave for work with ten more decisions in his cognitive budget than I do. [Note: after writing this, I obviously reorganized my morning routine.]\n\nThe habits of effective leaders, then, are any habits. Any habit you build reduces your daily cognitive load, giving you more budget to spend elsewhere. (Of course, this is based on the idea that the highest achievers are channeling most of their cognitive budget toward their primary goal. That\u2019s definitely true for me.)\n\nThrough Coach.me, we get to see a community of people tackling millions of goals. Many of the goals people pursue on our platform come down to building habits.\n\nEach successful habit has the effect of saving cognitive budget for other parts of a person\u2019s life. This is because a habit is something that doesn\u2019t drain your cognitive budget (they are behaviors that originate in a different part of the brain). So any time we convert a habit from goal to routine, we\u2019ve reduced a person\u2019s daily cognitive load.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t know what to do, you have to spend a lot of your cognitive budget figuring it out. Habit seekers get an immediate benefit from their first few attempts just by answering basic questions of skill.\n\nFor example, the new flosser learns where the floss is, how much floss they should pull out, and how to wrap the floss around their fingers. Obviously, these seem like trivial skills, \u201cmicro skills\u201d if you will.\n\nBut in learning these micro skills, the cognitive drain for the next flossing attempt is much lower.\n\nCoaches have a huge impact on reducing the cognitive load of a goal, either by creating explicit training plans or by asking their clients enough questions that the client creates an implicit plan.\n\nWith a training plan, a coach can tell you exactly what to do, i.e. run 3 miles today. A good training plan has the effect of reducing the cognitive load of a new goal because you have to do less thinking.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with personal coaching. Good coaches ask a lot of questions (and good clients answer them). The effect of this is that clients plan their behavior ahead of time (a small investment) rather than negotiate their behavior in the moment (often a messy proposition).\n\nWhat the concepts of cognitive load and of cognitive budget tell us is the value of constraint. Not every aspect of your life has to be filled with options.\n\nThinking this way lets you decide where your mental energy goes. Hopefully not toward your choice of socks."

        "title": "F\u2019d: How the U.S. and Its Allies Got Stuck with the World\u2019s Worst New Warplane",
        "text": "Where the Harrier has its rotating engine nozzles for downward thrust, the F-35 has a new kind of vertical-lift system combining a hinged main engine nozzle at the back of the plane that points directly backward until the pilot shifts into hover mode, at which point the nozzle swivels 90 degrees to point down.\n\nSimultaneously, a complicated system of shafts, gears and doors activates to reveal the horizontal lift fan installed in the center of the aircraft just behind the cockpit. Together the fan and nozzle produce more than 40,000 pounds of thrust, enough to lift the nearly 20-ton aircraft straight up off the ground like a gargantuan dragonfly.\n\nThe lift fan, devised by Lockheed and DARPA in the early 1980s, was the only workable solution that anyone had come up with to give a plane vertical capability plus supersonic speed and radar-evading stealth, the last of which demands an airplane with a smooth outline and nothing hanging or protruding from it.\n\nBut this mix of characteristics came at a price to all three F-35 models, even the two that don\u2019t need to take off vertically. \u201cThe STOVL requirements have dictated most if not all of the cardinal design elements for all three aircraft,\u201d said Peter Goon, an analyst with the Air Power Australia think tank.\n\nThe addition of a lift fan to the baseline F-35 design started a cascade of problems that made it heavier, slower, more complex, more expensive and more vulnerable to enemy attack \u2014 problems that were evident in the 2008 war game set over Taiwan.\n\nOf course Lockheed exec O\u2019Bryan rejected that assessment, claiming the JSF\u2019s stealth, sensors and aerodynamics make it superior to other planes. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he insisted.\n\nBut in many ways the JSF did become rocket science as it grew more complex. The original X-35 from 2001 had the advantage of being strictly a test plane with no need to carry weapons. But the frontline F-35 needs weapons. And to maintain the smooth shape that\u2019s best for avoiding detection by radar, the weapons need to be carried inside internal bomb bays. Bomb bays would normally go along an airplane\u2019s centerline, but the F-35's center is reserved for the 50-inch-diameter lift fan. Hence Sprey\u2019s claim that STOVL and stealth are incompatible.\n\nTo keep down costs all three JSF variants \u2014 the Air Force\u2019s basic F-35A, the Marines\u2019 vertical-takeoff F-35B and the Navy F-35C with a bigger wing for at-sea carrier landings \u2014 share essentially the same fuselage. And to fit both the F-35B\u2019s lift fan and the bomb bays present in all three models, the \u201ccross-sectional area\u201d of the fuselage has to be \u201cquite a bit bigger than the airplanes we\u2019re replacing,\u201d conceded Lockheed exec Tom Burbage, who retired this year as head of the company\u2019s F-35 efforts.\n\nThe extra width violates an important aerospace design principle called the \u201carea rule,\u201d which encourages narrow, cylindrical fuselages for best aerodynamic results. The absence of area rule on the F-35 \u2014 again, a knock-on effect of the Marines\u2019 demand for a lift fan \u2014 increases drag and consequently decreases acceleration, fuel efficiency and flying range. Thus critics\u2019 assertion that supersonic speed can\u2019t be combined with STOVL and stealth, the latter of which are already incompatible with each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the laws of physics,\u201d Burbage said in his company\u2019s defense when word got out about the JSF\u2019s performance downgrades.\n\nBut the hits kept coming, chipping away at the F-35's ability to fight. The addition of the lift fan forces the new plane to have just one rearward engine instead of two carried by many other fighters. (Two engines is safer.) The bulky lift fan, fitted into the fuselage just behind the pilot, blocks the rear view from the cockpit \u2014 a shortcoming that one F-35 test pilot said would get the new plane \u201cgunned every time.\u201d That is, shot down in any aerial dogfight by enemy fighters you can\u2019t see behind you.\n\nO\u2019Bryan said the JSF\u2019s sensors, including fuselage-mounted video cameras that scan 360 degrees around the plane, more than compensate for the limited rearward view. Critics countered that the video resolution is far worse than the naked eye and completely inadequate for picking up the distant, tiny, minimal contrast dots in the sky that represent deadly fighter threats ready to kill you.\n\nBut there are plenty of other problems with the F-35 \u2014 some related the airplane\u2019s layout, some stemming from inexperienced subcontractors and still others resulting from poor oversight by a succession of short-tenure government managers whose major contributions were to grow the bureaucracy involved in the F-35's development.\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-117 stealth fighter was developed in a breakneck 30 months by a close-knit team of 50 engineers led by an experienced fighter designer named Alan Brown and overseen by seven government employees. Brown said he exercised strict control over the design effort, nixing any proposed feature of the plane that might add cost or delay or detract from its main mission.\n\nThe F-35, by contrast, is being designed by some 6,000 engineers led by a rotating contingent of short-tenure managers, with no fewer than 2,000 government workers providing oversight. The sprawling JSF staff, partially a product of the design\u2019s complexity, has also added to that complexity like a bureaucratic feedback loop, as every engineer or manager scrambles to add his or her specialty widget, subsystem or specification to the plane\u2019s already complicated blueprints \u2026 and inexperienced leaders allow it.\n\n\u201cThe F-35 \u2014 that whole thing has gotten away from us as a country,\u201d lamented Brown, now retired.\n\nMany of the JSF\u2019s problems converged in 2004, when Lockheed was forced to admit that the Marines\u2019 F-35B variant was greatly overweight, owing in part to the addition of the lift fan. Ironically, the fan and other vertical-launch gear threatened to make the new plane too heavy to take off vertically.\n\n\u201cThe short takeoff/vertical landing variant would need to lose as much as 3,000 pounds to meet performance requirements,\u201d Lockheed manager Robert Elrod revealed in an annual report. Panicked, Lockheed poured more people, time and money (billed to the government) into a redesign effort that eventually shaved off much of the extra weight \u2014 basically by removing safety gear and making fuselage parts thinner and less tough.\n\nO\u2019Bryan said the weight reduction ultimately benefited all three F-35 variants. But the redesigned JSF, while somewhat lighter and more maneuverable, is also less durable and less safe to fly. In particular, the elimination of 11 pounds\u2019 worth of valves and fuses made the JSF 25-percent more likely to destroyed when struck by enemy fire , according to Pentagon analysis.\n\nProblems multiplied. Originally meant to cost around $200 billion to develop and buy nearly 2,900 planes expected to make their combat debut as early as 2010, the F-35's price steadily rose and its entry into service repeatedly slipped to the right. Today the cost to develop and manufacture 2,500 of the new planes \u2014 a 400-jet reduction \u2014 has ballooned to nearly $400 billion, plus another trillion dollars to maintain over five decades of use.\n\nTo help pay for the overruns, between 2007 and 2012 the Pentagon decommissioned nearly 500 existing A-10s, F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18s \u2014 15 percent of the jet fighter fleet \u2014 before any F-35s were ready to replace them. The first, bare-bones F-35s with half-complete software and only a few compatible weapons aren\u2019t scheduled to make their combat debut until late 2015, the same year that Boeing is slated to stop making the 1990s-vintage F/A-18E/F, the only other in-production jet fighter being acquired by the Pentagon. (F-15s and F-16s are still being manufactured for foreign customers by Boeing and Lockheed, respectively.)\n\nAt the moment the first operational F-35 finally flies its first real-world sortie two years from now, it may truly represent an aerospace monopoly \u2014 that is, unless additional orders from the U.S. or abroad extend the F-15, F-16 or F/A-18 assembly lines. The JSF could be openly acknowledged as the worst fighter in the world and, in the worst case, still be the only new fighter available for purchase by the U.S. military.\n\nInstead of revitalizing the Pentagon\u2019s air arsenal as intended, the JSF is eating it \u2014 and putting future war strategy at risk. In 2012 an embarrassed Frank Kendall, the Pentagon\u2019s chief weapons buyer, called the F-35 \u201cacquisitions malpractice.\u201d\n\nBut Kendall was referring only to the new plane\u2019s delays and cost increases. He didn\u2019t mention the more deadly flaw that had been revealed in Stillion and Perdue\u2019s 2008 air-war simulation: that regardless of when and at what price the F-35 enters service, owing to its vertical-takeoff equipment the new fighter is the aerodynamic equivalent of a lobbed brick, totally outclassed by the latest Russian- and Chinese-made jets.\n\nTo add insult to strategic injury, one of the most modern Chinese prototype warplanes might actually be an illicit near-copy of the F-35 \u2014 albeit a more intelligent copy that wisely omits the most compromising aspects of the U.S. plane. It\u2019s possible that in some future war, America\u2019s JSFs could be shot down by faster, deadlier, Chinese-made JSF clones."
