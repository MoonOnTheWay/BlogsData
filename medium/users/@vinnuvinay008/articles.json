        "title": "THE SEARCH FOR MACHINE INTELLIGENCE \u2014 Notes of an inquirer.",
        "text": "We have learned very little about our brains.May be like all complex systems we will one day figure out it\u2019s working \u2014from how we form opinions to our ability to be self-aware.I agree that it is genuinely puzzling how interactions within a 3 pound matter can produce theories of cosmos,be self aware and even speculate on it\u2019s origins.But so are the vast number of phenomenon in the universe \u2014 we have managed to understand and harness them to our benefit.Then question pertains \u2014 does the brain too operate on same physical laws.If that is the case then i would argue \u2014 we are very close in making our very own brain(maybe without some of it\u2019s glitches) \u2014 that would do all our inventions for us.If that needs us to extend physical laws \u2014 that\u2019s okay we would as long as those don\u2019t tells us of a master with a magic wand.\n\nHere i wouldn\u2019t try to predict the future after the advent of A.G.I \u2014 for i\u2019am convinced that it is very difficult if not impossible to think aftermath.I am not worried of A.G.I that would become self aware and crush it\u2019s creator \u2014 that would make a good hollywood drama.More benign way of dying would be \u2014 a human making a simple request like ensure my happiness at all times and the A.I eventually enlightened by a buddhist phrase \u2014 Life is suffering.Thus annihilated all life\u2026.I know my imaginations are poor but for a better appreciation of the existential threat we are facing read Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies-Nick Bostron.\n\nI initially set out to write a brief account explaining why acheiving general artifical intellingence is not far off \u2014 and may be in process convince the reader regarding the sensibility of the aspiration.I also planned to provide what i think of as the most direct way of achieving it.In the process i would evoke ideas from biology,physics,history,psychology and whatever else is needed \u2026..\n\nScience is a breathing book.We have been changing our notions of reality.All through our history our intuition about the workings of nature have been failing us.We are not the centre of the universe.We are not a separate creation from all the other animals.We are not here by any purpose.We are a phantom of chance.\n\nProbably the most striking lesson we have learned through science is that all the complex phenomenon we see can be accounted by surprisingly simple facts.Apparent complexity is the manifestation of long chains of simplicity.This shouldn\u2019t come by as surprise for in a perfectly godless world how can something complex exist without reducing into nothing.By nothing,i do not wish to avoke any enigma.We will try to peel down the layers of complexity,atleast to the point we can approach without mathematics.\n\nMost compelling explanations of the nature arises out of abstract concepts.Concepts like energy ,spacetime exist only in the realm of mathematics.It is better to try not to attribute too much meaning to them through our senses.Our intuition is the result of the mental models we carry about the world.Our limited capacities have rose to cater the needs of survival,not for deciphering the laws of nature.Our intuition of the world is based on our experience under small spectrum of the magnitudes.\n\nTake for example Mass.what\u2019s the minimum mass range that we could tell the difference?May be we could tell the difference between a gram and some fraction of it not of lower orders and similarly the upper limit may be between 100 and 1000 kilograms(don\u2019t ask me to device an experiment for that..).similarly we can establish limits to our perception of time(.1 to \u00b9\u2070\u2077) and length(.0004 to \u00b9\u2070\u2074).But universe operates on far grander scale.The mass of an electron is of the order of 10-\u00b3\u2070 while the upper limit is of mass of universe itself \u2014 is of the order \u00b9\u2070\u2075\u00b2(we have clever ways of estimating,but i suppose the details are not important here).Similarly the shortest length which we can estimate from three fundamental constants(planks constant,gravitational constant and the speed of light)turns out to be of the order 10-\u00b3\u2075 while upper limit \u00b9\u2070\u00b2\u2076 \u2014 radius of the universe.Now look at the difference in the orders of magnitude,in daily lives we only have interaction with 7 to 8 orders of magnitude while the nature operates on the orders of 60 to 80 times greater \u2014 these are only the minimum estimates.\n\nOver the years we have developed machinery to expand our reach but the most astounding of them all is mathematics.This is the language we evolved to grasp the operations of the universe.There is no reason for the intuition we developed for such short range of operation to continue for the microscopic world.Electrons behave as electrons not as particles or waves.What we call understanding should have nothing to do with intuition.Newtonian Mechanics which most of us find easier to comprehend is not at all intuitive.It took many years to figure out that when we push an object at rest we change it\u2019s velocity not it\u2019s position \u2014 which only changes as a consequence.\n\nSo it\u2019s important for us not to confuse facilitation with the actual understanding and the ability to make predictions.It\u2019s a wonder how facilitation under such short range of operation allowed us to develop mathematics and probe rest of the universe.\n\nFrom now on i will take you on a journey of exploration.Here and there we would derail from the main theme to explain certain scientific ideas that would help appreciate the material more deeply.\n\nWhat Evolution has to do with A.I.You are not in the wrong place.It\u2019s important to understand the underlying forces that led to us.\n\nHere i would try to impress upon you how complexity(we will try to define it in later sections,hold on to your intuition till then..) can emerge out of simplicity under suitable initial conditions when alloted sufficient time.We will understand evolution in all it\u2019s grandeur.\n\nWe will start by seeing how complex phenomenon can be explained by successively simpler rules.We carry our intuition of humans designing machines and wonder what except an omnipotent creator could design all this.\n\nIf anything in science that most shocks me than it is that we are mere survival machines geared towards successful transfer of genes.The Evolution by natural selection is not the most bizzare of ideas in science but it is the one that has attracted most contempt.Evolution of complexity of sorts not just biological doesn\u2019t require any intervention \u2014 no fine tuning of the laws,no vigilence of any intelligence.All complexity is manifestation of chains of simplicty.All processes are the play of atoms aimlessly roaming.The fate of these atoms which seem to be dependent on the precise attractive force between the neucleus and the electrons (this force being very gentle is the cause of all the complexity of the universe , unlike forces within nucleus which are much stronger but shorter in range these forces are perfect for the occurance of reactions or the transformations that eventually lead to us)are infact modulated by a tendency towards chaos.\n\nThe forces inside the atom are of two kinds \u2014 those between the nucleus and the electrons and those that hold the nucleus together.The former force is governed by a constant(approximately equal to 1/137) that determines the size of an atom.This has far reaching consequences.If that constant had been twice as big we would be half our size and have taken \u00b9\u2070\u2076\u2074 years to evolve.(Age of our universe is \u00b9\u2070\u00b9\u2070 years).Forces within the nucleus must be very strong as it is very densely packed \u2014 If a human were a nucleus electrons would be roaming 100kms away.These forces are again only operational within the nucleus \u2014 If they could also influence electrons then there wouldn\u2019t be any reactions and thus all change halts.\n\nIn all the processes all that we see is chemical reactions \u2014 mysterious blobs of matter coming together under the settings of the right environment .These blobs are made up of atoms whose nature allows them to form close groups \u2014 molecules.When these molecules are set in warm liquids and allowed sufficient time \u2014 they tend to form bigger and more complex molecules.Under the pressure of dispersal,molecules stumbled upon reproduction.Some of them were able to produce their replicas under the conditions of the environment.Now change addition to neighbouring molecules added to the diversity of the produced children.Those that are more fit at replicating gave rise to apes and thinking machines.\n\nBut ,what drives these changes ? All changes are observed to increase the entropy of the universe.This refers to all forms of change from planetary motion to the formation of perception.There seems to be a physical quantity that always increases with time.A slightly different phrasing might gives us a different expectation \u2014 all processes are directed towards increase of entropy.The second statement seems to indicate some cause that is increasing this physical quantity otherwise how can something increase out of nothing.This has raised entropy to an enigmatic stature \u2014 seemingly educated people making weird statements.\n\nInfact it turns out that law of increasing entropy is not even a law \u2014 in that it imposes no constraints.\n\nConsider 10 coins arranged in a row.Now you are tasked to randomly select one of the coin and toss it.You are trying to keep track of the number of heads in the experiment.Now let\u2019s assume initial configuration started with all tails.Now as you proceed through the experiment on average system will evolve towards increasing number of heads.As all the events are purely random,let\u2019s assume on trail 1 you got heads.Now we have 9 tails and one heads.In the next trail you are more likely to choose to toss one of the tails than the only head.Irrespective of the outcome of this trail \u2014 head or tail ,total number of heads in the system would either increase or remain same.\n\nNow consider the situation when you have 5 heads and 5 tails.Any further trail ,on average cannot change the count.When the number of coins increases \u2014 to the proportion of number of gas molecules in a room this nature will become increasingly evident.Irrespective of the initial configuration,system will evolve to ultimate chaos when not restricted.\n\nEnergy \u2014 an abstract concept that we associate with the capacity to do work varies in quality.Energy can be in various forms \u2014 from gravitational to thermal.When you take a room full of gas to describe it\u2019s state(i.e the position and velocity of each molecule) we need vast amount of information.So we contend ourselves with average values like temperature.When we measure temperature of an object we have very little information of their actual state.Whereas consider a body raised above ground.The gravitational energy associated with it is same for all molecules.This is said to be of high quality.This tendency of energy to move from high quality to low quality \u2014 is captured in the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the law of increasing entropy.\n\nBut we can see how non-intervention and letting the system behave randomly can give rise to a fundamental law of the universe.The nature of the universe is inherently purposeless and needs no explanation.\n\nBut,our experience with other physical laws tells us that they are after all some constraints in behaviour \u2014 from newton\u2019s laws of motion to Maxwell\u2019s equations of electromagnetism.As our understanding is deepening we began to find much simpler explanations to these phenomenon.With the formulation of Einstein\u2019s General theory of Relativity and formation of Quantum mechanics we began to see extraordinary simplicity in the workings of nature.It seems universe operates under no constraints at all.We learned that particles are waves and gravity is nothing but warped space-time.(2)Our notions of space and time reduced to one,so are of particle and wave.\n\nLet\u2019s return back to entropy.Universe is drowning in chaos.Emergence of local order must inevitably creates chaos somewhere.Then what is stopping the collapse of energy \u2014 keeping it from flowing too fast.When we look around us there seems to be no where else in the universe that a life form controls the direction of flow of energy except on our planet.Rest everywhere universe seems to be mindlessly burning energy but it is all backed by a motiveless disintegration into chaos.Life and the apparent orderliness is afterall a brief trap before energy falls down the chain into more chaos.Gravitational energy has the highest quality.It protects us from the collapse.Freeman dyson \u2014 mathematician and physicist in Energy in the universe talks about other hangups that slows down this flow of energy.Other wise we should have been incinerated by now.It\u2019s likely that ours is the only universe that survived to ponder about it\u2019s existence.\n\nEven if we reduce all the complexity to a few basic phenomenon even them we seem to be left out with the task of precisely defining some forces and some fundamental particles whatever they turn out to be.\n\nThings behave and rules are our commentary on their behaviour.\n\nNow we have established all change as motiveless degradation of quality of energy.Now we will displace all the laws of universe.Things have their innate nature and their behaviour is in accord with their nature.We will see how laws are mere emergent illusion when the fundamental particles are let loose without any restrictions.Our perception and ultimately all our investigation is enabled by the fact that we can sense the world \u2014 see and feel.It all starts with light.We would Observe it\u2019s behaviour and try to infer it\u2019s nature.Than we can discard all rules.\n\nWe are taught light travels in straight lines and that they only bend at the interface of the separating media.This seems to be the rule that light follows,which is different from how other waves like sound travel.It\u2019s also observed that speed of light is controlled by the medium of travel .Now, as it turned out this makes light bend at the interface of the media.Why does it do so ?\n\nA simple idea explains it elegantly \u2014 of all possible routes ,light travels in a path that takes least time.Similar rule \u2014 law of least action can be attributed to the motion of particles under force.\n\nLet me consider two arbitrary points(a ,b)on the either sides of two media A and B stacked on top of each other.If a light ray from a has to reach b it can choose to cover some distance in media A and some distance in media B.We can imagine some optimum values for these distances that ensures the minimum time requirement of our rule.Snell\u2019s law captures this requirement by specifying the bend of the ray at the interface based on the refractive index of the media.\n\nBut,why does light hurry so much ?And how does it know in advance the briefest path ? In a perfect world,there should be no rules, just matter and it\u2019s corresponding nature should be sufficient(at least until we dispel that too).Our imposition of rules are the manifestation of the nature of matter.Light is a wave so it behaves so.That\u2019s all we need to account for all it\u2019s observed behaviour.\n\nImagine if we were to let light travel in all possible ways.A wave is a periodic undulation of peaks and troughs.Imagine a light wave travelling from A to B.This will take any path unless forbidden.So it will reach B,through all possible paths.At B the resultant is the addition of all light arriving from all possible paths.So some will be crests,some troughs and a vast majority in between.But for every path there is a counter path that has opposite phase thus annihilating the effect.This means light can\u2019t travel at all.But ,consider straight line from A to B.This seems to be the only path surviving interference effects.Other waves that can bend like sound and radio waves have more wavelength to survive slightly bent waves interfering.\n\nThe fact that these are waves is enough to explain it\u2019s phenomenon.\n\nUnpredictability \u2014 The very definition of life:\n\nLife\u2019s complexity can be traced down to genome.In previous parts i have tried to give a general flavour of how almost no rules or at the very least from utter simplicity \u2014 exceedingly complex phenomenon can emerge.In biology the abstraction of the genome offers perfect vantage point of study.To create the right architecture \u2014 as we have convinced ourselves that our brains are the inspiration.Consider your are an alien species visiting earth found a watch on the rock and trying to understand the working of it.Now,they hammered it to find out \u2014 they will see nothing but springs and wheels.Now we need to understand how each of them come together towards the working whole.The difficulty of the problem arises out of this complexity of interactions that we have to understand to come up with our version of the watch.\n\nOur instruction set is written in DNA.It\u2019s long chain of four neucleotide bases \u2014 A,C,G,T.When you spell all these letters they constitute 3 billion letters for humans.These letters constitute \u2018the plan\u2019 of a human.Now suppose you have a plan for a building.It includes all the information about everything in the building \u2014 the bricks,mortar,electrical system,plumbing system etc.Now suppose you need to fix plumbing system for one particular room in the building.The plumber would take a copy of the plan \u2014 but only those pages that describe plumbing of that room.Now biology does very similar \u2014 here RNA polymerase reads the DNA ,finds the code for a particular protein and transcripts.This transcript is called \u2014 mRNA.Proteins are what we are made up of.But how does these processes represent life ?If we do not confuse life with consciousness then it\u2019s pretty simple.Life metabolizes(uses up energy) and replicates.But how can we define life as it emerges from inert matter \u2014 as i warned take away consciousness(we will get to it later)and think what constitutes life ? The fundamental character is that it\u2019s structures can edit themselves \u2014 the letters of the genome can mutate and change sometimes in response to the environment.Unlike machines that are engineered and behave in predictable fashion the very definition of life is evolution and unpredictability.Now we want to understand why does the phenomenon of life even exist ?\n\nNow let\u2019s briefly look at computers \u2014 our greatest creation.Back in 1930\u2019s Alan Turing realized that there is a way of building a machine that can in principle perform any logic \u2014 he called Turing Machine.He deviced a minimal mathematical description of such a machine. After few decades John Von Neumann decided to build one such machine.At that time they used vacuum tubes and valves for the construction.They typically have to solve the problem of making a machine that always gives right answers based on fundamentally unreliable circuitary.We still use the same architecture that they deviced in 1950\u2019s but only instantiated on different hardware.The mathematical building blocks remained the same.Now our problem is the inverse \u2014 we are given life and asked to reverse engineer it.Our objective in deciphering the brain atleast for A.G.I is in understanding it\u2019s computational principles \u2014 that might require us to understand all the biological detail.\n\nEvolution as darwin saw it :\n\nTo create a better carburator for your car we don\u2019t need to know that matter is made up of atoms and less about the intricate forces between them.We don\u2019t yet have a general consensus on the mathematical details of Bernouli\u2019s principle(except that there is slightly less pressure over a moving curved surface than a flat one),that doesn\u2019t stop us from making better flying machines.The point of this article is to convince reader that the best stratagy would be to incorporate the growing work in neuroscience and trying to build the computational model of the brain.If i am successful you would perfectly realize the role of our only model of intelligence(brain).We only have to figure out the architectural requirement of intelligence.\n\nThe living cell is the most complex system of it\u2019s size known to mankind.How can such coordinated and complex system emerge ?Evolution is simple process but the details are a fascinating read.\u00b9In the previous section we saw how evolution needs almost no explanation.Here we would look at some of the glitches we carry due to the inherent purposelessness of the process.\n\nWhy our brains are not optimal designs ?2\n\nBefore we embark on this process it\u2019s important to understand few details of evolution.Evolution for that matter any change is a purposeless process \u2014 our brains are not optimal designs.As the Nobel Laureate Francois Jacob (1977) put it, evolution is a tinkerer, who \u2018\u2018often without knowing what he is going to produce \u2026 uses what ever he finds around him, old cardboards, pieces of strings, fragments of wood or metal, to make some kind of workable object \u2026 [The result is] a patchwork of odd sets pieced together when and where the opportunity arose\u2019\u2019.In the same token our brains gullibility(Kahneman, 2003; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974 or refer Thinking Fast and Slow) clearly indicates our brains are merely a workable object , a compromise forced by the limitation of resources(an infinitely rational or a machine that could make optimal inferences in all situations would consume infinite resources.) and the constraints of evolution(Evolutionary inertia (Marcus, 2008) \u2014 the idea that evolution is constrained by previous history).\n\nWhen evolution figures out better solution older ones are not discarded.This is the reason we still possess our old reptilian instincts \u2014 they take over us in times of pressure.We struggle between reflexive and deliberative(Marcus, 2008) modes even after realizing the merit of one over the other.\n\nThe unification of the physical laws:\n\nIt\u2019s important to not make unnecessary assumptions in our search for AGI.That would seriously impede our development.Early sybolists thought mere juggling with symbolic representations would solve A.I \u2014 largely driven by a very wrong assumption which later Connectionists came with neural networks that allow for forming much richer representations.Tiny developments in the right direction are far better than hastening into dead ends.\n\nFrom this section of the text i would take a bit formal stance,for those of you who have come here for some artificial intelligence stuff \u2014 here it begins\u2026\n\nIn a way \u2014 field of Artificial intelligence has become much easier.Neural networks have become lingua-franca in all possible domains \u2014 from computer vision to complex control problems.A more representative word would be universal function approximators. Their limitation is evident \u2014 they would be great for narrow intelligence.Only reason of their recent success is beceause of the abundance of data and computing power.So,unfortunately both of them are going to improve in coming years which not only fuels their performance but also corresponding research and funding.It is important to realize why we started all of this in the first place.\n\nTraditional pattern recognition problem deals with finding optimum or valuable features of the problem.For a long time people have tried to use logic based and purely mathematical methods in hope of one day coming up with human-level A.I.This has halted the true development of A.I for decades.\n\nAlan Turing has proved mathematically that all computing devices are essentially equivalent and in proving that he imagined a 1. processing box,2.a paper tape,3.a method to read and write off it.He called it \u2014 Universal Turing Machine.In later decades this has set off computer era.Though he couldn\u2019t figure out how to create human level intelligence,proposed a test for finding if we have reached the goal ,the famous Turing test\u2014 when an A.I converses with a human and tricks him into thinking that it\u2019s a human.This focus on behaviour rather than the underlying process has made people to think that brain is a symbol manipulating device.Language is manipulation on words and vision is manipulation of objects and their locations.So,it doesn\u2019t matter how you implement it \u2014 as turing proved.If brain uses network of neurons ,we will use transistors.\n\nIn 1943 neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the mathematician Walter Pitts published an influential paper where they argued how neurons can act as logic gates.This has essentially proved that brains contain the fundamental building block of the computers.So without further biological proof they assumed that brains are nothing but computers.In later decades A.I pundits even predicted that they are close to human level A.I (it\u2019s funny how similar thing has happened with physics before the discovery of quantum mechanics and relativity).\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize how associating intelligence to outer behaviour is not the right method to access our development.It makes no sense to say that Deep Blue \u2014 the famous chess program that beat Gary kasparov has any understanding of chess.Turing Test only makes sense when we have reached the destination.Meanwhile we should try to emulate human brain as almost all the state of art developments in A.I have come from some form of inspiration from neuroscience.(Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence-Demis Hassabis, Dharshan Kumaran,Christopher Summerfield).\n\nCreating human level A.I is hard.Really hard.The search space of possible solutions are vast and we can easily be tricked.Our only source of inspiration is our brains.I do not say there can\u2019t be other ways to intelligence but only that searching for them wouldn\u2019t account for a good stratagy.Even neuroscientists seems to not have much idea of how intelligent processes happen within brain.Much of our knowledge about brains came from Functional imaging.However they cannot capture rapid changes.So,not until recently we couldn\u2019t even look at the processes happening in realtime.For long time the field of A.I has fancied with creating intresting things \u2014 hand writing recognition,anomoly detection and other pattern recognition problems.These are of great practical value but this has got little to do with our understanding of intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to distinguish superfluous details from truly important ones.Our brains are filled with lot of garbage \u2014 evolutionary junk.I suppose our solution to intelligence would be more elegant than our brains as they have evolved to cater very different needs.\n\nAround 3.5 billion years ago multicullular organisms evolved.They offered better rate of survival.With them the complexity of their processes have also increased.The nervous system allows for fast responses via electrochemical signaling and for slow responses by acting on the endocrine system.\u2074Nervous system accounts for the (1)evolvution optimal sensors and effectors that allow it to maximize its control given finite resources and (2) evolution of a behavioral repertoire that maximizes the information gained from the environment and generates optimal actions based on available sensory information\u2074.\n\nSo our brains primary motive was internal coordination \u2014 allostasis(refers to the predictive regulation of biological parameters in order to prevent deviations rather than correcting them post hoc\u2075).Our sense of joy on the achievement of goals,feelings of love and sorrow that direct our actions \u2014 intrinsic rewards \u2014 are evolutionary hack to improve our survival rate.Our capabilites to go through short term difficulties(inherently unpleasurable actions) are our learned association with them.So our behaviour arises out of this continual competition between drives and incentives that have adaptive value(Davies et al., 2012)\u2076.\n\nWe have spent most of our evolutionary time as hunter-gatherers which have influenced our behaviour patterns.Our goal is to understand the brain at algorithmic level not implementation level.All the complexity attributed to the variety of cells and the wiring of neurons in the brain when seen in the light of understanding the basic algorithm would seem a lot less daunting.More importantly we should focus on the neocortex(the seat of intelligence where much of language and reasoning happens) and it\u2019s remarkable homogenity of structure.In 1978 Mountcastle published a paper titled \u201cAn Organizing Principle for Cerebral Function.\u201d In this paper,he points out that the neocortex is remarkably uniform in appearance and structure. The regions of cortex that handle auditory input look like the regions that handle touch, which look like the regions that control muscles, which look like Broca\u2019s language area, which look like practically every other region of the cortex.\u2079\n\nConsider what according to me is the coolest achievement of the present state of art(march,2018) in A.I \u2014 we have made algorithms(AlphaGo) that beat human expert in the game of Go(considered more subtle and hard game than chess for machines).AlphaGo is initially trained on 28.4 million positions and moves from 160,000 unique games(by using a combination of deep convolutional neural networks (convnets) and Monte Carlo Tree search (Silver et al., 2016))\u2078 played by human experts; it then improves through reinforcement learning, playing 30 million more games against itself. Between the publication of Silver et al. (2016) and before facing world champion Lee Sedol, AlphaGo was iteratively retrained several times in this way; the basic system always learned from 30 million games, but it played against successively stronger versions of itself, effectively learning from 100 million or more games altogether (Silver, 2016)\u2078. In contrast, Lee has probably played around 50,000 games in his entire life.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s not an accurate way to compare given the pretraining humans receive in terms of the transferable skills they bring to the table even before they start learning anything unlike neural network based models that are trained from scratch.But there is a fundamental differences in the flexibility of our learned representations\u2014 Consider various possible variants of the game Go.The wikipedia page \u201cGo variants\u201d describes versions such as playing on bigger or smaller board sizes (ranging from 9\u00d79 to 38\u00d738, not just the usual 19\u00d719 board), or playing on boards of different shapes and connectivity structures (rectangles, triangles, hexagons, even a map of the English city Milton Keynes). The board can be a torus, a mobius strip, a cube or a diamond lattice in three dimensions. Holes can be cut in the board, in regular or irregular ways. The rules can be adapted to what is known as First Capture Go (the first player to capture a stone wins), NoGo (the player who avoids capturing any enemy stones longer wins) or Time Is Money Go (players begin with a fixed amount of time and at the end of the game, the number of seconds remaining on each player\u2019s clock is added to their score).Human players can understand these variants and adapt to them because they explicitly represent Go as a game, with a goal to beat an adversary who is playing to achieve the same goal they are, governed by rules about how stones can be placed on a board and how board positions are scored. Humans represent their strategies as a response to these constraints, such that if the game changes, they can begin to adjust their strategies accordingly.\u2077\n\nConsider grid of cells coloured red or black based on simple rules.The concept is better illustrated through the following example."

        "text": "This series is aimed at readers who have already heard the ideas discussed here but looking for deeper understanding.Machine learning is fastly changing.Now,i can\u2019t imagine the practical need to use svm\u2019s .Neural network models could almost always replace svm\u2019s.But,they were clear state of art until recently.My point is understanding the logical evolution of ideas is more important than the algorithms or fancier architectures..\n\nSo let\u2019s get going.GAN\u2019S are generative models that will learn the distribution of data to generate new points.Imagine a random image(sampled from gaussian distribution) sent through a neural network.The output of the network is also of same size(image).Now if we could tell the network to tweak it\u2019s parameters until the output image is close to our reference image but different,we got a generative model.It could generate images from random noise.The only requirement is that it should be differentiable to let us nudge the weights with backprop(for introduction to backprop refer part-2).\n\nSo ,we could use a classifier to tell us if the generated image is fake or real.That is if we feed the output of the generator to the classifier ,it should spit out the probability of it being real.If we could devise a cost function that can make generator produce more realistic images and the classifier to more accurately identify fakes \u2026\u2026 we got a GAN.\n\nImportant thing to notice here is the classifier is not pretrained.It is trained along with the generator.\n\nstage 1: Take some samples of random noise to get fake data and some actual data points(real data) to train the classifier.\n\nstage 2:Keep the weights of the classifier locked and use the output of classifier to train generator.\n\nThis process keeps on alternating until it converges\u2026\n\nNow,let\u2019s look at the actual loss function we are looking to minimize.\n\nNow in stage 1 we start with generator and tune classifier.\n\nNow we seek to find the argument G that minimizes the loss with given D*(x).\n\nThus,we see how we could eventually land up with our generator distribution closer to the data distribution\u2026.Now,if you have managed to come this far you are good to read some of the orginal papers..understandig gan\u2019s,goodfellow\u2019s generative adversarial nets."

        "text": "This is part 2 of the series,for the introduction \u2014 part 1.In machine learning we often start with an inductive bias i.e before we let the data determine the right set of weights or parameters , we constrict the function space.For example, in case of linear models(svm\u2019s,linear regression,random forests etc) we expect the underlying distribution to fall into our hypothesis space before actually looking at the data.Deep learning though offering infinite flexibility in terms of functions it can approximate,it\u2019s been hard to train big networks(with lot\u2019s of weights).\n\nConsider the above figure from part 1,we initially start with random weights that throws out a random output.Now if we could find a sensible way of measuring the departure of this output and tweak the weights(preferably all of them at once) we could expect the network to eventually have the right set of weights.But,we could as well change them one by one (in a network with millions of weights).That would save us this post(no,backprop\u2026).Is that a reasonable policy\u2026let\u2019s figure out.We will start with a linear model and see if we could find the right weights by constructively trying out different values.\n\nLook at the above code carefully ,we started out with random \u2018w\u2019 and changed it by 0.5(arbitrary choice) in the direction of decreasing l_sum.Here loss is defined as (y_pred- y).\n\nBut,in case of neural networks we got no way of knowing the direction of change in \u2018w\u2019 to decrease the loss as the relationship between loss and parameters is no longer linear..(i.e we can\u2019t expect to reduce \u2018w\u2019 to reduce loss).Also if we got multiple weights say w1,w2 in our model we have to perturb them together (4 combinations of w1 and w2 i.e increase w1 and w2 slightly,increase w1 and decrease w2 etc.) to find the right combination.I think we can quickly see now how a network with millions of weights becomes infeasible to tweak for right weights.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be complete introduction to calculus but a refresher if you have already tackled it once.Particularly,we would try to figure out how to tweak each variable of a multivariable function to move it in the right direction.\n\nConsider the above function,in case of one variable functions derivative refers to the ratio of the change in \u2018y\u2019 when there is a slight nudge in \u2018x\u2019.But,if \u2018f\u2019 depends on more variables than we could define partial derivative i.e change in f on changing only one variable keeping the rest constant.In the above function if we let y = 1 as constant ,than P.D w.r.t \u2018x\u2019 refers to the solpe of the function on the plane.Similarly we could have P.D w.r.t \u2018y\u2019.(i.e \u2018x\u2019 as constant )\n\nSo but at a given point on a function we could pass a plane in any direction.Thus,our nudge in independent variables is a vector.\n\nSo,this brings about the concept of directional derivative.Our task now is to find out the right direction to decrease our loss function,this would let us tweak all the variables at once and eventually reach global minimum.We would later prove gradient is the direction of steepest increase of a function.Thus we have to move in the opposite direction to rapidly decrease a function locally.\n\nI think it is obvious to see directional derivative as the change in function when we move along a direction.It could be represented as a dot product between gradient and the unit vector in that direction\u2026.\n\nTo prove gradient as the direction of steepest ascent,it\u2019s helpful to see directional derivative as the dot product between gradient and the unit vector w.\n\nSo ,to maximize the change in function for a given change along w,it\u2019s sensible to make both gradient and w point along the same direction.\n\nThus , a function changes most rapidly along the direction of gradient.Now ,how to compute the gradient of a function with millions of weights faster\u2026..\n\nThe idea of backprop is pretty simple,once if we could see how the chain rule makes sense i.e change in f due to slight nudge in x is equal to the product of chage in q(intermediate variable) and change in f due to this change.The reason for defining these intermediate variables might seem quite arbitrary at first,but if i say at each node if i keep track of the partial derivative of the output w.r.t inputs that would let me update all the weights at once..(look at the figure carefully to verify)\n\nThus a complex loss function can be represented as a computational graph(the one shown below) with each node keeping track of forward computation and gradients of the output w.r.t inputs.."

        "text": "Deep learning techniques in computer vision has surpassed human level accuracy i.e now a computer can more accurately tell if a given picture is a cat or dog.In this post we will get a feel for the mechanics of the process that makes it possible.\n\nLet\u2019s represent an image by a point \u2018x\u2019 (a bunch of pixel values) and try to figure out set of rules for any image classification task \u2014 here recognizing faces.Our visual system is incredibly complex and each scene goes through complex chain of image processing tasks.Let\u2019s assume(for the sake of simplicity) that we could weigh set of binary decisions like is there an eye in the top left of the image or is there a mouth at the bottom etc to decide a face.Though seemingly grossly incorrect we would see how this approach would finally outperform (with some tricks and hacks) humans.\n\nAlmost any sort of intelligent task can be seen as passing a set of inputs through a function or a mapping (it can be dynamic) that spits out the actions or the results.For image classification we got to find a mapping from \u2018x\u2019 to \u2018y\u2019 to indicate whether it\u2019s an image of face.\n\nWhat if we would come up with a series of transformations(mappings) from input space to neatly split all the images into two classes face and non-face.For instance i might come up with an arbitrary rule like if the sum of all the pixel values of my image are greater than 1000 (consider all images are of equal size) than they are faces.Ok,that\u2019s too naive to be useful but what if we would let our algorithm figure out the right set of rules by only providing the error on each prediction.This is the fundamental idea behind deep learning.To make our function space rich enough we include non-linearities like relu,sigmoid,tanh etc.\n\nNote:Multiple arrows from each neuron indicates a single activation duplicated to form inputs for next layer.\n\nConsider simple mapping y = mx + c that takes an input x and maps to y with m and c as parameters.\n\nIn case of our image data we will have x as a vector of image size as input with m and c as corresponding vectors of variables whose values we got to tweak.Our aim would be to reduce error.Our mention of non-linearities simply means passing output y through a non-linear function like sigmoid.\n\nTheoretically the form of non-linearity doesn\u2019t matter(we will discuss them in the future posts),so for now take sigmoid as a convenient substitute.So each circle in the above figure performs a liner operation followed by a squashing function like sigmoid.Virtually all the neurons are same except each one taking the output\u2019s of previous layers as inputs.Output will be 1 or 0 indicating face or non-face(here as the last neuron also has sigmoid activation we will get values between 0 and 1 indicating the probability of face).But,how will we figure out the right weights.That\u2019s the question of next post(Backpropagation).\n\nNOTE : It takes some time and practise to actually appreciate how nothing but the above structure can perform arbitrary complex tasks from image recognition to language models.We would be building some along the way.."

        "text": "In this post i will try to lay the framework of my inquiry of finding out ways to live better life.We are prone to far too many biases and invalid mental structures that determine what we experience every day.My aim is to find out simple principles that make a good life effortless.Here\u2019s what i copied,tweaked and learned from various people,disciplines and life.\n\nWhat do we want out of life ? More important is the question- Are we designed to lead a happy and satisfying life ?Our anatomy sets limitations to our activities.We need eyes to see,legs to walk and brains to think.But our brains seem to play the whole game.\n\nThen, what determines our brain,our thinking,our deepest instincts and needs ?Why are we they way we do? All attempts to answer these questions were futile until 1859.His name was Charles Darwin.His observations brought a fundamental shift in how we view life.\n\nThe Theory of Natural Selection and Why We Make Poor Choices ?\n\nNatural selection is not a game nature has devised to make way for the more fitter and saner species.It\u2019s a motiveless pursuit where the most ruthless and selfish gene of the lot survives.Consider some group of animals of which a mutant is born \u2014 for example this guy is slightly more aggressive than his peers.Even if this new quality gives slightly more advantage in terms of it\u2019s basic survival needs like gathering food or procuring female,in the long run it\u2019s gene stands more chance of remaining in the lot.But this process takes time.It is not guaranteed that at any time the majority members of the species are the ones most suited to the environment.The mutant members might not have yet disrupted the population or it might be the case that the conditions have changed unfavorably to wipe out this new trait.\n\nBut,what is a gene?What does it do?\n\nGenes are what makes up our body.These are the code that determine everything from the way our bodies are built to the secretion of right enzymes.We inherit 46 chromosomes from our parents that go into each cell our bodies.Each chromosome is made up a chemical DNA.Genes are the segments of our DNA \u2014 a sequence of four chemical molecules:adenine ,guanine ,thymine and cytosine.\n\nThe job of genes is to make proteins \u2014 the building blocks of life.Neurotransmitters are the special proteins that trigger electric impulses in our brain.It\u2019s the Neurotransmitter serotonin that is associated with stress and depression.It\u2019s the chemistry in our brains that determine how we feel and act.\n\nThere is more to the story, it\u2019s not some mean genes that determine our lives.Sometimes a gene is \u2018\u2019switched off\u2019\u2019 and can\u2019t make proteins.Scientists discovered a mechanism called RNA interference that could switch off a genes.\n\nThe question of Nature vs Nurture\n\nLife is highly interdependent,there are no specific gene for happy life nor does our parental inheritance determine our fate.Our genetic expression(The on and off of particular gene) depends on it\u2019s environment.Neural connections we make are shaped by our life experiences.Our experiences in turn depend on our state of mind.\n\nHere is where our approach differs .We will first tame the beast.We do not try to fight our biochemistry.We are pre-built with the neural connections that determine our interpretation of certain events.Our brains have evolved in completely different circumstances than us .We have spent much our time on earth as wild foragers.From our unnatural fears of public speaking to our appetite for excessive spending we owe a lot to our ancestral foragers.Evolution has left us with deep traits that are geared toward the optimal sustenance of a hunter-gatherer rather than a modern city dweller.To thrive and live to our fullest our present conditions we need a far differently equipped brain.\n\nHow can we seduce ourselves to take the path less traveled.It turns out that one\u2019s who did offers us many insights.Here we will explore ways to raise above our limitations,make uncomfortable choices and lead more joyful lives.Now that we laid some foundation and gained some understanding of what drives us \u2014 in subsequent posts we will focus on the specific tools and strategies evolved by some of the most successful people .We will figure out how they manage to short-circuit their ancestral motives to overcome their fears and weaknesses."

There were aristocrats who permitted various kinds\n\n of action that were not tolerated among the bourgeoisie.\n\nVirtually on every imaginable aspect people have divided into sets.Muslims are allowed to eat meat after performing elaborate rite involving cutting the front of the throat, the carotid artery, trachea, and jugular veins of animal and the performer instructed to look into the eyes of the animal until all the blood is drained,then the Islamic prayer \u2018Bismillah\u2019 purifies the animal.The whole process seems to be designed for optimal pain for the animal and awoke reasonable remorse after some slaughters in any human being.It may as well been a best slaughter-control protocol if not left to free intrepretation.\n\nThis whole process of indoctrination by culture severely limits our capacity for joy,innovation and change.Just because something is not widely practiced,shouldn\u2019t discourage us doing it.To find anything new we need courage to abandon the known.But we have premordial instinct that takes over every time we act,it\u2019s been optimally designed to survive in wild \u2014 we form habits that eventually passes over the guard of reason and flow through us unnoticed.\n\nMy own belief is that a conscious thought can be planted into the unconscious if sufficient amount of vigour and intensity is put into it.Most of the unconscious consists of what were once highly emotional conscious thoughts,which have now become buried.It is possible to do this process of burying deliberately,and in this way the unconscious can be led to do a lot of useful work.\n\nWe can take control of our life to go beyond the expectations of our tribe,to truly fathom the possibilities of life.Only with a tinge of madness and disregard for status-quo can we leave our dear past ,fight-back the comforts of conformity."
