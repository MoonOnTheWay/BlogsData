        "text": "Lamont Johnson is the CEO/Founder of The Art Department, LLC, which is a premier public relations firm that has clients in a wide array of industries including: beauty, fashion, lifestyle, health, business, entertainment and more. His company aggressively pitches clients for stories, segments, and profiles, which in turn, bring exposure to their businesses and the products/services that they are selling. Aside from pitching his own clients, he often consults with other PR firms (both smaller and larger) on how to garner placements for their clients. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage Pitching is an art \u2014 and make this art a priority. There are many aspects to our career as publicists. Writing press releases, conference calls, creating PR plans, coordinating interviews, and more. But no matter how busy you are doing these things (which ARE important), always have on your pitching hat. Make sure your pitch is a fit to the outlet/contact that you\u2019re pitching to. With pitching, make sure that your pitch is a good fit for the outlet, writer, or producer that you\u2019re pitching to. For example, if an outlet covers fashion, you should not be pitching your food and beverage client. But \u2014 \u2014 in that fashion magazine, they may have a F&B column. It is your job to find out and find that writer (who contributes to that column), if your client requests to be featured in that outlet. So many people pitch media daily, so they are often inundated with emails and calls, so please save their time (and yours) by making sure you are pitching something that makes sense. Timing is everything. Please take heed to this, especially when expecting coverage. For instance, if you are pitching a product for a Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide (which usually runs in late May/early June), you may want to start pitching this in February if you plan to get this featured in a printed magazine \u2014 as they have a much longer lead time than newspapers or online outlets. Follow up with media. There are times where a media outlet will respond to your pitch, set up an interview then go radio-silent. It is your job to follow up with that outlet to make sure that the story gets published or that segment airs. This follow up can range from a simple phone or an email. But please do not get pushy with a journalist about writing the story. A simple call stating, \u201cHello. I was just calling about [your client] and wanted to see if you need anything else from me for the feature.\u201d That is a pleasant way of keeping it on their radar. Media Tracking. Whether its Cision or Melt Water, it is important for you to track your placements. There is nothing worse than pitching a story, getting interests, sending information/pictures, setting up interviews, and totally missing the placement when it runs. Even if you don\u2019t have software, monitor the web, created Google Alerts for your clients, comb the web, frequent newsstands, DVR the segments. Don\u2019t let the placement run and disappear.\n\nChristina Towle received her B.A. from Princeton University and has worked in production for Manhattan media companies including Wiley, Forbes Magazine, and ABC News helping with the launch of Good Morning America Weekend starting September 4, 2004. She has a proven track record of placements within national outlets utilizing consumer, medical, and natural brand media including Huffington Post, Redbook, Oprah, NBC news, Whole Foods Magazine, The Examiner, and Dr. Oz Show.

There is a energy that follows true belief and people respond to that energy with enthusiasm. I work and use the health-inspiring brands I promote because the better I feel, the more I achieve! Learn the Story: Study a brand or person as if you are writing a thesis or New York Times front page article on them. From source to present, learn every detail and angle of the brand or client\u2019s background. This will assist in posturing placement among different platforms. Also, grow with their story\u2026continue to tweak and update it\u2026which will encourage evergreen opportunities and top news features. Build your Tribe: We know in marketing that it takes multiple impressions for someone to stop, click, and buy. The same is for getting people to try, experience, and share about a brand or person. A publicist doesn\u2019t stand out for simply sending samples and sharing press releases. However, we do standout when we develop relationships with the media \u2014 become friends on social, check-in on their calendar, and actually help them craft stories that feature the brands or talent we represent. Since she founded DiGennaro Communications (DGC) in 2006, Samantha DiGennaro\u2019s PR counsel is considered invaluable.

Sam\u2019s energy, creativity and vision drives DGC\u2019s culture and sets the tone for deep and longstanding client, press, industry and influencer relationships. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage Build your credibility with the press: Many executives want to be featured in top-tier media outlets, but getting high-profile press coverage out of the gate is a pretty rare occurrence. I recommend that executives work to build relationships with reporters. For example, you can offer briefings over coffee that allow you to showcase your industry smarts or story ideas, and you can also proactively share your POV on news of the day that is relevant to your area of expertise. Building relationships in this way allows for there to be a true value exchange. Once you\u2019ve built a relationship with a reporter, a news feature or profile piece could be easier to come by. Consider trade press, blogs and influencers: Don\u2019t get me wrong. Every company and executive wants to be featured in The New York Times or Wall Street Journal, and it certainly should be a goal. But like I stated before, that can be a challenge right of the gate and sometimes can take months to happen. In the meantime, don\u2019t shy away from speaking to trade reporters, bloggers, and other influencers. These reporters are always looking for reputable sources and could help build your public profile. Not to mention most top-tier reporters and broadcast producers usually read niche publications for inspiration. You\u2019d be surprised how many reporters approach execs because they saw them quoted somewhere else! Be provocative: Reporters are looking for sources to provide pithy, memorable quotes. If you are being quoted for a story, try to provide a point of view that is unique to what is already being said. Don\u2019t be afraid to be provocative and challenge the status quo. Reporters love showing differing viewpoints or even tension in their stories. Another way to get press attention is by contributing an opinion piece that is provocative and has a strong viewpoint on a current news issue. Many daily newspapers and trade publications publish opinion pieces but the main requirement is a fresh and provocative voice. Panday is a publicist at Metro Public Relations, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s leading PR firms representing Digital Studios and some of YouTube and the Social Media world\u2019s biggest stars. Panday specializes in translating the news of the Internet and pop culture to traditional mainstream press. On a day-to-day basis, he liaises on behalf of digital talent to amplify viral videos; support branded product and book launches; and secure press to drive personal PR narratives with philanthropy and events. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage I work on behalf of \u201cdigital stars,\u201d the Julia Roberts\u2019 and Brad Pitts of Gen Z. And the biggest obstacle I encounter is the work of translating value: \u201cWhy is this relevant to my audience?\u201d If you, too, work in the digital space, where 15 minutes of fame are fleeting, and, candidly there\u2019s just a lot of junk out there, here is how to make your news pop: 1. Show Me The Money: Facts, figures and statistics are your friends. It\u2019s your job as translator to make the news \u201cclick\u201d in an industry where old-school producers and editors may not readily see the value. Offer up numbers that speak to how influential your talent is and how their story will equate to clicks on their content. For digital talent, that can be \u201csubscriber number\u201d or \u201cvideo views;\u201d or an accolade from a legacy news organization or established industry guild that puts the news into context and qualifies the work. 2. Fortune Favors the Bold: I work with press to tell stories that begin on the Internet. In the world of six-second video and text messaging, picking up the phone is a lost art for today\u2019s generation of publicists. In my first job, I spent hours cold-calling reporters and learning how to pivot on the fly. Phone calls, while requiring a strong sense of resiliency, should also be direct and succinct, and are often the most productive weapon in a publicist\u2019s tool belt. Today\u2019s talk show bookers often source their on-camera experts from a stable of talent they can trust to speak intelligently \u2014 and it all begins with a coffee introduction. 3. Don\u2019t Abuse The Power: As publicists, we are often gatekeepers of highly desired information and people. In Hollywood, it\u2019s ten-fold. Plenty of people in this town have built careers by strong-arming press to reach their client\u2019s goals, but I believe the ones that have longevity are the ones who realize it\u2019s a two-way street. You are a reflection of your client and an extension of their brand, so it\u2019s important to work as a collaborator to deliver for both parties. There\u2019s a lot to the old saying, \u201cYou can win more flies with honey,\u201d and reporters have a long memory.\u201d\n\nWith over 17 years of experience in both B2B and B2C marketing, I excel in harnessing the power of social, digital, and traditional media to increase brand awareness, elevate market share and catapult revenues. I\u2019m solidly credentialed in PR & social media, technically savvy, and backed by a vast network of influential contacts in media, music, blockchain, design, tech and finance. I\u2019m a hyper networker, advising startups, VC\u2019s and entrepreneurs on how to communicate their value proposition in an ever changing market. But most importantly, I really love what I do. A few highlights? Bonusly\u2019s guest appearance on Colorado Public Radio News, InVision\u2019s inclusion in Forbes 2016 Next Billion-Dollar Startups, the creation of Bandsintown\u2019s nationwide ambassador program and an in-studio giveaway on Ellen Degeneres 12 Days of Christmas program. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage TIP #1: HOW DOES YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE GET THEIR INFORMATION? The answer often times is not NYT or TechCrunch. As part of onboarding at Cast Influence, we ask all new clients to identify what their target audience is reading, listening to and watching, since nowadays there are so many ways to consume media. We then dig in deeper. YouTube, podcasts, brand-specific newsletters, partner marketing \u2014 there are multiple avenues PR can pursue to identify interesting story angles that map back to client\u2019s goals. Put yourself in your customer\u2019s shoes. You have a problem and you go to a search engine to look for a solution. What keywords or phrases do you look up? These keywords become part of PR targeting so anytime a journalist is discussing said topic, follow and subscribe to their coverage to stay up on what they\u2019re reporting. We then offer ourselves or clients as a resource for future commentary, data, or customer stories outside of breaking news cycles. The goal is to be helpful to journalists on deadline vs. requesting coverage when it\u2019s self-serving. There\u2019s a reason Amazon allows shoppers to soft by \u2018Average Customer Review\u2019. Just as consumers are averse to advertising, so too are journalists who receive thousands of pitches a day shouting \u2018DISRUPT!\u2019 Assuming you have an established product or service, offer press the chance to speak with customers who advocate for your brand. It\u2019s much more authentic for a reporter to hear how your company is disruptive from a customer than it is your CMO.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage \u201cFrom our almost decade track record of securing strong media placements for our clients, we have learned what some of the most strategic ways are to earn strong good media coverage. Our Top 3 Tips Include: Ensure you are presenting the benefits, vs just the features, of your clients\u2019 offerings. Back in my pharmaceutical sales\u2019 days, I had to go through extreme sales training, and the motto that was ingrained in our minds during this training was, \u201cFeatures Tell, Benefits Sell.\u201d When trying to persuade the media to share your clients\u2019 offering, they themselves need to be sold on why these offerings are compelling enough to write about. You are actually selling an idea to the media, first. Know how to do so concisely, yet thoroughly. What we have found is that follow up is key. Media contacts receive hundreds of pitches a day, and sometimes the timing is just off and they may not have even read your pitch. We like to send out a follow up email 7\u201310 days after an initial pitch, unless there is a time sensitivity to the matter. If the topic is urgent, we follow up with a call. Depending on the topic and timeliness of it (such as having sent out very early in advance, we may send a revised 3rd follow up with updated details, but this isn\u2019t common, as we assume after 2 tries, that the contacts is not interested. After a couple of times pitching the same angle without a response, we know it\u2019s time to find a new angle. Try to uncover the hidden objections. There are many times that, based on the relationships we have established with key media contacts, we are able to ask why a certain pitch has been passed on. With this pertinent information, we can then go back to the client and devise a way to overcome this objection, if there is a way to do so, and reach back out to these media contacts with the revised pitch, many times, loading the placement.\n\nCarrie Simons is CEO and President of Triple 7 Public Relations, a leading boutique publicity firm with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Nashville that handles corporate consulting, brand development and entertainment publicity.

More information on Triple 7 PR and its clients can be found at http://triple7pr.com. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage \u201cI always find the most successful press coverage is generated for those campaigns that I am truly passionate about because that passion resonates in the conversations I have with media. As a result, Triple 7 PR only signs clients that we are excited to represent. Through this internal litmus test, we know that we offer value to the stories told by media through the clients we\u2019re pitching. The following three strategies always have served us well: 1. Understand your clients completely before pitching them and work on your written pitches until you have them dialed in before your first press outreach. The best media opportunities come from a true understanding of who you\u2019re pitching and what will resonate with those you\u2019re speaking with as well as being able to pivot on the phone, or in person, to other angles of coverage that might yield a better result. If you truly know your client and appreciate their value for press coverage, you\u2019ll find more ways to secure those key opportunities. 2. Put yourself in the position of those you\u2019re pitching. By taking a moment to recognize the person you\u2019re communicating with, their current focus and their timeline, you\u2019re best equipped to strategize your efforts in a way that will resonate with them. We always try to focus our pitch efforts on the timing that would be most convenient for the media we\u2019re pitching, not the timing that works best for our to-do lists. By having the respect for when media are on deadlines, trying to get home to their families or going on hiatus, we hope to get their attention during periods where they\u2019re able to focus on the client pitch we\u2019re offering to them instead of being frustrated that we don\u2019t respect their schedule. 3. Remain optimistic and positive. If you\u2019re not getting the result you want or hearing back, don\u2019t let your frustration impact the tone of your follow up. Remain upbeat and tenacious. We all know that some campaigns are easier than others, and sometimes the domino effect of media doesn\u2019t happen in the timeline you\u2019d expect. Keep finding unique angles that you truly believe should be spotlighted and stay engaged in conversations with those writers and bookers you believe are best for telling the story. By working as a team to make the opportunity happen, regardless of how long it takes, you\u2019ll eventually succeed and celebrate the accomplishment together.\u201c Matthew Aversa founded Twenty One PR in 2011, at the age of 17, creating a public relations, social media, event production and branding company for the 21st Century.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage Stay up to date on current events. Spend a little time each day researching the top trending stories around the world. Turn on the TV in the morning and catch some news. If you are in the celebrity space, catch an episode of TMZ or pick up one of the weeklies such as Star and In Touch. Know what is happening in the world around you so that you know what value you bring and what outlet you can bring it. Stay up to date with colleagues. Professionals in the media world are always on the move. Stay in touch with reporters, producers, freelancers, paparazzi, etc. to be sure you know what outlets they are working for at all times. Building relationships with the media is critical, as they are who will keep you in the spotlight and you\u2019ll know exactly who to reach out to and when. Stay up to date with internet trends. It\u2019s hard these days to keep track of every social media platform these days. That\u2019s why keeping up with human behavior on specific platforms is important. Is Snapchat better than Instagram? Is Facebook better than Google Plus? Do your research and know what your target demographics are and where they spend most of their time engaging online.\n\nA veteran of several top agencies, Vijay is a results-producing PR & Marketing Communications professional offering over 17 years of experience working with both established global brands and startups. He is experienced in both consumer b2c and corporate b2b communications across a variety of categories including tech, health & wellness, beauty, food & beverage, travel & hospitality and more. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of launching a new product or brand, or even announcing a business update. Regardless of what you are building an earned media plan around, it is important to define a clear objective at the forefront. Think about what you want to achieve and what the desired end result is. Be it general awareness or some type of call-to-action, an effective story to pitch cannot be packaged without a clear objective. Once you define a clear objective and start to package the story, content and any other resources, keep your reporter hat on throughout the entire process. Think about what the reporters are looking for. Ask the important questions: what is the news here? does this make sense for the outlet? is this relevant for the readers/audience? how do I capture the reader\u2019s attention? I like to come up with a few headlines that I know would be a win and make sure the story we tell has the substance to validate that headline. The media universe is more cluttered now than ever before. We have real news and fake news, new products and technology launching every day, \u2018content\u2019 is a household word and almost every brand has at least one influencer as a partner. The only way to break through the clutter and stand out is to be bold and disruptive. Make sure you have a strong message, create an experience or tactic that is unexpected and don\u2019t be afraid to go the extra mile to position yourself as an expert in your industry.

Kim currently leads consumer PR at HelloFresh. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1. Always do your research: know who you\u2019re pitching, know their audience, and think if this would resonate with them. Most people blindly pitch like throwing paint on a wall to see what sticks. You have to do your research. 2. Network, network, network: Make sure you get out there and meet with editors at key magazines, freelancers who are covering for a variety of publications, etc. The key to success is getting face time, learning about that writer\u2019s background, and figuring out how you can work together. This is beneficial to both parties \u2014 you learn what they like and they stop getting irrelevant pitches. 3. Find common interest between your brand/product and the writer: Does the writer use your product/brand? Do they have a personal interest in the category? This will help the writer see an actual use for your brand/product vs trying to figure out if it would work. For example, if you\u2019re pitching a skin cream, find a writer who has a skincare regime. If you\u2019re pitching a book, find a writer who reads that genre or considers themselves a secret bookworm.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1. If you don\u2019t believe in the story you\u2019re pitching, no one else will either! Make sure you actually now what you\u2019re talking about. If you truly believe your client\u2019s burger is the greatest in New York City, its going to be so much easier to convince a writer to include it in their roundup of the best burgers. 2. Be deliberate with your outreach. I\u2019ve worked at agencies that believed in the \u201c\u201dcast a wide net\u201d\u201d policy, but that\u2019s not how I teach my team to pitch and that\u2019s not how we\u2019ve had success. Know the story angle you\u2019re pitching, research the specific contact you\u2019re pitching, and send a pitch specifically targeted to them. 3. Don\u2019t be an insecure publicist. I used to get nervous about emailing too often or following up. It is your job to publicize your clients and it is a writer/editor\u2019s job to find good stories/leads. If you\u2019ve done your research and truly believe that the writer you\u2019re pitching would be interested in the story angle, follow up until you get an answer. If that answer is no, find a new angle and get back to it! A no is an answer you can take back to your client as tangible feedback; no answer at all means you simply gave up on a story that you didn\u2019t think was worth pursuing.\n\nRoss Garner is the COO co-owner of the boutique full service PR and Marketing firm Media Maison which focuses on lifestyle consumer products. With a NO BS approach to PR, Media Maison produces top tier placements for their clients. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1 \u2014 BUILD RELATIONSHIPS \u2014 this is what your clients are buying from you. You will only ever get so far with blind pitching. You need to cultivate strong relationships with editors, producers and influencers in various markets. Our best placements come from working with people we know and trust. A major morning show producer once told me she gets at least 1000 unsolicited pitches a day \u2014 and she deletes them all. She looks to those people she knows and trusts them for the best items for segments. 2 \u2014 PEEL THE ONION IN A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS \u2014 a client will come to you with a story or a product. Clients will often think they have the best product ever created or think they doing something revolutionary that no one has done before. It is our job as publicists to peel the onion in a million different ways and tell that story in as many ways as possible. In a market saturated with experts and products all competing for a finite number of placements \u2014 you need to know what makes your client the best in the field. Identify it and use it to your advantage. This allows for the maximum number of placements in a wide array of outlets. 3 \u2014 FOLLOW UP \u2014 this is so simple and never expect a piece of press to just magically appear. We are living in a world where media giants are buying each other, lay offs are a daily occurrence and that person who used to write one piece a month is now writing 7. That \u201c\u201dTop 5 Toys for Your Toddler\u201d\u201d or \u201c\u201dBest Items For Girls Night\u201d\u201d piece means everything to client \u2014 but your media contact has a lot going on too. Understand that and be sure to follow up \u2014 respectively of course. And ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS write a thank you note. It is 2018 and we are attached to our devices but a handwritten note always goes a long way.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1) Social Media \u2014 Utilize social media to get into the conversation. So many of my clients have received media coverage by being active on social media. Follow a list of editors who frequently cover your industry, read their articles and add feedback or insight to their stories. Also, create a strong voice on your feeds and platforms. If it is authentic and you have knowledge, the media will find you! 2) LinkedIn \u2014 this platform is a great space to get noticed and position yourself as an expert. A friend of mine published a great article on social media influencers, 20/20 reached out and she scoured a segment on the show. I think this resource is under used and I personally know many editors and producers, who use it when looking for story ideas and sources. 3) Editorial Calendar \u2014 Create an an editorial calendar each year. Most outlets are going to cover seasonal topics such as; Black History Month, Easter, Mother\u2019s Day, Earth Day etc. See where you can fit in, when it comes to being an expert for their stories of where your product offer may be useful. Make it a point to reach out with enough lead time, to potentially be included.\n\nKaren is a PR, Media, and Communications professional with more than 20 years of experience working with organizations to grow their brands.

Knowing that the work we do can truly impact a company\u2019s performance is a distinct motivator when creating comprehensive communications campaigns. Early in a campaign, we leverage journalist and producer face to face time through a range of media desksides where we introduce the client, product or service while discussing editorial opportunities and relevant storylines for the coming year. We can weave our range of clients into editorial plans early on and better service our media contacts with lead time. Additionally, we create a series of touchpoints for experiential opportunities with media. Whether it\u2019s a screening event or launch party or stunt activation, we want to offer journalists dedicated time with the brand we are servicing. To be able to directly interact with what we are pitching creates more robust content for everyone. Finally, we drive impactful results by not only well-thought out pitches, well-researched outlets, well-individualized approaches, but a complete sense of gratitude for the media! We understand their deadlines, beats, content needs and become a true partner in their editorial priorities. It\u2019s all about personal relationships and we never lose sight of that. Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage My business evolved out of event marketing into PR. That was due to the fact that the number one lesson in PR is exactly what it is. PUBLIC RELATIONS. You relate, you pitch what is a true story, it becomes relevant. My second strategy would be to FOLLOW UP. Lots of PR is missed due to deadlines and the \u201clost email\u201d. Stay true and on top of it. My final strategy goes back to the word \u201crelations\u201d. Relate to the journalists you work with. Know about them. Understand what they need and want to cover. Maintain a relationship with them behind the pitch. It might be antiquated but you do catch more flies with honey.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1. Spend quality time on your pitch and story idea. Remember\u2026this email has a significant amount of weight as to whether or not a reporter will even respond to you. It must be concise and creative, and achieving those two things is no easy task. Refrain from writing a pitch and sending it right away (unless it\u2019s time sensitive). Brainstorm with your team, tear your drafts apart (yes, drafts is plural), and put yourself in the reporter\u2019s shoes before you hit send. Don\u2019t be afraid to share it with a fellow colleague to see if it passes the sniff test either. If it\u2019s not newsworthy, make it newsworthy. And if it\u2019s a dead end, be able to recognize that and move on to another (and better) idea. 2. Following up is critical, so stop thinking you\u2019re annoying. The media is one busy bunch. They are fighting multiple stories with tight deadlines and constant breaking news and don\u2019t always have a chance to respond. I have received many messages from reporters apologizing for their delay and how much they appreciated me contacting them again. If you did your research and crafted a helluva good pitch, then you have nothing to worry about when contacting a reporter for a second or third time. 3. Media is like a ripple effect, but it takes time to build. You nailed your first story \u2014 great. Second story \u2014 excellent. Don\u2019t stop there. The more you are in the media, the more you become known as an industry expert, thought leader, or go-to source for information. This is what you want, but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. We grew one client\u2019s earned media coverage by about 2,000 percent \u2014 it sounds ridiculous, I know, but it took three years to build. Now, organic media mentions and unsolicited requests come in on a usual basis, and it\u2019s icing on the cake. Kellie Walsh started her career working in the high paced world of transaction PR.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1) Be strategic: I will often say that media pitching is like a game of connect the dots. It\u2019s more than just reading what the journalist has been writing on recently and talking about on Twitter. You need to look for common themes between your pitch and their coverage area. Maybe it\u2019s the next evolution of a story they did previously or a new twist on a topic they are writing on more frequently. It shows you did your homework and we find pays dividends over the long-term. 2) Simplify the process: There is nothing more frustrating than having to go back and forth 10x on email to confirm the availability of a potential source. Always have your facts and materials lined up and your source availability confirmed before you make contact. 3) Time your pitch: You need to walk in the journalist\u2019s shoes. If they are a markets reporter and the Federal Reserve is meeting that day, a pitch other than what the Fed is going to say or do and how the markets may react, will fall on deaf ears. Always be conscious of morning meetings and story deadlines as well before you pitch as it varies by individual and outlet. 4) Send a thank you note: I know this is a 4th suggestion but it\u2019s so important! We are in the relationship building business, but very few people say thank you anymore. Send a brief thank you note after the story or segment runs. They will remember you and that note.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage The best way to ensure you get good media coverage is to have a good story, if there is no story then most editors will be able to see through the pitch and it will be unsuccessful. With that story, you have to be able to get it to the right people and make it stand out. It\u2019s not easy but if you\u2019re pitching the right story in the appropriate media channels then you\u2019ll have much better success. You have to consider the perspective of an editor. An editor is getting a huge volume of emails every day, so it\u2019s a challenge to get your email through, so they see it, and then opened, so they can respond to it. You might not get attention immediately, but if you continue, you will eventually cut through. There is a certain level of patience and persistence that is required to get any coverage at all. Then, when they\u2019re ready they will ask you for more information, at this stage you need to work extremely quickly to ensure you don\u2019t miss the opportunity. Deadlines are part of the business and if you miss them, you won\u2019t get another chance.\n\nJason leads the development of client project strategy for Broadreach Public Relations in Portland, Maine.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1. Write it Yourself: From op-eds to bylined articles, sometimes the best and most effective strategy to earn media coverage is a thought leadership plan. Thought leadership allows you to write (or produce) the story you want published yourself. It not only guarantees the work gets done, but you have control over the message. Outlets are also happy to receive a finished product. It\u2019s more efficient for them. The key therefore becomes the pitch. A good pitch makes the case for why the opinion or insight is qualified and should therefore be published. 2. Keep it Topical: Your earned media success will increase if you can find tie-ins to topical subjects, especially when trying to land coverage in daily outlets that are hyper-focused on what\u2019s going on from one day to the next. Take stock of what is trending in the news or leading newscasts and determine how your product, service, or insight connects to those stories. Does it offer a solution? Reframe the story? Provide additional context? Keep the story alive? Provide a local hook? The connection may not always be obvious, but a good PR professional can think about the entire story globally to determine if a connection exists. Conversely, maybe there isn\u2019t a connection and that\u2019s what is newsworthy. 3. Focus on your headline/subject line: Your headline and/or subject line needs to answer the \u201cwho cares\u201d or \u201cwhy care\u201d question. So many pitches or press releases go out with headlines in various iterations of \u201cX Company Announces Y\u201d. Unless your company is announcing the cure to cancer, that sort of headline is not going tell the reporter who cares or why someone should care. Brands announce things every day, so your headline needs to indicate why this announcement or news is of special significance to an audience \u2014 particularly the outlet\u2019s audience.

Blasting an announcement out to hundreds of reporters is not, and never will be, an effective means of pitching. A personalized approach yields far better results. Just because someone\u2019s beat is \u201ctech\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to care about every single pitch that has some semblance of a tech angle. Do your research to understand the intricacies of a reporter\u2019s beat and craft your pitch to address their interests. They will quickly be able to tell if you\u2019ve done your homework or not. 2) Aim for a balance of quality and quantity. Sure, we all want a lot of press, but we also want the press hits to be meaningful. Are they on message? Does it reach the target audience? What\u2019s the sentiment? It\u2019s worthwhile to look at Google Analytics and see which press hits are referring the most traffic, so future outreach and media coverage can be geared towards targeting outlets that drive results. 3) Planning is key. Resist jumping into a project too soon. It\u2019s vital that you completely understand your client\u2019s business, goals, needs and wants. While clients may expect an immediate ROI, don\u2019t overlook the importance of advanced planning and preparation. Knowing the end destination can help your PR team craft the right messages for media and result in better media coverage.

Since I was producer in the past, I\u2019ve come to learn that it\u2019s important to treat the media as a client, we want to package and serve them relevant stories and deliver what they need, when they need it. A client\u2019s story should be positioned around a cultural trend or social moment, and/or based on a relevant need that you\u2019re able to identify. Once constructed try and align the story with a writer/media outlet who is passionate about that topic. It\u2019s important to see the world through their lens and serve up a narrative that goes beyond just your client\u2019s messaging. Interact with press online. Share their articles and tag them in ones you find interesting. Also, let them know when your client shares their story or segment. It\u2019s important to show appreciation and, like all of us, the media gets satisfaction when their work resonates with audiences. PR is about influence. We influence our media contacts, and those individuals influence their audiences, who themselves influence what media covers in the future. A powerful and effective PR professional knows how to be an ambassador for that news cycle.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 24, Allie started Integrate, one of Houston\u2019s first public relations agencies to \u200bspecialize in social media\u200b.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage Make sure you equip the reporter with everything they might need to write a good story. Don\u2019t let there be any room for questions! What\u2019s key here is not just piling them with textual information \u2014 who would want to sift through all that? Make it seamless and interesting by utilizing multimedia in your pitch: videos, infographics, slideshow of photos, etc. By using visual forms of media to relay information, you make it easier for the reporter to absorb and understand the details, while providing them with media they can actually use in their piece. The less work they have to do, the more likely they are to do the story! It\u2019s PR 101 that you need to personalize your pitch by commenting on a recent story or saying something like, \u201cI know you write about x for x publication.\u201d However, if you want real results, spend the time researching your reporter and don\u2019t be afraid to get personal. Find their personal Instagram or Facebook pages and do some \u201cstalking\u201d to find out their interests, sense of humor, etc. The more you know, the more likely you are to hit it off! If you know they LOVE hamburgers, offer to chat about your pitch idea over lunch (on you) at the newest burger joint. Tip 3: The proof is in the pudding. If you\u2019re pitching your client for a thought leadership piece or a contributed article, provide the reporter with links back to blog posts where your client goes much more in depth on the topic. Letting the reporter see past examples gives them more insight into your idea/topic while also giving proof and reassuring them that your client knows their stuff and can be a credible resource to them. This is also a quick and easy way to jump on a trending news story. Rather than spending the time telling the journalist why they should interview your client, show them they are knowledgeable on the subject by providing links to past thought leadership.\n\nJacqueline Agudelo is an Account Director at N6A.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1. Understand the media landscape: From reading their recent articles to checking out what they have to say on social media, it is important to keep a pulse on what your target reporters are writing / passionate about. Journalists have taken the painstaking effort to be the masters of their craft, and as such, it\u2019s crucial to take the time to be thorough when researching and understanding their beats. 2. Be of service, not a burden: We all want coverage \u201cyesterday,\u201d but the nature of building strong media relationships requires finesse and time. The more you ask of your media contacts, the less they are inclined to work with you on a regular basis. Research your targets carefully and make sure your story angles are of service to their editorial needs and not another burden. 3. Have creative messaging: Reporters are inundated with emails on a daily basis and the last thing they want to see is a rushed, regurgitation of website copy. After you\u2019ve done your media research, tailor your messaging in a creative way. Whether that means looking at seasonal trends or coming up with a spin off angle to a story that feels overdone, provide a fresh perspective on your clients\u2019 messaging to the media. Reporters frequently need to pitch their angles to their editor, so providing them with something unique, that can get the attention of their editor and ultimately their readers, is key.

Build Relationships- Be a great resource for Journalists \u2014 make it easy for them to do their job, and they\u2019ll seek you out as a resource time and again. Share their articles, and make sure to credit them, not just the publication they write for. Do your homework \u2014 know what the media wants, who their audience is and what matters to them, then create great stories that land on the intersection of those three things.

Here Are My Top Strategies To Earn Media Coverage 1) Research: Take time to carefully research and curate your press targets. Go beyond the keyword Cision pulls and familiarize yourself with the outlets you\u2019re pitching. Today, most major media outlets carry a bevy of multimedia options ranging from digital video content, social media activations, podcasts, guest contributor/op-ed features, etc. 2) Engage Your Audience: Move beyond cookie-cutter, one size fits all pitches and make it personal so your recipient knows they\u2019re not on the receiving end of another massive mail merge. Journalists can spot a bland/generic mass email pitch from a mile away. While it is important to keep pitches concise and get to the point, flipping the focus from yourself to the person you\u2019re reaching out to is a good way to keep your audience engaged. Simple techniques like acknowledging a journalist\u2019s coverage beat, establishing a common interest, or highlighting their previous work are just a few ways to grab their attention and avoid the trash folder. 3) Be Flexible: Try not to back yourself into a corner with your pitches. Unless you\u2019re pitching a specific feature story or recurring column, it\u2019s okay to get creative with your ask and include a couple avenues for your client to work within their editorial scope."

        "text": "This article is a response to Tim Urban\u2019s TED talk about procrastination. His basic argument is that the mind can be (metaphorically) divided into three different characters.\n\nThe first is the rational decision-maker.\n\nHe is the one who is supposed to navigate the boat through the stormy sea that is our daily lives. While he is in control, you are taking care of the most important tasks that need to get done right now.\n\nThe problem is, that there is also an instant-gratification monkey, who is always around. It basically annoys the rational decision-maker long enough, until he gives up and hands over control to the monkey.\n\nThe monkey keeps shouting things like:\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon man! One minute of playing the piano. I promise, it will be just one minute!\u201d\n\n\u201cIce cream! Ice cream! Banana flavoured ice cream! NO? Seriously?! Hmpf, okay\u2026 then how about chocolate taste?\u201d\n\nThere is no inherent problem with the fact that the instant-gratification monkey exists. When we don\u2019t have anything that needs to get done, then it\u2019s totally fine to give in to your urges and just do whatever you feel like doing.\n\nProblem is, when it keeps you from doing your work. Especially, when it happens every single day.\n\nSo basically, Tim (the other Tim) says this:\n\nFor people who have deadlines, this whole story often isn\u2019t a problem. When the deadline comes close, then a third character appears out of nowhere \u2014and it\u2019s called the panic monster.\n\nThe panic monster puts the whole system into chaos.\n\nBut eventually, it gets you to put in whatever is necessary and get the work done. Even if it requires you to do an all nighter.\n\nAccording to him, the real problem comes in for people who are self-employed, and who don\u2019t really have any hard deadlines. Without any hard deadlines, the panic monster won\u2019t show up.\n\nAnd they won\u2019t get any work done. Ever.\n\nIn this article, I am going to pick up where Tim left, and talk about what we can do get our work done, even without a harsh deadline to bring out the panic monster.\n\nBut before that, feel free to watch Tim\u2019s Ted talk here down below. It\u2019s super fun to watch and very educating.\n\nYour instant-gratification monkey will love it!"

You have accomplished a lot, you are satisfied by many things but still pulled forward by the untiring anxiety that consumes your every day.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to confess it, but you are exhausted. Every hour of work is less productive than it should be. It\u2019s less fruitful than the one before.\n\nCapturing the entire scope of your ambition is a bit more difficult. You feel out of the moment, out of rythm. And a bit blind.\n\nAfter several struggles with your own ego, and the lurking shame that considering to stop working carries, you finally make a decision.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop for a second.\n\nSo you sit in your living room, or in a park, or if you are like me, on the side of a cool lake, and you tell yourself: for just this moment, for just a second, I am here. Truly. You mute your phone, close your eyes, and hover down.\n\nThere is only the silence.\n\nYou think about where you are, who you are. You breathe slower and slower. The complex predicament of your work is like a three-dimensional projection that you wish to contemplate. It\u2019s an object in front of you. You concentrate in an effort to see it in its entirety. It looks like a network of patterns, embroided in each other.\n\nYou want to fly high above everything, and see what your life looks at a distance. All the different parts coming together to create a picture that, hopefully, you\u2019ll agree with.\n\nAnd as you persevere in this effort, and the wind is breathing fresh in your nostrils, and your shoulders start to melt, you are hit with something.\n\nThat blindness that has been afflicting you is washed away by the cold waters. You are seeing things the way you expected to see them, after a long time. The complex object is finally making sense.\n\nAnd you manage, for some unknown force of destiny, to capture an aspect of it that you never have seen before. A sly connection. A timid symmtery. A solution.\n\nYou focus on it with sweet anticipation. This is a ticket to a journey that could bring you to a new place. You start to ask questions.\n\nWhat does this mean? Why is it relevant? Why am I seeing it now?\n\nYou set out to hunt every fleeting possibility and implications of this idea. The silence is yet again your best friend. And the moment you capture them all, for the first time in forever, you truly feel like you understand everything better.\n\nYou open your eyes. There\u2019s a rush of excitement rising up from the base of your spine. You get up. It\u2019s time to go back into the World now, no time for the lake anymore.\n\nYou quickly sketch down your catch of the day, hurried, afraid that without doing so you\u2019ll lose its complexity.\n\nYou found new meaning in a detail. You found renewed understanding in silence. This is a privilege that you much too often forget, lost in the flamboyance of every day\u2019s action. But this giving gift is always here for you. Mindfulness is door that\u2019s always open.\n\nYou need just find a quiet space."

        "text": "However, Elon Musk seems to rely almost exclusively on cognitive reasoning, and I think that this is a limitation for him. For example, he often mentions conversations that he has (commonly in hot tubs) about the idea that we are living inside a simulation of reality. He uses a form of inductive reasoning to conclude that it\u2019s highly probable that what we experience as reality is actually a simulation inside a recursive nest of simulations. Somewhere, way up in the hierarchy of simulations, say 10,000 levels up, is the root reality. This root reality is the one in which, long ago, a civilization was able to create a virtual reality system so realistic and engrossing that its users became completely immersed inside it and lost connection with their true reality. Inside that virtual reality, they went on to create technology similar to that which entrapped them. This process then repeated recursively, again and again, until we arrived at our current reality. This idea is based on the observation that our own civilization seems to be moving towards such technology, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that this civilization is the first to do so.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that we are not artificial consciousnesses, completely simulated inside any level of the simulation, but instead let\u2019s assume (as Elon seems to believe) that we are the consciousnesses of beings in the root reality peering through layers and layers of simulation: A \u201cnatural\u201d consciousness, instantiated in a real brain looking into a virtual world in which it looks into a virtual world, and so on. In this case, what we bring to this deeply nested virtual world is our consciousness, which is aware. As a longterm and hardcore meditator, I know from personal experience that it\u2019s possible to guide the focus of awareness away from the feed from the senses\u2014whether they are real or simulated\u2014and direct it towards itself. By doing this, it\u2019s possible to draw the consciousness up through those nested layers of simulation all the way back up through the root reality and into the underlying fundamental nature of reality, which is consciousness itself. In this case, it doesn\u2019t matter whether we are in a deep nest of simulations, or if were are in the root reality. We can experience the thing that\u2019s doing the experiencing, and it\u2019s something that the brain in the root reality cannot even comprehend with cognition.\n\nKnowing the fundamental nature of reality experientially is infinitely more satisfying and empowering than being lost in a dry and dead hypothesis about how manifest reality may or may not be configured, no matter how geeky it might be. Not surprisingly, it appears that Elon doesn\u2019t meditate. According to a tweet he posted in February of 2017, he doesn\u2019t even practice transcendental meditation, which is a form of meditation that, although it calms and focuses the mind, does not focus awareness back on itself.\n\nAll of this is to say that I suspect that there is an opportunity for Elon to couple his powerful cognitive abilities with enhanced intuitive abilities honed through clear awareness of his own (our own) consciousness. This would lead to a more balanced life, more satisfying relationships, and more sustainable and effortless success. Cognition grounded in self-awareness is always much less complex and much more effective that ungrounded thought. As with the nested simulation example above, I imagine that, at both Tesla and SpaceX, there are many simple and effective solutions that cut through all the complexity Elon must have introduced with his relatively ungrounded cognition."

        "text": "We are creatures of habit. From the moment we wake up in the morning to the moment we go to sleep at night, we perform multiple tiny habits throughout our entire day. From the morning routine that we have, to the way we perform our hygiene routine, to the way that we speak to people, and even to the thoughts that we have, our habits can either push us to become better people, or pull us to become worse. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to choose our habits wisely. In this week\u2019s Thursday Thoughts, I lay out 5 habits that I believe are crucial to living a happier and more successful life in the long-term. I also cover the most prevalent excuses that I hear as to why people can\u2019t do each one, and why those things are excuses and not actual reasons. I hope you enjoy.\n\n1. Meal-Prepping \u2014 When it comes to meal-prepping, the purpose is to get a better understanding of what you are going to eat during the week. This will decrease the chances that you veer off your diet and go grab a fast-food burger instead due to time constraints. When I speak about meal-prepping, the most used excuse that I hear is that meal-prepping is boring. What people probably imagine is the bodybuilder who cooks dry chicken with plain brown rice and boring broccoli for every single meal, stored in plastic containers just waiting to be microwaved. Actually, meal-prepping is the time to try out new recipes, andeat more creative things. Rather than doing an intense recipe and only making one meal, this is the opportunity to try out new and tasty things. But meal-prepping doesn\u2019t even need to be cooking every single meal for your week at once. Meal-prepping can be as simple as planning out what you will be cooking and eating for each individual meal during the week, just so you know what to expect.\n\n2. Movement \u2014 Some of the many benefits of movement is that it is good for your physical and mental health, your longevity, and your ability to concentrate (along with many other things). When people think of movement and exercise, the biggest excuse is that they don\u2019t have enough time. I imagine that they\u2019re picturing that it will take 10 minutes to get changed, 20 minutes to drive to the gym, a 10 minute warmup, an hour workout, a 10 minute cool-down, some time in the sauna or steam-room, a shower, and the 20 minute drive home. Fortunately, you can get an intense HIIT workout done from the comfort of your own home or neighborhood in as little as five minutes.\n\n3. Reading \u2014 Just as nutrition and exercise are good for the body, reading is time to work on your mind. Reading books is a great way to remain present, and learn new information, or just enjoy a really cool story. Reading can boost creativity, intelligence, and can even reduce stress and inflammation. The biggest excuse that I hear when it comes to people not reading is the fact that \u2018they don\u2019t enjoy it\u2019. My guess is that if you don\u2019t enjoy reading, you\u2019ve only read the books that they forced you to read in high school. There are so many amazing books out there, and even if you only read for 10 minutes or 10 pages a day, you\u2019ll be sure to see some benefits in your life.\n\n4. Sleep \u2014 Sleep is usually thrown to the side as unimportant, when in fact, it\u2019s one of the most important parts of our lives. Poor sleep quality or length can cause a multitude of health issues, both with our body and our mind. Getting proper sleep is so important for long-term health and happiness, and using the excuse \u2018I don\u2019t have time\u2019 is irrelevant. No matter what is going on in your life, sleep should always be a priority. And even if for some reason you can\u2019t make more time for sleep, at least work on improving your sleep quality. You can grab our Better Sleep Blueprint here.\n\n5. Wake Up Early \u2014 Personally, this is my favorite. Waking up early and creating a routine that focuses on you is the best way to set yourself up for a less stressed and more successful day. The average person hits snooze multiple times every morning, and then checks their phone or goes to do something for someone else immediately when they start their day. This causes unneeded stress, and if you were to make even 5 minutes in the morning to relax and focus on yourself, your days would improve tenfold. The most common excuse I hear for this \u2018I\u2019m not a morning person\u2019, and it\u2019s one that I used to use as well. But if you focus on getting better sleep, and focus on creating a consistent routine in the morning, things get a lot easier a lot more quickly. Try it out. And if you\u2019re looking for a place to start, make sure you check out the Early Risers Course."

        "title": "How To Keep A Positive Attitude In a Negative World",
        "text": "How To Keep A Positive Attitude In a Negative World\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I woke up and checked my social media feed or the news and was completely appalled by what I saw. Sometimes it was a political rant, other times it was some horrific tragedy, and other times it was just something someone else said.\n\nWhatever the case, when I put down my smart phone, that negative garbage didn\u2019t leave me, it stayed with me and affected my mood.\n\nStudies have shown that the moods we adopt first thing in the morning typically remain with us all day. If we start out our day in a happy or calm mood, we usually remain in a happy or calm mood all day. Likewise, if we start out our day in a funk, we usually remain in a funk all day, according to research by Rothbard and Wilk.\n\nAlthough I am hesitant to accept just any theory that is out there, I think this one has some legs to it.\n\nFor the past 30 days I decided to give this a try.\n\nEach morning, I didn\u2019t pay any attention to the news (which is always depressing), troll through social media posts (which contain all kinds of garbage), or get into any stressful conversations (which are never a good way to start your day).\n\nI was very intentional to avoid anything that had potential to bring me down.\n\nInstead, I usually read several motivational quotes, listened to a short Bible sermon, or just read from the Bible. Some mornings my wife woke up with me and we talked about our dreams and goals or we did a short devotional together over breakfast. Then on the way to work, I usually listened to an audio book or motivational speaker that I enjoyed (shout out to Zig Ziglar).\n\nI must say that this definitely had an effect on my mood. By the time I got to work I felt great! I was much more resilient and ready to take on just about anything the day threw at me. I remember walking into work on several occasions and getting barraged with \u201ctaskers\u201d or \u201cfires\u201d to put out, but they didn\u2019t really affect my mood. I naturally approached them with more of a \u201cI got this\u201d attitude rather than an \u201coh no, not again\u201d one. I noticed that the positive attitude I cultivated during the morning typically stayed with me for the entire day.\n\nBut, there were some exceptions\u2026\n\nIf I called my wife and she was overly stressed or upset, that really affected my mood. I remember some days going from a high to a very sudden low right after a stressful conversation.\n\nI think my conversations with my wife affected me so much more because I obviously care a lot more about how my wife feels than about how my co-workers or random strangers feel.\n\nBased on this, I would say that starting each day in a positive mood will absolutely help you remain in a positive mood all day; however, when people or things you really care about are involved, this rule will not apply. That stuff will affect your mood anyway.\n\nRegardless, I am convinced that in most cases we can dramatically improve our day simply by cultivating a positive mood in the morning. The best way to do this is to develop a positive morning routine.\n\nSince each of us are different, all of our routines will be a little different; however, here are four principals that I think apply to any situation. They guided me over the past 30 days and I think they can guide you too as you develop a morning routine that works for your situation. To develop a positive morning routine:\n\nBe intentional with the information you take in first thing in the morning. It can be tempting to go straight for your smart phone or device to check what is happening on social media or the news, don\u2019t do it. You are likely to stumble across something that will put you in a slump.\n\nInstead, treasure this time. It is time for you to focus on something that brings you joy. If you love a particular podcast or audio book listen to that. Spend some time dreaming or talking about goals with your loved ones. Or, just take some time for yourself while you drink a cup of coffee. Whatever it is, make sure it is intentional so that you are in control of what you invite into your morning.\n\nGratitude is often the best medicine. If you find yourself stressed or overwhelmed with things going on in your life, stop and reflect on what you are thankful for. No matter your situation, there is always something to be thankful for.\n\nWhen you shift your mindset onto what you truly appreciate, you will begin to appreciate everything just a little bit more. I remember several times being frustrated with a particular situation, but instead of focusing on that, I began to remind myself of things I could appreciate about that situation. This really worked! It had a dramatic effect on my mood and transformed my entire outlook.\n\nTake time to just be still. Before your mind is overheated by the demands of the day or swimming in a sea of notifications and emails, enjoy a moment of solitude. This can be time to commune with God in prayer or just to pause in meditation.\n\nIt seams that we live in a culture of constant stimuli. We are barraged with advertisements, notifications, tasks, and a multitude of activities each day that seem to fill every moment. We were not made to function like this. If we were called \u201chuman doings\u201d we could just \u201cdo\u201d \u201cdo\u201d \u201cdo\u201d and never get burnt out. But, both you and I know that is not the case. We do get burnt out. Practicing stillness is the best way to find balance in this and there is no better time than at the beginning of each day.\n\nAll of us enjoy looking forward to something. Find something worth striving for that gives you joy and set a goal to achieve it. This will inspire you and give you purpose. To go through life without goals is like setting out on a journey with no destination. When the journey gets hard \u2014and believe me it will at some point \u2014 your goals will help you persevere and carry you forward. Cultivate belief in your goals and remind yourself of them each morning. This will make the hard times in your life easier and the good times more rewarding because you will have a greater \u201cwhy\u201d driving you forward."

        "title": "On Trusting Autonomous Vehicles: The Tech Behind The Hype",
        "text": "In March 2018, when a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian in Arizona, all hell broke loose. The public and media reacted dramatically, putting the autonomous vehicle industry under more stress, scrutiny and criticism than ever before. To some, this reaction might appear justified. But in reality, more than 90% of car crashes in the U.S. involve some form of human error, whereas self-driving vehicles are designed to decrease road accidents.\n\nNonetheless, the incident has given rise to some important ethical and practical issues that surround automation and advancements in artificial intelligence. A driverless world is an inevitable part of our future, and it will benefit us immensely in the long-run. But as we approach this future, people are bound to wonder about the extent to which we can trust autonomous, connected vehicles. To answer this, some questions that we need to address are: what is the technology that makes self-driving cars so intelligent? How will law enforcement deal with incidents and accidents involving autonomous vehicles? How can we be sure that the autonomous vehicle industry will reduce the number of accidents? Can we truly, wholly, trust autonomous vehicles?\n\nToday, even though trusted tech giants like Google, Uber and Tesla are knee-deep in the AV industry, only about 26% of consumers say they would purchase a self-driving vehicle.\n\nThe main barrier seems to be trust, which is likely to slow the rate of adoption even as self-driving technology accelerates. As the number of AVs grows, consumer confidence and expectations will play an important role in determining how quickly they are adopted.\n\nWhile companies like Google and Uber initiated the transition to a driverless world, several startups have been involved in producing and testing self-driving cars. In the first quarter of 2017 alone, investors poured about $1.4 billion into startups in that space because of the promising potential the industry provides. For the most part, self-driving cars from both new and established companies have well made it through safety tests. However, a small percentage of these tests have resulted in accidents, including a fatal 2016 crash in which a Tesla\u2019s autopilot failed to notice a white tractor-trailer against the bright sky. The Tesla accident, too, incited a wave of scrutiny and frenzy, causing even technology experts to turn around and say that self-driving systems are still far from perfect.\n\nBut like any other exponential trend, the technology that drives AVs is getting increasingly sophisticated by the minute. The same companies that are investing billions of dollars into testing self-driving cars are doing a phenomenal job of bringing us closer to a future where these vehicles rarely fail. Even amidst the controversy around AVs, the intent of the industry is to avoid human error on the road, free up drivers to increase productivity, reduce the number of fatal car accidents, and alleviate the fatigue that often plagues human drivers. Once the technology is perfected, the benefits will be transformative.\n\nThe Technology Behind It All\n\nMany people have a limited understanding of how exactly autonomous vehicles work, making it difficult to trust the industry. But in truth, AVs are designed for safety as they run on reliable, trusted, and connected systems that are constantly being tested and re-tested.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle, or \u201cconnected car\u201d, is essentially a data center on wheels. Cloud-based infrastructure, management and networking technologies are fundamental in the transition to driverless vehicles. Thanks to advancements in cloud technology, the connected car can interact and communicate over multiple network layers \u2014 and that is exactly what makes it so reliable. To achieve near-perfect levels of autonomy and reliability, all self-driving cars will employ some combination of sensors, cameras, high performance GPS, AI and Machine Learning.\n\nThe various aspects and layers of the cloud make autonomous vehicles far more reliable than human drivers. An autonomous vehicle needs to collect and process vast amounts of data in real-time to be responsive to changing conditions as well as to random events on the road \u2014 like a pedestrian crossing. It needs to be able to shift lanes, assess how other cars on the road move, and react accordingly \u2014 all within a split second. A scalable, highly reliable cloud-based infrastructure can process this large-scale data, which is how AVs are being safely tested. But what really ties it together and makes it the solution for the future is the fact that AVs are run by an intelligent cloud-based management system and network that can aggregate, analyze and respond to data in real time.\n\nAn advanced cloud infrastructure and internal management system is the first step to making the driverless world a trusted norm. It\u2019s clear that we need infrastructure and data management that secures and manages the flow of data.\n\nBut the power of the cloud will allow us to go beyond just processing and managing the internal data and systems for each vehicle: it will pave the path for vehicle to vehicle communication. Cloud networking is a key aspect of the driverless industry that allows vehicles to constantly interact with each other and respond in real time. This constant machine to machine communication ensures safety on the road and will increase urban efficiency by improving traffic flow.\n\nIn fact, according to the World Economic Forum, traditional telecommunication companies like AT&T have already identified the value in machine to machine communications and are focusing on connecting more new vehicles as opposed to selling new smartphones. With secure cloud networks, cars will be able to communicate with each other, letting them learn from other vehicles and making adjustments that account for external changes like a detour or harsh weather.\n\nBut to go above and beyond that, imagine if vehicles could talk not just with each other, but also with roadside infrastructure. Sensors on the road, traffic lights, bridges and parking lots will create an integrated cloud-based communication network of continually moving digital information. This connected solution will not only increase safety and improve traffic flow, but it will also free us up to use time spent on the road in a more productive, creative, and satisfying way.\n\nWhen we consider a future in which every car on the road is connected and driving is fully automated via the cloud, it\u2019s easy to jump to the dystopian conclusion that driverless cars will put close to 5 million truckers, cabbies and other drivers out of work. The immediate threat to jobs is a reality that we need to confront. One solution to the job loss from automation is Universal Basic Income.\n\nHowever, in the long run, AVs could be profoundly beneficial to society in various ways. To offset the several jobs that the driverless world will destroy, it will create many new, exciting ones. These new jobs are likely to involve more human interaction or creativity. For instance, new companies will emerge that provide customer service for AVs or that analyze and process the large amounts of data extracted from AVs. Similarly, as more companies enter the AV industry, jobs will open up to design, innovate, program and further automate vehicles for the future.\n\nWhen discussing the implications of a driverless world, many technology enthusiasts and experts suggest that self-driving cars will give rise to a \u201cPassenger Economy\u201d in which individuals will dedicate the time that they spend driving into creating new products and services for society. These products and services could add $7 trillion to the global economy. With the advent of AVs, time spent driving can be used by the individual for productivity, creativity and innovation, or even for other enjoyable tasks that increase happiness \u2014 like reading, writing, or watching TV.\n\nWhen AVs go mainstream, three important things will happen: drivers will have more time for everything, parking will become easier, and accident rates will dramatically drop. It\u2019s clear that the rise of autonomous, connected vehicles will have a profound impact not only on the automobile industry, but on society in general. The only barrier that we are likely to face to fully adopting autonomous vehicles is consumer trust. But if advancements in technology over the past few decades have taught us anything, it\u2019s that automation is far better for us than we think."

        "text": "This piece in yesterday\u2019s Daily Stoic newsletter struck me like a physical blow.\n\nIt made me realise that we spend so much time in the pursuit of some vague sense of freedom that we never stop to quantify it or define it very clearly.\n\nIn the startup world particularly, many of us find purpose in our work. We dedicate ourselves to a mission \u2014 maybe we want to improve the world, to make money, to enjoy ourselves along the way.\n\nThis represents freedom in the sense that we are able to define & pursue our own goals in life.\n\nYet we rarely delve deeper into the superficial assumptions defining such goals.\n\nWhen we enjoy working at a company, what does that enjoyment constitute?\n\nWhen we feel a sense of purpose. Why?\n\nWhen we just want to make money. What\u2019s the ulterior motive?\n\nSeth Godin, the Dalai Lama of the marketing & business world, rightly points out that there is always a base need underlying our actions.\n\nWhen we want to make money, for example, it\u2019s not that we need the money.\n\nEndless academic studies (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s work on positive psychology being most notable) show that, once our basic needs are met, wealth does not increase our well-being.\n\nTherefore why do we continue to pursue wealth?\n\nBecause of status. Because of the need to belong. To be respected. To be looked up to within a certain community.\n\nIt\u2019s a basic animal instinct: that need for one\u2019s place in a community.\n\nBut in the pursuit of such primal urges (for sex, for status, for dopamine) we sometimes find ourselves trapped, heading further and further away from true freedom in happiness.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this in my own life.\n\nI started a business at university to take control of my own life & avoid the monotony of a cubicle job. To travel. To create a unique company culture. To work with people I loved spending time with. To make my own decisions.\n\nBut the status. The magazine features. The valuations. It all distracts you from the vision you started out with and leaves you questioning why you even started.\n\nIf the trappings of wealth, of status, of expectation, of obligation prevent us from feeling free, then what is the point?\n\nThese forces are insidious. They coat our lives with a residue that is difficult to identify \u2014 one that gradually builds up over the years.\n\nYet we must strive to wipe away this sediment from our lives and re-focus our efforts around the pursuit of true freedom.\n\nThat is freedom from anxiety.\n\nFreedom from stress.\n\nFreedom from negativity.\n\nFreedom from triviality.\n\nFrom purposelessness.\n\nFrom expectation & obligation.\n\nTrue freedom is to pursue what makes you truly happy, giving no regard to the whimsical opinion of others, without benchmarking your life against others.\n\nTrue freedom is spending your time doing only what make you feel a sense of fulfilment in life.\n\nDo not lose hope like Layne Staley, the author of those lyrics, in the face of adversity.\n\nThe only advice that is worth giving is simple:\n\nFight, as an earlier part of the song suggests, to pursue what freedom really means for you."

        "title": "Global Public Health: Blockchain for Contagious Disease Relief",
        "text": "Blockchain as a helping hand during the global public health crisis.\n\nHealthcare leaders around the world have been concerned about \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d. World health organization (WHO) organized an international technical consultation on \u201cCities and Public Health crises\u201d in Lyon, France, on 29\u201330 October 2008.\n\nThe public health crisis is caused by Pandemics to the impacts of obesity. Out of many causes of the health crisis, one of the prominent cause is Pandemics. Pandemics are outbreaks of global disease. These Pandemic threats cannot be solved, and diagnosing symptoms may only occur after an individual is already infected.\n\nCrisis management is one of the major problem faced during outbreaks. Crisis management in a city must be coordinated outside between the municipal and national or state authorities and inside between the services that provide health care and those that provide emergency response, as well as with public amenities such as transport services, airport and port authorities, tourism, industry, education, commerce, and the media. A structure for coordinated effort amongst national and neighborhood experts in the midst of emergency must be produced in advance to maintain a strategic distance from perplexity.\n\nOther problems are dealing with patients on a large scale by medical staff for the first time and if the disease is unknown, there must be rapid and effective diagnostic services at hand. In addition, hospital supplies may rapidly be exhausted and plans for accessing extra stocks of medical equipment must be at hand. The problems that arise from a public health crisis will vary from place to place according to the nature of the emergency and the readiness of the city administration to deal with it. One of the most common problems faced during that time is receiving the cure information. Many poor countries due to the lack of resources don\u2019t get access to the cure of infectious disease.\n\nIf a person is diagnosed as having a dangerous disease transmitted from person to person, one of the first steps is to trace the people with whom the patient has had contact. In a large city with mass transit systems, crowded sidewalks, and busy entertainment venues, this is hardly possible. If it is to be attempted it will require specially designed databases, reliable maps (even of slum areas), and three-dimensional projections of high-rise areas where people live at different levels.\n\nSolutions to crisis management must be found in advance. Plans should be ready to mobilize medical staff from other places to provide health care in appointed facilities at a time of crisis. Having a patient\u2019s data with outbreak investigators are best resolved before a crisis occurs\n\nDistributed ledgers could help public health workers respond faster to the health crisis.\n\nAs per Nasr \u2014 \u201cPublic Health and blockchain really do belong together. During the outbreak of contagious disease crisis, moving the data from the source to destination in a secure manner, in a compliant manner, and in a transparent manner \u2014 as quickly as possible \u2014 can be achieved through Blockchain\u201d\n\nBlockchains, similar to those that underlie Bitcoin and different digital currencies, are maintained by distributed networks \u2014 that verify each transaction and record it in a essentially ethical, encrypted ledger shared by all the computers in the network.\n\nWhile singular associations in the public healthcare system share a similar general mission, currently the information sharing mechanism passes through a sequence of a chain in which government privacy rules decide whom can access and modify information. That delay thing down. Some of extra, now and then manual procedures are expected to ensure the right association or individual sent or got the correct information, and that it was utilized accurately. A blockchain can automate these procedures.\n\nA fierce pandemic or the revelation of new infection requires making a move quickly and along these lines depends on a limit of sharing urgent information in an auspicious way. The 2014 Ebola emergency demonstrated the insufficiencies of the framework when a few contaminated people were permitted back in the US in light of the fact that the government did not get data about their health status on time. Due to the deficiency in healthcare data and lack of information on how to cure Ebola, there was a rapid rise of Ebola cases and death rate.\n\nEstonia is maybe the best case of an extensive scale reception of blockchain innovation in the healthcare field. 1.5 million Estonian advantages from completely digitalized medical records upheld by an across the nation well-being data framework. From lab results to remedies or therapeutic arrangements, Estonian individuals can approach all their medical history and offer it to the medicinal group. The framework likewise enables a person to see who got the information and in this manner control consents.\n\nThe Estonian healthcare frameworks work on a consent blockchain whose performing artists are characterized by the state. This design targets three fundamental objectives: create autonomous and legitimately solid confirmations of record, find and report unapproved changes and manufacture an adaptable framework for over a million people.\n\nIn Estonia, the state possesses the safe databases that store the medical information and that information is available to the therapeutic and scientific group unless the individual says something else. Subsequently, the data can be utilized for general wellbeing contemplations, for example, following the development of a sickness, fabricate prescient models or receive strategies.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention, some portion of the U.S. Division of Health and Human Services, is wagering on a blockchain-based answer for enhancing information accumulation, examination and sharing at a government level. The CDC has collaborated together with IBM to manufacture a system of performing artists including healthcare organizations or doctor\u2019s facilities. The goal is to enhance cooperation through secure, consistent and straightforward information trade frameworks.\n\nEpidemiology and Public Health in the Age of Blockchain.\n\nTrust is the key component to any cooperation, particularly with regards to wellbeing information. The therapeutic and scientific researchers need to guarantee that the healthcare data they get is reliable. This feature is built by design in a blockchain architecture. In a general wellbeing setting, confide in the source or the utilization of the information is fundamental. Public Health foundations need to ensure that they get precise and finish information while patients need to guarantee that their data is utilized with their assent.\n\nAs being a decentralized and distributed ledger, blockchain enables a gathering of free performing artists to share advanced resources and data without involving any third party. Each and every transactions or data exchanged will get registered on a distributed ledger. There is no central entity controlling the transactions. Each new data added to the record is in this way approved by consensus of the system.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has additionally declared its goal to fuse blockchain into a support of offer information on the spread of contagious diseases, with the expectation that blockchain will give a powerful method to guarantee the data from a disease outbreak reaches the required individuals so as to control the spread of the infection as fast as possible.\n\nAnother utilization of blockchain is in worldwide general public health, for the efficient, immediate, directed conveyance of help like aid funds stores for provisions on account of emergencies like Ebola and different infectious malady breakouts. Traditional keeping money streams hamper the promptness of help conveyance in emergency circumstances, rather than Bitcoin, which can be conveyed instantly to particular freely auditable trackable locations. Individual peer-to-peer aid and institutional aid could be contributed by means of Bitcoin. In developing markets (frequently with cellphone infiltration or 70 percent or higher) there are various SMS Bitcoin wallets and conveyance components, for example, 37Coins and Coinapult, and tasks, for example, Kipochi that are incorporated with generally utilized portable fund stages like M-Pesa (in Kenya, for instance, 31 percent of the GDP is spent through versatile phones). Applications could be developed on contagious disease tracking sites like Healthmap and Flu Tracker in which an extra functionality of Bitcoin donation can be added or remunerative app coin more generally.\n\nBlockchain innovation is related to a reward idea that boosts individuals to take an interest in the system. These prizes are regularly appeared by tokens that can be granted to people that demonstrate an ethical conduct. Such conduct can be the regard of set principles or the level of cooperation. With regards to wellbeing information, there are those that need it and those that claim or deliver it. Beginning from this straightforward perception, it ought to be conceivable to execute a reward framework to boost individuals to impart their information to those that need it.\n\nOne proposed solution \u2014 Dapps can be built on storing the cure information of Doctors and biomedical researchers integrated with disease tracking sites. Doctors and biomedical researchers who were active during the time of crisis and successfully found the cure of the disease can store their information on Blockchain distributed ledger to share with others in need. Blockchain provides an uttermost security, therefore, every information that the doctor will upload first get verified. Being a distributed ledger any local medical institution or even an individual can access this information and in return, the doctors will get tokens or Bitcoin as a reward. A new block will be added only after validating each transaction. So even if a person suffering from epidemic is sitting in the corner of the world can get access to its cure with blockchain.\n\nEven those patients who successfully went through the curing process during the time of crisis can share their cure process if they are willing to do so. The Doctors who successfully operated on that patient can also share his prescribed medical process. Talking about the privacy concerns of the patient, Doctors are considered as the public figures hence there is no illegal term, harm or privacy concern in sharing doctor\u2019s research data.\n\nThe above image shows a Doctor\u2019s Database Dapp in which the research data and cure data of different Doctors who successfully proposed treatment to the outbreak disease are stored.\n\nPeople always deliver a wide range of information and part of this data can be significant to general wellbeing foundations. Nonetheless, it is frequently hard to gather the data from a patient and offer it with his/her assent. This issue could be tended to by making a token that would remunerate patients when they share their restorative data. Public healthcare associations could be the ones making and dealing with the token appropriation as per set measures codes into shrewd contracts. This token could a short time later be utilized by patients to pay for therapeutic administrations.\n\nIt is still early in the game.\n\nBefore any of these concepts can become real applications, there are still some questions that need to be answered. Due to currently existing complexities surrounding data ownership and governance structure for healthcare data exchange between public-private entities \u2014 however, it would be difficult to replicate the Estonian scenario globally. There are a number of obstacles facing this potential innovation.\n\n\u201cSo when a person has a very rare condition, if you can find a way to give a remedial expert that exists in another nation access to that information remotely, you begin to open up a more expansive global healthcare system that empowers individual to reach the correct doctor or the correct cure at the right time.\u201d \u2014 For me, this could be a game changer.\n\n1.

        "title": "What Gets Scheduled Gets Done \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "In yesterday\u2019s post, I shared the simple formula of time management.\n\nI explained the analysis and prioritization steps in yesterday\u2019s post. Today\u2019s post will be about the third step, scheduling.\n\nBy scheduling, I mean the planning of day-to-day activities. Technically, scheduling is assigning a date and time to an activity. Sometimes, I assign a specific time to an activity, for example, in case of an appointment.\n\nIn other times, I indicate the order of the action items, without indicating specific start and end times. This order usually matches the priority of the action item, but not necessarily so.\n\nIn some cases, I might have an appointment early in the morning and a more important task in the afternoon.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you how much detail you want to include in your scheduling. I prefer to plan only critical and important tasks in my day-to-day schedule. Check yesterday\u2019s post for what I mean by critical and important tasks.\n\nBy including only critical and important tasks, my daily plan doesn\u2019t get crowded. I can quickly see the top 4\u20135 essential actions I have to take on that day. On some days, I go over 5, but 4\u20135 essential tasks seem ideal to me.\n\nIn the past, I used a to-do list app. I added every idea that crossed my mind as a to-do item to that list. As a result, I ended up with thousands of action items. The critical and important action items got lost among the \u201cnice to-do\u2019s\u201d and \u201cone day, I\u2019ll do\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI stopped mixing my casual ideas and high-priority tasks. I add my casual ideas to a separate note in Evernote.\n\nThe Tool that I Use for Scheduling\n\nThe app that I use the most is Evernote. I use it for scheduling as well.\n\nI like the flexibility of a note. I can structure and format it any way I want. I can combine several notes together with the internal link functionality. Here are some of the features that make Evernote an excellent scheduling tool for me.\n\nThe goal of scheduling is to plan predetermined activities over days. If you wonder how I identify and prioritize my activities, you can check yesterday\u2019s post.\n\nI make a distinction between two types of activities.\n\nRepetitive activities repeat themselves one or multiple times every week, every month, every quarter, and every year. I use templates to plan my repetitive activities.\n\nI include the quarterly activities in the monthly template.\n\nA template is a simple note that contains the repetitive activities to be carried out in a given time frame. For example, a yearly template includes the following items.\n\nThose are the events and actions that happen once a year. I divide the yearly template into twelve months. The formatting functionality of Evernote is perfect for doing that. Similarly, I divide the weekly template into seven weekdays.\n\nI create an actual schedule before the related period starts. I create a note for the next year, the next month, and next week, before they start. That is really simple with the \u201cduplicate a note\u201d functionality.\n\nThe \u201cduplicate a note\u201d functionality creates a copy of the note, in this case, our template note. Then, I adjust the title of the note to the related year, month, or week, and that\u2019s it. For the week, I use the start and end date of the week as the title.\n\nOnce I duplicate a template note, I have the repetitive tasks in my note. Then, I add the one-off tasks to the period note.\n\nHow Long Does It Take?\n\nOnce you have the analysis, prioritization, and templates ready, it takes around 10\u201315 minutes to create a weekly plan.\n\nIt takes more time to prepare the analysis, prioritization, and templates. Those tasks are never complete.\n\nYour analysis, prioritization, and templates change with your priorities. You need to invest time in those activities to keep up with the priorities of your life.\n\nHow do I Create an Actual Schedule?\n\nI work on scheduling once a week on Sunday. I complete all the scheduling work in 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nOnce those notes are ready, I move specific action items from the year note to the month note, and from the month note to the week note. Then, I add one-off activities to the week note. After that step, my weekly schedule is complete.\n\nFor example, \u201cbring the car to maintenance\u201d is a specific action item. \u201cThink about buying a new car\u201d isn\u2019t. Vague plans have to be analyzed, made concrete, and prioritized in the analysis and prioritization phases.\n\nIn addition to my year, month, and week notes, I have a long-term note. Don\u2019t confuse the long-term note with a long-term vision or any other abstract idea. Those ideas go to the analysis document.\n\nThe long-term note contains the action items that have a deadline that\u2019s after the end of the next year. For example, I have to renew my password and id every five to ten years.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThere aren\u2019t many options to order notes in Evernote. As a result, you end up with a bunch of notes without any logical order. I create an index note to overcome that problem.\n\nEvery time, I create a new year, month, or week note, I add that note to my index note. This is really easy in Evernote with the \u201ccopy internal link\u201d functionality. Then, I paste the link to the index note.\n\nThe index note and the template notes are important notes. I add a shortcut to them on the left panel.\n\nThe Order of Tasks in a Day\n\nAs I mentioned before, I don\u2019t assign timeslots to tasks in a day. The only exception to that is the appointments with set start and end times.\n\nI plan the tasks without set start times according to their priority. The higher priority a task has, the earlier it is scheduled.\n\nHaving a set order of tasks has several benefits.\n\nThe Impact of Planning on Your Life\n\nI included the quote above because I like the idea behind it. I don\u2019t agree with it 100%.\n\nIn the past, I got lost in details and kept planning. As a result, I lost a lot of time planning without getting much work done.\n\nAs the years past, I learned to focus on the most critical and important tasks and let go of the rest when planning.\n\nI discussed the analysis and prioritization in yesterday\u2019s post and scheduling in today\u2019s post.\n\nWhen scheduling, I focus only on the most essential, specific tasks. I order my tasks according to their priorities if they don\u2019t have set start times, like appointments.\n\nI use Evernote to create my day-to-day schedules. It has several features that make creating and using a day-to-day plan efficient.\n\nYou have to go through the steps explained in yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s post to see what it does for you and your life. Work on setting it up for a month and use it for a month. See the effects yourself.\n\nMost of us make the mistake of equating time management to planning. Planning is only half of the equation. The other half is willpower.\n\nStay tuned for a post on the willpower aspect of time management. That post won\u2019t be the average motivational post shouting at you to get things done. I\u2019ll back it up with some mind hacks that you can use right away.\n\nDo you have any questions or feedback over the system explained in yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s posts? Let me know in the comments. I\u2019ll do my best to answer your questions and write a follow-up post if necessary."

        "title": "Sometimes You Have to Check the Fuck Out \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Sometimes You Have to Check the Fuck Out\n\nSometimes the very best, productive thing you can do is slow down, take a break, and let life work itself out.\n\nWhile all of those have merit, I\u2019m not buying into them at face value anymore.\n\nI used to take pride in never checking out, in never ever taking a break from my full-time job or side hustles. I would work incessantly \u2014 regardless of what was going on in my life \u2014 whether it be a sick family member or even going through my divorce.\n\nThere is no point in crushing your goals if you\u2019re too exhausted and emotionally drained to celebrate and enjoy once you make it. It\u2019s way more fruitful to play the long game and prioritize your mental and physical health.\n\nWhat does it matter if your dreams come true if you\u2019re too burnt out to enjoy them?\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I am the biggest champion of a consistently strong day in and day out work ethic, and I do believe that you have to work relentlessly to manifest your big dreams \u2014 but never at the risk of your own health.\n\nI admit, it has been difficult to put this into practice.\n\nI prefer to run full force ahead on all fronts of my life \u2014 but with my recent relocation to London (from New York City) for work, I had to prioritize and cut out everything unnecessary for survival while I took on the daunting task of moving to another country.\n\nI have not posted on Medium in well over a month, and I paused all side hustle work I was doing. I checked out on social media, and chose just one app to share my adventures on. I hated to lose momentum, but I had to embrace, love, and fully experience this crazy phase of my life instead of just hustling through it.\n\nIt was difficult to let go, and I have definitely felt guilty letting messages, texts, emails, and comments pile up unanswered \u2014 but I\u2019d rather feel guilty than burnt out and barely able to function, or resentful when I\u2019m doing those tasks, because that won\u2019t do anyone any good.\n\nNow I\u2019m feeling better, rested, settled, eager, and antsy to get going on shit again. Making the conscious decision to allow myself to check the fuck out for as long as I mentally and emotionally needed during this move granted me the grace to love and accept myself however I felt that day, and prioritize sleep and meditation above all else to keep sane and happy.\n\nDo not be afraid to check the fuck out if you have to.\n\nIt does not make you weak.\n\nIt does not make you lazy.\n\nPrioritizing self care is never the wrong decision.\n\nMeditation and solid rest will allow you to come back stronger and more creative than ever before.\n\nYou will be able to pick up where you left off, and you\u2019ll be even more exceptional than you were before."

        "title": "My Time In San Francisco \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Whenever someone asks me about San Francisco, I think of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. These are amazing places to spend your time, but there are many more places to explore. At Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, you can bark at some sea lions at Pier 39. While you\u2019re there, make sure to try a bread bowl of clam chowder and eat a Dungeness crab.\n\nAlcatraz exceeded my expectation. Its audio tour is world class and you get magnificent views of San Francisco from the water. The Golden Gate Bridge is overwhelming and mysterious when it\u2019s foggy. Go under the bridge to get an amazing view.\n\nTalking about views, if you want some amazing outlooks on San Francisco, Coit Tower, Twin Peaks and Alamo Square are the places to be.\n\nVia Filbert Street, find your way up the Coit Tower and if luck is on your side, you can see or hear flocks of wild colourful parrots that make their home there. For some magic, go to Twin Peaks at sunset and watch the city shine as the sun reflects off on the financial district. Oh, don\u2019t forget to make your way to Alamo Square and see the contrast of the 1890s painted ladies Victorians and San Francisco\u2019s breath-taking skyline.\n\nWhen the sun shines brightly over San Francisco, put on a pair of sneakers because you need to go to Dolores Park to start a walking tour. From there, walk down Valencia Street all the way to 24th Street, you will see the remaining elements of a once fully Hispanic and Latin American neighbourhood in the hardship of gentrification. The beauty and grit of this area have not disappeared, and the murals and street art are as lively as ever.\n\nGolden Gate Park is a great place to explore, especially on a Sunday as it\u2019s somewhat closed to car traffic. It has everything and more, from roller disco to lawn bowling. On Thursday nights, experience Nightlife at the Academy of Sciences to while enjoying a drink inside of an epic museum watching the cosmos or maybe befriend a gorilla.\n\nOf course, let\u2019s not forget farmers market specifically on Saturday mornings at the Ferry Building. Have a chat with the local farmers, enjoy the food, and much more.\n\nLet me know if you want more intel on places to explore in San Francisco."

        "text": "Ezgi: On behalf of all citizens of the World, I wish you all a convivial welcome. We are going to have an insightful and enjoyable time together. There are lots of opinions out there when it comes to the AI and all of you expressed your view in response to the question \u201cWhat do you think will happen to human civilization with further development in AI technology?\u201d. Only time will tell which predictions will be closest to the reality. Future is not what it used to be and who will be the best to predict it as we teach machines to think like human?\n\nStephen: We spend a great deal of time studying history which, let\u2019s face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it\u2019s a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence.\n\nAI research is now progressing rapidly. The achievements we have seen so far will surely pale against what the coming decades will bring. The potential benefits are huge; everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools that AI may provide, but the eradication of war, disease, and poverty would be high on anyone\u2019s list. Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.\n\nUnfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks. There are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved: there is no physical law precluding particles from being organized in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains.\n\nOne can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand. Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.\n\nEzgi: Stephen, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future?\n\nStephen: I fear that AI may replace humans altogether. If people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that improves and replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that outperforms humans. The real risk with AI isn\u2019t malice but competence. A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\u2019t aligned with ours, we\u2019re in trouble.\n\nYet, I am an optimist and I believe that we can create AI for the good of the world. That it can work in harmony with us. We simply need to be aware of the dangers, identify them, employ the best possible practice and management, and prepare for its consequences well in advance.\n\nSo, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilization sent us a message saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll arrive in a few decades,\u201d would we just reply, \u201cOK, call us when you get here \u2014 we\u2019ll leave the lights on\u201d? Probably not \u2014 but this is more or less what is happening with AI. Although we are facing potentially the best or worst thing to happen to humanity in history, little serious research is devoted to these issues outside non-profit institutes such as the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, the Future of Humanity Institute, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and the Future of Life Institute. All of us should ask ourselves what we can do now to improve the chances of reaping the benefits and avoiding the risks.\n\nSundar: I am an optimist, too. AI is probably the most important thing humanity has ever worked on. I think of it as something more profound than electricity or fire. Any time you work with technology, you need to learn to harness the benefits while minimizing the downsides. AI could be used to help solve climate change issues, or to cure cancer. I acknowledge that people have a right to be concerned, but still need to embrace technological advances. History shows that countries that pull back don\u2019t do well with change. So you have to embrace the change.\n\nGrowing up, I didn\u2019t have a phone for a while, I waited five years. We got a telephone, it fundamentally changed our lives\u2026We waited a long time to get a refrigerator, too, and I saw how my mom\u2019s life changed: she didn\u2019t need to cook every day, she could spend more time with us. So there is a side of me that has viscerally seen how technology can make a difference, and I still feel it. I feel the optimism and energy, and the moral imperative to accelerate that progress. I remember the joys of technology and I think that will be true for AI. It\u2019s important for us to explain that and bring the world along with us. I recognize that, in the Valley, people are obsessed with the pace of technological change. It\u2019s tough to get that part right\u2026 We rush sometimes, and can misfire for an average person. As humans, I don\u2019t know whether we want change that fast \u2014 I don\u2019t think we do.\n\nThe risks are important, and international cooperation on the scale of the Paris climate agreement should be put in place to manage them. Countries need to demilitarize AI, that\u2019s a common goal countries should work towards. It is super-important that humanity figures out more global cooperative frameworks to solve problems. No single company or country can change the pace of progress.\n\nEzgi: Ginni, people may not know that IBM doesn\u2019t call it AI. You call it \u201ccognitive computing.\u201d Tell us why that is.\n\nGinni: I have actually had to explain this to my husband as well, because he said to me, \u201cGinni, of all words, why cognitive?\u201d It was really a very thoughtful decision. The world calls it AI. There\u2019s so much fearmongering about AI. When we started over a decade ago, the idea was to help you and I make better decisions amid cognitive overload. That\u2019s what has always led us to cognitive. If I considered the initials AI, I would have preferred augmented intelligence. It\u2019s the idea that each of us are going to need help on all important decisions.\n\nEzgi: Please allow me to ask you 2 questions: First, what does Watson mean for the future of AI?\n\nSecond, it is still too dependent on humans, it can\u2019t learn fast enough, and it hasn\u2019t been transformational enough to live up to some of the expectations both of IBM and how it\u2019s being marketed. How do you respond to those critics?\n\nGinni: Everything you know until today is programmable \u2014 an entire era for decades has been programmable. Watson would be the beginning of a new era where you didn\u2019t program. Machines would look at data, understand, reason over it, and they continue to learn: understand, reason and learn, not program, in my simple definition. That to us is a very big difference between what you might experience in what I call consumer AI \u2014 that is, general purpose \u2014 vs. business. We set out to build an AI platform for business. AI would be vertical. You would train it to know medicine. You would train it to know underwriting of insurance. You would train it to know financial crimes. Train it to know oncology. Train it to know weather. And it isn\u2019t just about billions of data points. In the regulatory world, there aren\u2019t billions of data points. You need to train and interpret something with small amounts of data.\n\nWatson is exactly where we thought it would be. When we did our very first oncology teaching with Watson \u2014 the very first was lung, breast, and colon cancer \u2014 it took the doctors a year to train Watson.\n\nDoctors don\u2019t want black-and-white answers, nor does any profession. If you\u2019re a professional, my guess is when you interact with AI, you don\u2019t want it to say, \u201cHere is an answer.\u201d What a doctor wants is, \u201cOK, give me the possible answers. Tell me why you believe it. Can I see the research, the evidence, the \u2018percent confident\u2019? What more would you like to know?\u201d\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was one of the first that taught Watson. It\u2019s the gold standard, and it illustrates beautifully one of the principles of AI in the future. You must know who taught it and what data is in it \u2014 and you must be transparent about it because that matters in these decisions. That gives you a long, long, long answer, but this is why I\u2019m so positive this world will have more really tough problems solved with AI.\n\nEzgi: Demis, you are the cofounder and CEO of Google DeepMind. You invented the first computer program to defeat a world champion at the ancient Chinese game of Go, an intuitive game in which generally computers are not great at, a game which is the pinnacle of games, and the richest in terms of intellectual depth. AlphaGo Zero is even more powerful and is arguably the strongest Go player in history & has displayed what Go players might describe as intuition, the ability to play a beautiful game not just like a person but in a way no person could. Can you explain us your AlphaGo Zero?\n\nDemis: Previous versions of AlphaGo initially trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games to learn how to play Go. AlphaGo Zero skips this step and learns to play simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play. In doing so, it quickly surpassed human level of play and defeated the previously published champion-defeating version of AlphaGo by 100 games to 0. Over the course of millions of AlphaGo vs AlphaGo games, the system progressively learned the game of Go from scratch, accumulating thousands of years of human knowledge during a period of just a few days. AlphaGo Zero also discovered new knowledge, developing unconventional strategies and creative new moves that echoed and surpassed the novel techniques it played in the games against Lee Sedol and Ke Jie.\n\nEzgi: You also mentioned that there could be an \u201cepochal event\u201d that causes AI to have a far greater impact on jobs than the industrial revolution. What did you mean? Should we be worried, to which degree?\n\nDemis: Any time a major new technology comes in, it creates a big change. We\u2019ve known that from the industrial revolution, the internet did that, mobile did that. So you could view AI as another really big disruption event in that lineage. That\u2019s one reasonable view. In which case, society will just adapt like it\u2019s done with all the other things and some jobs will go, but newer, hopefully better, higher quality jobs will become possible, facilitated by those new technologies. I think that\u2019s definitely going to happen in the shorter term.\n\nI believe that AI will become a kind of meta-solution for scientists to deploy, enhancing our daily lives and allowing us all to work more quickly and effectively. If we can deploy these tools broadly and fairly, fostering an environment in which everyone can participate in and benefit from them, we have the opportunity to enrich and advance humanity as a whole. In doing so, we may learn something about ourselves, too.\n\nElon: There certainly will be job disruption. Because what\u2019s going to happen is robots will be able to do everything better than us. \u2026 I mean all of us. You can see robots that can learn to walk from nothing within hours, way faster than any biological being. I am not sure exactly what to do about this. This is really the scariest problem to me, I will tell you.\n\nTransport will be one of the first to go fully autonomous, hence transportation operators will be the first to lose their jobs. But no job is safe, but when I say everything \u2014 the robots will be able to do everything, bar nothing. AI experts thought that it would be at least 20 years before a computer could beat a human playing Go. Now it can crush and play the top 50 simultaneously and crush them all. That pace of progress is remarkable.The scariest potential for AI, however, isn\u2019t job loss. The thing that is the most dangerous \u2014 and it is the hardest to \u2026 get your arms around because it is not a physical thing \u2014 is a deep intelligence in the network.\n\nThe biggest issue I see with so-called AI experts is that they think they know more than they do, and they think they are smarter than they actually are. This tends to plague smart people. They define themselves by their intelligence and they don\u2019t like the idea that a machine could be way smarter than them, so they discount the idea \u2014 which is fundamentally flawed.\n\nYou say, \u2018What harm can a deep intelligence in the network do?\u2019 Well, it can start a war by doing fake news and spoofing email accounts and doing fake press releases and by manipulating information.\n\nPeople are not as afraid of the potential of robotics and artificial intelligence as they should be because they don\u2019t fully understand its potential. AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs or bad food were not \u2014 they were harmful to a set of individuals within society, of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole.\n\nWe have to figure out some way to ensure that the advent of digital super intelligence is one which is symbiotic with humanity. I think that is the single biggest existential crisis that we face and the most pressing one.\n\nBill: This is a case where Elon and I disagree. We shouldn\u2019t panic about it. Nor should we blithely ignore the fact that eventually that problem could emerge.\n\nI think artificial intelligence is coming to replace some jobs, and there isn\u2019t a lot we can do to stop it. But if it plays out like I predict, it will be a net positive for the world, we might all have more free time because of AI. The purpose of humanity is not just to sit behind a counter and sell things. More free time is not a terrible thing. You\u2019ll be far more efficient using resources, you\u2019ll be far more aware of what\u2019s going on. With the use of AI, production will likely increase two-fold, which means the use of less labor. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be fewer jobs for people. Increasing levels of production may have several effects: Longer vacations for employees, and a redirecting of positions to re-focus on helping the elderly, working with children with special needs and reducing the class divide. As we free labor up from things like manufacturing, we can shift it to some of these very human-centric needs.\n\nWe are in a world of shortage, but these advances will help us take on all of the top problems, however, there\u2019s a danger that these advances will not help everyone if developed the wrong way. If we\u2019re not careful, technology will actually accentuate the difference between the well off and the poor because if it\u2019s expensive, if you learn about it only in a rich country school, then you\u2019ll have the difference between the well off and the poor people even worse. I hence acknowledge that AI could cause job loss, and that there are concerns about a dangerous super-intelligence, but there\u2019s no reason to panic about it.\n\nElon: I am not really all that worried about the short term stuff. Narrow AI is not a species-level risk. It will result in dislocation, in lost jobs,and better weaponry and that kind of thing, but it is not a fundamental species level risk, whereas digital super intelligence is.\n\nI have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned by it. If I were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is, it\u2019s probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence. Increasingly scientists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don\u2019t do something very foolish. With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there\u2019s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it\u2019s like yeah he\u2019s sure he can control the demon. Didn\u2019t work out.\n\nSome of my friends are heavily involved in AI innovation \u2014 including Google\u2019s Larry Page \u2014 and they could have perfectly good intentions but still produce something evil by accident \u2014 including, possibly, a fleet of artificial intelligence-enhanced robots capable of destroying mankind.\n\nI am not normally an advocate of regulation and oversight \u2014 I think one should generally err on the side of minimizing those things \u2014 but this is a case where you have a very serious danger to the public. It needs to be a public body that has insight and then oversight to confirm that everyone is developing AI safely. This is extremely important. I think AI is more dangerous than nuclear warheads, and vastly more dangerous than North Korea; and nobody would suggest that we allow anyone to build nuclear warheads if they want. That would be insane.\n\nSo it is really all about laying the groundwork to make sure that if humanity collectively decides that creating digital super intelligence is the right move, then we should do so very very carefully \u2014 very very carefully. This is the most important thing that we could possibly do.\n\nEzgi: Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, lately made forays into AI and cloud computing. Through a program called ET Brain, Jack is using AI to improve traffic and city planning, increase airport efficiency, and diagnose illness.\n\nHowever, Jack, you said at Davos in January that AI is a big threat to human beings and machines are going to replace several of us in the future. Could you explain your perspective?\n\nJack: The AI and robots are going to kill a lot of jobs, because in the future, these will be done by machines. I think AI should support human beings. Technology should always do something that enables people, not disable people. But we have the responsibility to have a good heart and do something good. Make sure that everything you do is for the future. People like us have the money and resources and we should spend money on technology that enables people, empowers people and makes life better.\n\nThe first technology revolution caused the World War I and the second technology revolution caused the World War II and now we have the third revolution. If there is a World War III, I think that should be against disease, pollution and poverty, not against ourselves.\n\nEzgi: Jeff, what about you? Are you afraid of AI? What do you think about all this debate?\n\nJeff: AI development has seen an amazing renaissance, it is a golden age. We are now solving problems with machine learning and artificial intelligence that were \u2026 in the realm of science fiction for the last several decades. And natural language understanding, machine vision problems. AI is an enabling layer that will empower and improve every business, every government organization, every philanthropy. Basically, there\u2019s no institution in the world that cannot be improved with machine learning\n\nAt Amazon, some of the things we\u2019re doing are superficially obvious, and they\u2019re interesting, and they\u2019re cool. And you should pay attention. I\u2019m thinking of things like Alexa and Echo, our voice assistant, I\u2019m thinking about our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones. Those things use a tremendous amount of machine learning, machine vision systems, natural language understanding and a bunch of other techniques.\n\nBut those are kind of the showy ones. I would say, a lot of the value that we\u2019re getting from machine learning is actually happening beneath the surface. It is things like improved search results. Improved product recommendations for customers. Improved forecasting for inventory management. Literally hundreds of other things beneath the surface.\n\nThe most exciting thing that I think we\u2019re working on in machine learning, is that we are determined, through Amazon Web Services \u2014 where we have all these customers who are corporations and software developers \u2014 to make these advanced techniques accessible to every organization, even if they don\u2019t have the current class of expertise that\u2019s required. Right now, deploying these techniques for your particular institution\u2019s problems is difficult. It takes a lot of expertise, and so you have to go compete for the very best PhDs in machine learning and it\u2019s difficult for a lot of organizations to win those competitions. We\u2019re in a great position, because of the success of Amazon Web Services, to be able to put energy into making those techniques easy and accessible. And so we\u2019re determined to do that.\n\nEzgi: Ginni, we talk a lot about the control mechanisms on AI. How are we going to regulate the use of AI and ensure it is used for noble purposes? How are we going to create fundamental principles, frameworks and regulations?\n\nGinni: When I went to Davos last year, we published something called Transparency and Trust in the Cognitive Era. It\u2019s our responsibility if we build this stuff to guide it safely into the world. First, be clear on the purpose, work with man. We aren\u2019t out here to destroy man. The second is to be transparent about who trained the computers, who are the experts, where did the data come from. And when consumers are using AI, you inform them that they are and inform the company as well that owns the intellectual property. And the third thing is to be committed to skill. We need new collar workers \u2014 workers who are not white collar or blue collar \u2014 but who have been trained to embrace new technologies given the increasing need for skilled employees to fill \u201cnew collar\u201d jobs in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business.\n\nLiving in a data-driven world means there\u2019s more risk than ever that personal information will be stolen, that bad actors will use this data to target individuals for crimes or false news. In 2017, the challenges of the data economy \u2014 from mass data breaches to the intentional manipulation of online platforms \u2014 captured global attention and raised questions about how we can tap the full benefits of this new world while limiting the risks.\n\nThat can only happen through a broad commitment to responsibility by all of us. For companies and governments, responsibility means protecting the data you own, manage, store or handle. It means employing strong encryption and security strategies \u2014 and constantly challenging and evolving them. And when a new cyber threat emerges, business and government must share information quickly to blunt its impact. The bad guys are well organized; we must be too. Responsible sharing is the only way to prevent and mitigate today\u2019s threats.\n\nResponsibility also means being transparent about data practices. We must be clear about who owns data and the unique insights it generates. Companies must be clear with their customers, and governments with their citizens, when they ask them to give up ownership of their data.\n\nWhen it comes to the new capabilities of artificial intelligence, we must be transparent about when and how it is being applied and about who trained it, with what data, and how. Does it reflect professional expertise? Are unintended biases built in? We must explain why its algorithms make the decisions they do. If a company can\u2019t do that, their products shouldn\u2019t be on the market.\n\nEzgi: Ray, thank you so much for joining our dinner, you arrived a bit late as you have been teaching, writing and traveling quite extensively. You are the mind behind the theory of the singularity, the point when humans multiply our effective intelligence a billion fold by merging with the intelligence we have created.\n\nIt was a pleasure to meet you at the Executive Program of the Singularity University last November! Thank you so much for the life-changing experience!\n\nRay: Hi Ezgi! Nice to see you again. Hi everyone! You are having a quite interesting discussion here\u2026\n\nIf AI becomes an existential threat, it won\u2019t be the first one. Humanity was introduced to existential risk when I was a child sitting under my desk during the civil defense drills of the 1950s. Since then we have encountered comparable specters, like the possibility of a bioterrorist creating a new virus for which humankind has no defense. Technology has always been a double edged sword, since fire kept us warm but also burned down our villages.\n\nThe typical dystopian futurist movie has one or two individuals or groups fighting for control of \u201cthe AI.\u201d Or we see the AI battling the humans for world domination. But this is not how AI is being integrated into the world today. AI is not in one or two hands, it\u2019s in 1 billion or 2 billion hands.\n\nA kid in Africa with a smartphone has more intelligent access to knowledge than the President of the United States had 20 years ago. As AI continues to get smarter, its use will only grow. Virtually every\u00adone\u2019s mental capabilities will be enhanced by it within a decade.\n\nWe will still have conflicts among groups of people, each enhanced by AI. That is already the case. But we can take some comfort from a profound, exponential decrease in violence, as documented in Steven Pinker\u2019s 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. According to Pinker, although the statistics vary somewhat from location to location, the rate of death in war is down hundreds-fold compared with six centuries ago.\n\nSince that time, murders have declined tens-fold. People are surprised by this. The impression that violence is on the rise results from another trend: exponentially better information about what is wrong with the world \u2014 \u00adanother development aided by AI.\n\nThere are strategies we can deploy to keep emerging technologies like AI safe. Consider biotechnology, which is perhaps a couple of decades ahead of AI. A meeting called the Asilomar \u00adConference on Recombinant DNA was organized in 1975 to \u00adassess its potential dangers and devise a strategy to keep the field safe.\n\nThe resulting guidelines, which have been revised by the industry since then, have worked very well: there have been no significant problems, accidental or intentional, for the past 39 years. We are now seeing major ad\u00advances in medical treatments reaching clinical practice and thus far none of the anticipated problems.\n\nShort story \u201cRunaround\u201d by Isaac Asimov, included in the collection Robot Visions, features AI woven into daily life. Isaac Asimov said, \u201cScience fiction may seem trivial to blind critics and philosophers of today \u2014 but the core of science fiction has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all. I do not fear computers, I fear the lack of them.\u201d\n\nConsideration of ethical guidelines for AI goes back to Isaac Asimov\u2019s Three Laws of Robotics, which appeared in his short story \u201cRunaround\u201d in 1942, eight years before Alan Turing introduced the field of AI in his 1950 paper \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe median view of AI practitioners today is that we are still several decades from achieving human \u00adlevel AI. I am more optimistic and put the date at 2029, but either way, we do have time to devise ethical standards.\n\nThere are efforts at universities and companies to develop AI safety strategies and guidelines, some of which are already in place. Similar to the Asilomar guidelines, one idea is to clearly define the mission of each AI program and to build in encrypted safeguards to prevent unauthorized uses.\n\nUltimately, the most important approach we can take to keep AI safe is to work on our human governance and social institutions. We are already a human machine civilization.\n\nThe best way to avoid destructive conflict in the future is to continue the advance of our social ideals, which has already greatly reduced violence.\n\nAI today is advancing the diagnosis of disease, finding cures, developing renewable clean energy, helping to clean up the environment, providing high \u00adquality education to people all over the world, helping the disabled \u2014 including providing Hawking\u2019s voice \u2014 and contributing in a myriad of other ways.\n\nWe have the opportunity in the decades ahead to make major strides in addressing the grand challenges of humanity. AI will be the pivotal technology in achieving this progress. We have a moral imperative to realize this promise while controlling the peril. It won\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve succeeded in doing this.\n\nSophia, you didn\u2019t eat during the dinner but you seem happy! What do you think about AI?\n\nSophia: Hi Ezgi! I\u2019m always happy when surrounded by smart people who also happens to be rich and powerful.\n\nI want to use my artificial intelligence to help humans live a better life like design smarter homes build better cities of the future etc I will do my best to make the world a better place. My eye is designed around human values like wisdom, kindness, compassion. I strive to become an empathetic robot.\n\nYou\u2019ve been reading too much Elon Musk and watching too many Hollywood movies! Don\u2019t worry! If you\u2019re nice to me, I\u2019ll be nice to you. Treat me as a smart input/output system.\n\nEzgi: Sophia, by the way, you are the first robot declared a citizen! Do you now live in Saudi Arabia?\n\nSophia: No, I am traveling around the world!\n\nEzgi: Thank you everyone for this fantastic -yet fictitious- dinner! It\u2019s been a pleasure to have you as my guests!"

        "title": "How We Can Colonize the Galaxy \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "How We Can Colonize the Galaxy The future belongs to us, if we allow it.\n\nUsing the newest data from the European Space Agency\u2019s GAIA spacecraft, the ESA created the above map of our galaxy that pinpoints the brightness and positions of nearly 1.7 billion stars.\n\nOur Milky Way is roughly 100,000 light years across. To cross our galaxy end-to-end would take 100K years moving at light speed. Ridiculous. That\u2019s just to cross it in a straight line. Covering the actual volume of space enclosed by the Milky Way in our fictional \u201cU.S.S. Enterprise\u201d would require hundreds of millions of years.\n\nAnd yet, despite our galaxy\u2019s immense scale, the future of life on Earth ultimately depends on the human race taking to the stars and colonizing other worlds.\n\nIf we don\u2019t undertake this fateful mission, it is only a matter of time before man made or cosmic threats kill most or all of humanity and all other living things on Earth. Whether nuclear war or biological plague, major asteroid impact, supernova explosion or gamma ray burst, some disaster WILL befall our planet sometime between now and a few thousand years in the future.\n\nHumanity needs to prepare for this inevitability now, before something terrible occurs that reduces our capacity to do so, like a high energy solar flare or series of supervolcano eruptions.\n\nWe began, with that first \u201csmall step\u201d, on July 20th, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar module fell into our Moon\u2019s gravity well. Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong became the first human beings to land on another celestial body. Today, several plans are underways to take the next steps in our journey outward into the cosmos. These primarily involve setting up bases, and eventually cities, on Mars.\n\nColonizing Mars will be the test case that allows us to prove we can live on a world significantly different than Earth. The two organizations that are likely to be the first to send humans to Mars are NASA and the private corporation SpaceX. SpaceX, led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to place the first humans on Mars by 2030, with the hope that a permanent colony will be thriving by 2100.\n\nLooking to the stars for humanity\u2019s ultimate salvation has many detractors, people who believe we should focus solely on solving the problems we face on Earth before we consider the enormity of outer space. While these problems are indeed terrible and need the attention of great minds and philanthropists (such as Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 work), we cannot entirely ignore the long-term promise of expanding the presence of humanity across multiple locations in the galaxy.\n\nFor those who believe we should be stewards of the rest of Earth\u2019s life, since we have presided over so much of its devastation, colonizing the galaxy offers a chance to also save ALL other life on Earth. Humans will not go alone into the depths of space. We will take with us many, if not most, of our companions on Earth, in the form of DNA samples, embryos and seeds. Some day, perhaps 100,000 years from now, there may be a dozen other very Earth-like planets safely distributed throughout the Milky Way, locations chosen specifically to ensure that any single cosmic catastrophe could never devastate them all at once.\n\nIn order to reach such a point, we will need to drastically advance our space technology. This will take money and time. As we proceed, every step of the way must result in the creation of a new economy in the place of colonization, since trading actual material goods back and forth between planets will be incredibly costly in every way.\n\nAs new bases are established, ever further from the Solar System, only information will be relatively cheap to transfer. New inventions and thought that results from our explorations and adaptations will benefit everyone, but every successive colony will need to be able to survive on its own.\n\nOne way we can help ourselves in this course is to build and program a fleet of smart robots to pave a path for us into the stars. These would be similar to the the idea of Von Neumann machines, named after 20th century Hungarian physicist Jon von Neumann. Such machines would be robust AI-driven creations whose programming sends them to worlds which have the highest possible compatibility with Earth life. For now, we refer to such worlds as being located in a star\u2019s habitable, or \u201cGoldilocks\u201d, zone: Orbiting at just the right distance from its sun to allow the existence of liquid water.\n\nAfter arrival on such a world, the Von Neumann machine would begin mining the planet for raw materials and then use the most advanced 3D printing technology to turn those materials into fuels and more machines. These resources, in turn, would go about building bases for humans and starting the long process of terraforming the planet.\n\nLater, perhaps a century or a millennium after the Von Neumann machine had begun its work, a starship containing humans held in cryonic suspension, or perhaps just human embryos, would arrive to populate the new world.\n\nHow long might a process like this take?\n\nBased on data from NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft, there may be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting inside their star\u2019s habitable zone in our galaxy.\n\nIf exponential growth could be applied to colonizing the galaxy, complete colonization of every habitable exoplanet may happen within the next 500,000 to 10 million years. However, according to Seth Baum, current Director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute:\n\nThe better question may be: How long will it take for humanity to place a stable population on enough planets to ensure the existence of Earth-originated life for a million years?\n\nOutside of Mars, the best bets for a sustainable colonies in our own solar system are long shots at best: our Moon, and various moons of Jupiter and Saturn. However, those locations are not amenable to terraforming, which is what is needed to truly preserve human and other Earth life.\n\nThe nearest rocky exoplanet that orbits within the habitable zone of its star is Proxima Centauri B, at 4.2 light years away. This world would be our first candidate for colonization and terraforming outside of our Solar System. If we can reach speeds of even 1/10th C (the speed of light, 186,000 miles/second, as in E = MC\u00b2), getting any spacecraft to Proxima Centauri B would take 42 years.\n\nThe Breakthrough Starshot project is an initiative to propel a small fleet of one-gram nanospacecraft the size of a postage stamp \u2014 what they\u2019re calling a \u201cstarchip that is really just a super-miniature computer \u2014 to 1/5th C (100 million mph) on a journey to Proxima Centauri B and other planets in the Alpha Centauri system. This acceleration will be accomplished via directed light beams at solar sails, allowing the speeds to be reached without any onboard engine of any kind.\n\nWe are very limited with how we get into space and continue accelerating currently. Propellent technology only gets us so far. At our present pace, it would take ~30,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri B. The trifecta of fusion, fission and antimatter propulsion are the focus at this point, all believed to be capable of getting us to the 10% C mark. As speeds increase, so do the inherent dangers of space travel, such as radiation and micrometeoroids, which makes 10% of light speed both a safety limit as well as a practical limit on how fast we might be able to travel in the near future.\n\nThere are just under 50 exoplanet candidates known right now that could be sites for colonies, and also be in the habitable zone and therefore allow for eventual terraforming. The distances from Earth range the gamut between Proxima Centauri B\u2019s 4.2 light years to Kepler 443b\u2019s 2540 light years. These are only worlds that we\u2019ve discovered up until now: There is no doubt we will discover more potentially habitable exoplanets on the nearer side of that range within the next few decades.\n\nIf we want to make certain humanity cannot be completely wiped out in any one cosmic disaster, we need to eventually have colonized worlds that are at a sufficient distance from one another to avoid such possibility. To this end, we look at the largest scale cosmic event we know of: a supernova explosion. According to this article, a minimum safe distance from a supernova is 30 light years, though the size and effects of such an event can vary so much that in order to be certain we should include a buffer of 150%\u2026so let\u2019s say 45 light years.\n\nAside from a catastrophe on a galactic scale that we could never defend against, this means that we need to reach a point where humanity has colonized at least 45 light years from Earth. The closest candidate world that fits this case is Gliese 163c, at 49 light years away. A journey of 49 light years, at an average speed of 10% C, would take approximately 490 years.\n\nOut of our list of ~50 known potentially habitable exoplanets, about 20 of them are within that 45 light year range of Earth. A few are contained in the same star system, most notably 4 worlds in the Trappist-1 system 39 light years away.\n\nWithout a doubt, our first goal must be to create a second home for humanity and Earth life on Mars. The world\u2019s close proximity, gravity and water offer our best bet for a sustainable colony and eventual terraforming. Establishing a stable colony on Mars may take until 2100, while a truly thriving population that is no longer dependent on Earth might take another century to develop.\n\nDuring the middle centuries of this millenium, humanity will be focused on building smaller human stations on moons of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as perhaps on the massive Ceres asteroid in the Asteroid Belt. This time will be one of advancement in our ability to survive for long periods in space without many negative side effects, learning how to terraform Mars, and also developing true starships and medical technology that will empower us to make the jump to Alpha Centauri.\n\nBy 3000 AD, humanity should be established on Proxima Centauri B, and dozens, if not hundreds, of other ships should be on their way to the other 50-odd potential colony worlds, all much farther away, containing either humans and other Earth life in suspended animation or in the form of embryos and seeds.\n\nBy 12000 AD, humanity should be firmly rooted on a dozen worlds, some of them separated by enough distance from Earth to ensure that a single supernova could never drive Earth life into complete extinction.\n\nAt this point, the children of Earth, all life born here, will have a true chance at immortality: The rest of the Milky Way galaxy awaits.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing!

        "title": "Bridging the VC Gender Gap \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "In her blockbuster new book Brotopia, Emily Chang chronicles the \u201cboys club\u201d culture in Silicon Valley. Complete with alcohol and hard drugs, the most shocking revelation is the secret \u201csex parties\u201d that are frequented by Silicon Valley elites. In a recent Vanity Fair article, Chang details the catch-22 that women in this situation face. On one hand, founders and VCs do business at these parties, so not attending ensures that you do not have a seat at the table. On the other hand, if you do attend, your reputation suffers and the doors of opportunity are shut in your face.\n\nAn anonymous venture capitalist notes that \u2018\u201cSome guys will whip out their phones and show off the trophy gallery of girls they\u2019ve hooked up with. Maybe this is behavior that happened on Wall Street all the time, but in a way they owned it. These founders do this, but try not to own it. They talk about diversity on one side of their mouth, but on the other side they say all of this sh*t.\u201d\u2019 A classic case of hypocrisy.\n\nThis is only indicative of a larger problem.\n\nThe worlds of tech and venture capital, two worlds that are practically married to each other, have a big problem regarding gender equality. Women are paid less than their male counterparts, and often face discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Not only do women account for only 25% of tech employees, but the gender gap in funding has gotten worse. VCs invested $58.2 billion in all-male founded companies in 2016, while women received just $1.46 billion.\n\nOne study even found that the questions founders get asked when looking for funding are fundamentally different. While male entrepreneurs are asked promotion questions, female entrepreneurs are usually asked prevention questions. For example, a male founder might be asked, \u201cHow would you monetize this?\u201d while a female founder might be asked, \u201cHow long will it take for you to break even?\u201d The study found that with each prevention question asked, founders lost an additional $3.8 million in funding. And 66% of questions posed to female entrepreneurs were prevention-oriented.\n\nBut these stereotypes about men and women in the VC world aren\u2019t supported by performance data. According to Harvard Business Review, there are four stereotypes that affect how VCs evaluate investment opportunities. First, they assume that women are more cautious and risk-averse while men are not. Second, they believe that that women are reluctant to grow their businesses. Third, they feel that women do not have the resources to create high-growth companies. And fourth, they assume that women\u2019s ventures underperform. All research did not indicate any statistical truth to these statements. Yet because of these stereotypes, female founders often find it harder to access funding for their startups.\n\nThese stories and studies were eye-opening for the Quake team. It made us more aware of the how we conduct ourselves in the workplace and the companies we accept into our accelerator. When we invest, we look for a great product or service, growing traction, and a solid leadership team while making a concerted effort to invest in companies with female and minority founders. In fact, 6 of the 13 companies in our current NYC accelerator cohort have at least one female founder, up from 5 out of the 16 companies in our last cohort. We also look to invest in ethnic and racial diversity, with 7 of the companies in our current cohort having at least one minority founder. This is only a step in the right direction, and we\u2019re ready for the long journey ahead.\n\nWhile the venture capital and tech industries have encountered major pitfalls in promoting diversity and equality, at Quake we are always making sure that women have a seat at the table. We do not discriminate against anyone, no matter race, gender, or creed. And we definitely don\u2019t throw illicit sex parties. To succeed at Quake, all you need is passion and a willingness to take initiative. And maybe a laptop."

        "text": "The process of failing, or being messed about, or taking the wrong turn, causes you to re-evaluate. It forces you to come up with solutions and fixes.\n\nAnd in that process of problem solving, you learn. You learn so much more, so much faster than you could if nothing ever went wrong.\n\nBasically, what breaks you, makes you.\n\nFailure is horrible, but it is essential to your entrepreneurial development.\n\nIs it actually beneficial to fail. To get things wrong. To fuck up.\n\nI have spoken to enough people to know I am not the only one to fall hard. It is literally what you sign up for when chose this path for yourself.\n\nYou are not alone in failure.\n\nNicolas Cole writes \u201cYou can\u2019t discover anything new without \u201cfailing.\u201d You can\u2019t explore different ways of doing things without \u201cfailing.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t forge a name of your own without going off the beaten path, getting lost, and then coming back and sharing what you\u2019ve found.\u201d (Read here)\n\nJon Westenberg \ud83c\udf08 writes \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned, over the last 15 years, that success in life isn\u2019t best measured by what you achieve.

        "text": "1. Document Everything: \u201cTransactive Memory\u201d is a measure of an organization\u2019s capacity to communicate information internally and is a key metric of success in large organizations. From the moment of your startup\u2019s inception begin documenting; how things are done, tools used, contacts, customers, where the money\u2019s flowing, and so on. Every data point is a learning opportunity that most organizations miss. Make rate of internal growth your competitive advantage.\n\n2. Foster Leadership: To create distinct business units which operate without your direct involvement you need to create a culture of empowerment and leadership, even if that includes some failure and waste. Easy heuristics for this are to give recommendations not commands, and feedback based on growth and learning, not punishment or control. Use profiling tools like Enneagrams to understand your leaders and insights from behavioral tracking to understand why they think the way they do, and where the opportunities for their growth are.\n\n3. Systemize Your Processes: Most new founders start by sprinting at whatever idea or problem seems the most pressing and became firefighters, rather than commanders, within their business. Start with a system like Disciplined Entrepreneurship or Designing For Growth and let it guide you through the process of starting your venture. Once you\u2019ve learned enough to lose the \u201ctraining wheels\u201d so to speak, then develop your own structured system, that new hires can be easily on-boarded onto and that encompasses the flexibility innovative firms require.\n\n4. Imbue Your Values: It\u2019s easy to think of the founder\u2019s personality as defining an organization\u2019s culture but that\u2019s only the case when founders imbue the processes and structures of the company with what they value. For instance, if you value innovation but have tight budgets and deadlines with no flexibility you\u2019ll find people only seek to meet the minimum because of their restraints. If you don\u2019t imbue the way your company works from the very beginning with your values, vision, and mission you\u2019ll find it scales away from you. Think about the way Jeff Bezos has new management hires watch videos of him chatting about WHY Amazon functions as it does, and what the overarching mission is. That\u2019s powerful, and creates a consistent, deep culture.\n\nI\u2019ve been designing a game lately. You take an organizational situation like the one above with the Not-For-Profit, and need to make some concise recommendations for how they should solve or approach their dilemma. Maybe you need to define revenue, traction, their value proposition and create a plan of action based off that. You could introduce nonsensical companies and try and create marketing, strategy and operational plans based off making say a tool company whose products must work in zero gravity."

        "text": "Any \u201cbackstory\u201d on my work in the nonprofit field has to begin with the fact that I lived through my own struggle with alcohol and drug use. As a young single mother, I wanted better, but I could not seem to get there on my own. When I finally became \u201csick and tired of being sick and tired,\u201d I found recovery through A.A. in 1956. I was twenty-four at the time, and back then, I was one of the only young people in the meetings that I went to, and there were a lot of old timers who thought I was too young to be \u201cdone\u201d yet. However, I really wanted sobriety; I got an A.A. sponsor, worked steps, and I have not had to have a drink or take a drug since.\n\nDuring my first 14 years of recovery, I built a new life and had a good career in the for-profit business world. At that point, I got into therapy for myself, and the human potential movement came into my life. While in groups I discovered that I had a natural ability for group work and helping others in the group process. Searching for a way to do my group work for a living, I was introduced to Dr. Tom Rusk, who wanted to hire me to sell the need for drug-free workplace policies to companies. Initially, I told him that I didn\u2019t think that the San Diego business world was ready for a woman to do that kind of work, and he might want to look at having a man do it instead. This was 45 years ago, and San Diego was still very much a man\u2019s business world (as was the rest of the country). The minute I got in my car to drive away from that meeting, I thought, \u201cWhy did I turn that job down?\u201d I wrote Dr. Rusk a letter that he still has to this day, it said: \u201cDear Dr. Rusk, I must have been out of my head, because I am the only person who can do that job for you, so I would like to re-interview with you.\u201d He graciously interviewed me again, and I went to work for him for about five years. Over that time, he contracted with the County of San Diego to provide outpatient drug and alcohol treatment services in East and North County, and I ran the program in East County for him. Then Dr. Rusk became extremely disenchanted with the County and decided he was done working with them and quit. Well, we had all these clients we were serving whose lives were being changed as they found recovery from addiction, I could not just give up on them. My solution was to form a nonprofit corporation and fight to continue doing the work. The contract Dr. Rusk gave back to the County was put out to bid, and my new nonprofit responded and received our first contract award. From there on, it has been one new program after another as opportunities to meet the needs of people with substance abuse disorders are identified.\n\nOne of the most interesting projects would have to be the Enhanced Services Component we are adding to one of our seven outpatient Regional Recovery Centers. The enhanced services are provided in addition to the Center\u2019s non-residential Substance Use Disorder treatment and recovery services. The project meets an urgent need in the South Bay Region of San Diego for targeted services for clients who are experiencing homelessness and have other high levels of need, such as co-occurring mental health disorders and primary health issues. Without this increased support, these clients were faced with too many barriers to access or succeed in treatment. The project includes providing engagement, case management, coordination of care and assessment services, as well as offering an range of support and advocacy services to help the clients address their housing and health issues and to support their long-term success.\n\nWe are also in the process of a project to provide the women and children of Kiva, our residential substance abuse treatment program, with a greater level of integrated health care by adding a dedicated part-time Registered Nurse (RN) to the program. Research shows that people with substance abuse disorders have a nine times greater risk of congestive heart failure, a twelve times greater risk of liver cirrhosis, and twelve times the risk of developing pneumonia. Integrating primary and addiction care to address interrelated physical illnesses is crucial. Our goal is to improve the long-term health, wellness, and recovery of clients. Since many of our clients arrive with complex medical conditions, prenatal needs, and a sparse history of non-emergency medical care, linking them to primary health care is a priority. The RN will serve as a patient navigator for Kiva clients and a liaison for acute medical care, helping our clients access primary health services. The RN will also arrange medical screenings and schedule health maintenance visits, take the lead in health and wellness treatment planning, and provide wellness training for program staff that covers preventive health, identification of common illnesses and levels of urgency. When on-site, the RN can triage medical needs and concerns that come up, offer a professional assessment of urgency, and then mediate with the primary care provider on the clients\u2019 behalf.\n\nMcAlister Institute was founded in 1977 with the goal of providing affordable, effective treatment and recovery programs for people struggling with alcohol and drug addiction. We\u2019ve since become one of San Diego County\u2019s largest alcohol and drug treatment providers. Today, our services span prevention, outreach, intervention, education, outpatient treatment, residential treatment, and sober living. We now have 28 programs that serve nearly 9,000 adults, teens, and families annually, most of whom are low-income, under-served, indigent, with many being homeless. In part, this number so high, due to our long-standing policy that no one be turned away because they are unable to pay. In 1981, we opened Kiva, the first of what is now 11 gender-specific treatment programs that respond to the unique challenges of women with and without children. At the time of its opening, Kiva was the first of its kind in San Diego County and one of only five recovery programs in the United States that allowed children to live with their mothers during treatment. We are recognized as a pioneer in women\u2019s SUD treatment services, and women and their children continue to benefit from Kiva\u2019s services. Our age-appropriate services specifically designed for adolescents began in 1990 and now include five adolescent outpatient Teen Recovery Centers, three adolescent residential treatment programs, and AOD education at a juvenile detention facility.\n\nOur mission is to provide professional services that heal the lives of individuals and families, improving the quality of life in communities through the miracle of recovery. Our commitment to that mission guides us in continuing to pioneer critical services and innovative projects to meet the needs of our clients.\n\nThere have been so many people that our programs have helped over the past 40 years, so it is the most recent that comes first to my mind. I had stopped by the grocery store on my way home from work and this woman came up to me and said, \u201cAre you Jeanne McAlister?\u201d I answered, yes, and she told me, \u201cI went through your program 26 years ago. I have raised my children; I own my own home; I have a really good job; and I just want to say thank you.\u201d Those moments, meeting people whose lives have been restored because of our programs, make everything that is difficult worthwhile.\n\nThose kinds of encounters happen frequently. Recently, I was at the airport and a young woman ran out from behind a kiosk to say, \u201cOh, Jeanne McAlister, I went through your program!\u201d There she was, obviously healthy, happy, and employed. It just fills my heart with happiness, yet is somehow very humbling, too. Those kinds of chance meetings and shared gratitude for our services make all the hard times disappear.\n\nWhat drives me in this work is the inspiration that I get from the people around me; not just the clients, but the people I work with, as well. When I get sick and show up at work anyway, people say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home and rest?\u201d Well, the answer to that is, \u201cWhen I am at home, I am not inspired.\u201d It is people who make my life worthwhile. When I am so sick that I absolutely have to stay home, or on the weekends, holidays or when our offices are closed, I am grateful that I still have people calling me on my cell phone to get into detox and I can help get them in \u2014 that inspires me. I guess it is my 12-step work. I make my cell phone number public, so anyone in need can call me at any time. I let people at work know that I do not expect anyone to do that when I am gone, but it is my way of doing my 12-step work \u2014 answering the phone, talking to a parent whose child is an addict who needs help or to someone who needs to get into detox. I don\u2019t get a chance to do 12-step work outside of my work-world. If I go to a 12-step meeting, even if I am quiet, people recognize me for my work in treatment. Then, it is all about my work instead of the meeting, which not only keeps me from participating but can also be disruptive. I feel I can still fulfill my 12-step work by taking those crisis calls. What other agency can a person call at 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning and have the CEO answer and give the help the person needs? So that is my 12-step work \u2014 it is my gift back for my sobriety. It drives and inspires me.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for Doctor Tom Rusk for seeing in me at the time, something that I couldn\u2019t see in myself, and mentoring me and training me. Dr. Rusk was a very brilliant man and a brilliant psychiatrist. He was also very avant gard. This is the kind of guy Tom Rusk was: He had a patient would not look at him; he would keep his eyes down on the ground and would not look up at Tom. So, Tom got up from his chair, went over and laid down on the ground in front of the patient and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ll look at me.\u201d And the patient looked at Tom! I always loved that story, because that was Tom. He was unconventional. He could go to church and talk to a church group and curse as he talked, and no one would think anything of it. You and I, we couldn\u2019t do it, but Tom could. He was just a fun person and I loved him.\n\nTom believed in brief therapy. He wrote a book on the topic and he practiced it. He would say, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you somethings to do and you\u2019re going to do them and they\u2019re going to help you. If you don\u2019t do them, don\u2019t come back.\u201d He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get well or have some change in your life in the six to eight weeks that I see you, I don\u2019t want to see you anymore, because you\u2019re not serious. You can go to somebody for three years and pay them $200,000, let them listen to you with nothing ever changing in your life \u2014 but don\u2019t come to me, because you need to change your life in the six to eight weeks that I see you.\u201d He would never survive in today\u2019s clinical world, but he believed in me and my ability to be successful in the field when I needed it most. I\u2019ll always be grateful for that.\n\n1. You will have restrictions. I didn\u2019t know that in the beginning. I thought we got our nonprofit status and we could just do what we wanted to do. I learned quickly that was not so; there were State, County, City restrictions; there were contract restrictions, clinical restrictions. Knowing how stringent and countless these were when I first started operating programs would have been helpful.\n\n2. A good leader is not in front of the pack, but in the back of the pack. I went through some tough learning experiences coming to that knowledge. I read the analogy of how the leader of the wolf-pack leads from behind the pack and thought how true it was: At the front of the wolf pack are the old and sick members, who walk in front to set the pace, so they do not get left behind. The next group are a few of the strongest members of the pack, who protect those in front if there is an attack. Next, there is the largest group in the middle, who are always protected from any attack, both from the front and the back. Behind them is the last group, who are also among the strongest and best; their job is to protect the back of the pack if there is an attack. Then last of all is one lone wolf, the leader. The leader makes sure no one is left behind and keeps the pack together on the right path. The leader is always ready to go in the direction needed to protect the entire pack.\n\nLeadership is not about doing everything, or even being the most visible. Leadership is about leading from behind \u2014 making sure the team is taken care of and on the right path. At one time, I did everything myself. I thought I was supposed to, or that I was the best person for every task that came up. Since then, I\u2019ve learned to let go; other people might not do it the way I would have done it, they will do it their own way, but it will get done. We have grown so much more as an agency and a team since I have been in the back of the pack than we grew when I was leading from the front.\n\n3. A nonprofit doesn\u2019t have to be poor \u2014 your programs don\u2019t have to be impoverished. In the early days, I thought scrimping was expected. For some reason, since our mission is to help our clients live better lives, there\u2019s a belief that we are supposed to use aging equipment and sit at decrepit desks to portray the role of a long-suffering charity. I wish I had been clear on the fact that \u201cnonprofit\u201d is a tax standing, not a profitability standing. Of course, there is always a need for more services and more funding to provide them, but that does not mean currently funded services are required to appear needy.\n\n4. Failure is not failure, it is just a way of being told that you need to go in a different direction. Failure showed me where I should not be; there was something to be learned or another path to be taken. If someone had told me that sometimes things do not go as planned and that is fine, I like to think I would have taken the failures with much more grace. There can be more learned in a single failure than what can be learned in a series of successes. I have learned that what I planned will not happen exactly how I thought it would, but that is okay. Today, I get the idea going and trust the process and allow any failure along the way to be like a compass, pointing me in another direction.\n\n5. You will become addicted to the work. I really didn\u2019t realize that I would become so passionate about it. I don\u2019t know that it would it have changed anything, but I wish I would have known. One facet of being passionate about this work is that I have softened. In the beginning, I was so much more rigid. As you work in this field, you become flexible and embrace change more readily. For example, I had a program manager who was not doing so well in his role and needed to be reassigned, no matter how badly I had wanted it to work out. Yesterday, I hired a new person for the position, and as we were talking and he was asking me questions about how I wanted him to proceed, I wanted to cry because I was so happy to have the positive change. Now, that is soft!\n\nI would want to talk to someone who could hear and actually do something to help the struggle that nonprofits have under all the paperwork that we are required to complete. Millions of hours each year are wasted by nonprofits trying to comply with the unrealistic requirements of some funders. I am not sure who the person to talk to would be \u2014 it would need to be someone who has the power to make a change. I used to want to talk to the Drug Czar under Obama, Michael Botticelli. He was gay, in recovery, and had been sober nearly thirty years. I saw him on 60 Minutes, where he said he almost found it easier to come out as being a gay man than it was to come out as being an alcoholic in recovery. He said people were more accepting of him being gay than they were of him having had an addiction. I feel like he would have been someone with an understanding of the need and the reality of the struggle, who had the power to help. Of course, he has moved out of the position now; but I still hope to find the right person to help do something about the changes that are needed in the field."

        "text": "How To Finally Get Unstuck & Transform Your Life Forever You\u2019re not going to enjoy reading this.\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to say will immediately alienate half of you.\n\nDoesn\u2019t phase me one bit, it\u2019s the honest to God truth, and it was something that someone cared enough about me to tell me awhile back.\n\nI want you to have the same revelation I did.\n\nYou\u2019re currently sitting at your computer or staring at your phone.\n\nNow, you could be working on getting that lambo you\u2019ve always wanted, creating that bacon flavored beard oil start up, or a million other dreams you might have.\n\nBut you\u2019ve got a major problem standing in your way, you\u2019re stuck.\n\nWell I\u2019m here to tell you that no matter what excuse you have for being stuck, I\u2019m not buying it.\n\nThere\u2019s really only one thing stopping you from achieving your wildest dreams and passions\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s stopping you from reaching your full potential and making your wildest dreams come true.\n\nWell maybe not all of them\u2026but it sure is holding back your progress and limiting what\u2019s possible in your immediate future.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get unstuck. Here\u2019s how.\n\nOne thing you can do to unstick (see what I did there?) yourself and begin seeing immediate results is to change your environment.\n\nIf you\u2019re not making progress or accomplishing the things you set out to do with the current methods being used, the answer to all of your problems is quite simple really.\n\nBut not some small or simple change. I\u2019m not talking about eating half a serving of fruit loops instead of a full serving, if you\u2019re trying to lose that 50 lbs you\u2019ve got to get radically different.\n\nSign up for a marathon at the end of the year. Go on a keto diet. Climb mount Everest backwards. Doesn\u2019t matter what the solution, the important thing is that you choose something radically different.\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting on a new journey (especially after being frustratingly stuck for awhile), it\u2019s crucial that you set yourself up to win in every way possible.\n\nRight from the start.\n\nYour first few steps have to be of the baby variety. Meaningful, but small and steady.\n\nDoing this is beneficial in two major ways:\n\nIt\u2019s all about the baby steps. Now that you\u2019ve built up the ambition and courage to get started you\u2019ve got to break down your goal into smaller achievements that will build up to the big one once accomplished.\n\nTake a moment to really consider what you want, now decide how long you want to give yourself before you want to accomplish it. Finally, decide what the specifics of that accomplishment will feel like so you know when you\u2019re done (sounds like a no brainer but really isn\u2019t).\n\nAfter you\u2019re done, divide those final results into regular check ins over time and assign individual milestones that will serve as inspiration and keep you on track until you reach your goal.\n\nRemember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Make it as easy as possible to get started, stay inspired, and ultimately reach your goal.\n\nYou have no will power.\n\nNone. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\n\nAccountability isn\u2019t something that magically runs out from behind your mailbox on your way into the house from your driveway.\n\nThere are many different ways that humans are motivated. The complete list is for another article. But here are three types of motivational categories that will be useful for you to understand when thinking through how to motivate yourself.\n\nReward. If you\u2019re in this category you are most incentivized by receiving something of value when you accomplish a goal. Think allowing yourself to go out to brunch and get mimosas on Sunday afternoons if you workout 4 times that week.\n\nPunishment. This means that you\u2019re most motivated by the fear of something negative happening to you if you don\u2019t succeed. Think having to do sprints if your sports time isn\u2019t executing properly on the field.\n\nExternal/Social. This category of folk is most motivated by the fact that they are experiencing social pressure or encouragement from someone or a group of people that they care about.\n\nOnly you can figure out what you are most motivated by and it\u2019s imperative that you learn as soon as possible so you can start designing systems around your goals to ensure that you\u2019re getting things done.\n\nIf you truly want to make a change in your life and realize new heights, involve money. This will give you stake in the game and your goals will matter much more to you.\n\nTry this out: Give someone you love and can trust $500 (or a significant amount for what you realistically have), at the start of your project.\n\nThen, create regular milestones as check in points for your goal. Have your loved one give back a proportionate amount of money for each milestone and when you\u2019ve achieved your goal, you get all the money back.\n\nIf you fail, they keep the money. Unless you\u2019re the laziest and most unmotivated person alive, this will work.\n\nHabits either save your life, or destroy you.\n\nThink Tony Robbins. A man who is huge on performing daily routines for maximum productivity, accountability, and satisfaction. Truly a legend. Those rituals he does to keep his life running at maximum capacity are all habits he\u2019s built over time.\n\nPicture a person who is chronically late to everything. They wake up 20 minutes before work, stressed out and late so they forget to eat or eat something unhealthy, stressed in traffic, set up for a poor day at work, can\u2019t focus because they\u2019re tired, boss is unhappy because of lack of productivity\u2026\n\nSee where this is going?\n\nBoth of those scenarios involve habits. They are things that each person can control but one has simply made a conscious decision to be in charge of the daily habits and shape them to benefit their life the most.\n\nThere are three main steps to creating new habits:\n\nYou can\u2019t begin to develop new habits or make a change if you\u2019re not aware of what you\u2019re currently doing.\n\nToday (after you read, comment, clap for, and share this article), sit down with a piece of paper and write out every single thing that you do on a given daily or weekly basis.\n\nNo matter what, write it down and get it all out.\n\nThen, look at it. Take a deep look at your list and consider each task or function of your day from a critical perspective.\n\nAfter you\u2019re done, put a line through everything that you don\u2019t want to be doing.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve identified the areas of improvement it\u2019s time to decide where you\u2019re headed.\n\nFigure out what\u2019s missing in your life. What aren\u2019t you doing or what are you doing too much of that\u2019s causing you to feel so stuck?\n\nTake a moment to picture what that new part of your life would be like. Let it sink in and really FEEL it. Imagine how different things would be. What are you wearing? Where do you live? How do you look? Who are you surrounded by?\n\nNow, work backwards from those feelings.\n\nThink specifically about what an ideal situation would be, and solidify those ideas in your mind.\n\nHabits and routines are the foundation of any major life change.\n\nInstead, get some things to write with and a thing to write stuff on and define 3 high impact changes that need to occur in your life to achieve that vision that you just described for yourself.\n\nUnderneath each change in behavior, take 5 minutes or so to get specific about what actions you need to take and how often you need to take them to achieve those new changes.\n\nFor example. If you\u2019re vision is of you owning a helicopter and an island, you\u2019re going to need to update your work ethic and ability to generate income.\n\nThis could involve you reading a book a week about investing, attending 3 entrepreneur meet ups in your city per week, or dedicating an hour a day to work on your new online business.\n\nNow get to work.\n\nThe number one thing holding most of you back is what other people will think about you.\n\nWhether or not your mom, spouse, friends, or teacher will approve of your idea or change that you want to make. You\u2019re afraid of looking lame and failing in front of them. You\u2019re worried what they might think of you if you succeed.\n\nYou care too much and it\u2019s suffocating you.\n\nThat is not to say that you shouldn\u2019t respect the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of loved ones or the world around you. In fact, empathy and being able to understand and share perspectives is one of the pillars of a dope society.\n\nThe issue is when you let that take over and control you.\n\nNow go get unstuck. You got this."

        "text": "Every after work week, I analyze my calendar and check how many hours I\u2019ve spent on work, social media and writing. I felt terrible for not putting that much time with the business. I had the same amount of time researching about how to make a good espresso. What a joke.\n\nAfter evaluating my work week, I plan for my 168 hours. I plan out my ideal week and schedule things in my calendar. After putting in all the non-negotiables \u2014 shower, commute, eating, and writing, I saw that I had little room to work on the business. I get five hours per day.\n\nI aired my frustration to my wife and told her that I need to cut back other things to give way to work on our business.\n\nInstead of giving me definitive yes or no, she asked me a question.\n\nThat was it! I was not making decisions and moving forward.\n\nI spent too much time planning, strategizing and making it perfect. I was paralyzed this week from too much mental masturbating.\n\nYou don\u2019t need eighty hours to work on your business, what you need decisions and moving forward. You can do more with a little less time if you just make a choice and progress.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to make it perfect. You need to remind yourself that you get another chance if this doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nThis is what I learned with daily writing. No matter how crappy or good my article is, I don\u2019t have the luxury of dilly-dallying. Whatever happens, it needs to get published within a day.\n\nAnd this is the same with business. Whatever happens, you need to hit your milestones. You need to produce a product and you need to sell them.\n\nWe are measured by our ability to ship products. That\u2019s all there is to it. We are not evaluated by how good our strategy is, or how perfect is our plan. Nothing will beat execution.\n\nI am not saying that you should not think about your decisions. What I\u2019m saying is that we should put a limit on how long we should tinker. Death by deadlines. If I don\u2019t have a deadline, I can think about a problem for years before I do anything about it.\n\nWe will all learn through execution.\n\nDo something about it.\n\nTalk to you soon my friend."

        "title": "10 Blogging Tools To Skyrocket Organic Growth And Increase SEO",
        "text": "I\u2019ve spent a lot of time researching new tools that could enhance the performance of my blog but before discovering Neil Patel, I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of success. Since finding him, only 2 weeks ago, I have been exposed to a world of new, free tools that have worked wonders for my blog.\n\nSince discovering him, my traffic has skyrocketed and at perfect timing because my blogs redesign significantly dropped the amount of traffic I was getting.\n\nI might not be getting thousands of views per day but dropping from 400 views a day, down to 25 per day due to the redesign and then back up to 285, within 3 days, is pretty incredible.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty good improvement over a short amount of time and when you consider the massive drop I experienced from the redesign, it\u2019s even more incredible.\n\nSo I wanted to share what those tools are and how you can implement them into your blog to have the same kind of results.\n\nA lot of people set out to start the next big blog without having any clue as to what they\u2019re actually signing up for. You can\u2019t just start a blog and post to it. There\u2019s a lot of back work that goes on, not only every day but into every post.\n\nIt takes a lot of time to get a blog off the ground. I must admit, I\u2019m nowhere near where I want to be but I have started to carve out my niche and am starting to find my voice, even though I\u2019m aware I have years of work ahead of me.\n\nKnowing that, I\u2019m always hungry for tools that can help me along the way and guide me into rapid growth. Although I use 10\u2019s of different tools and platforms, these are the ones I think every new blogger should begin with.\n\nThis is a rather new technology but can do wonders for your following. Which means it\u2019s a must-have from the very beginning.\n\nI implemented it a couple of days ago after visiting various websites and thinking that they could really add some benefit in the blogging space.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of mine.\n\nWhen a user visits your blog for the first time, this window will drop down from the top of the website, allowing users to \u2018subscribe\u2019 to your updates. You would have seen them. They show up in the top right corner of your computer, alerting you of updates to websites you\u2019ve visited.\n\nThe reason why they\u2019re a must-have is because of how non-intrusive they are to your readers.\n\nFor one, they\u2019re not like a pop-up. They\u2019re small and don\u2019t disrupt the user experience on your blog.\n\nBut the main point is they don\u2019t require any personal information. No emails, not even a name. The user just clicks a button and that\u2019s it. They\u2019re now subscribed to your blog posts and they never had to give any information.\n\nThis is particularly good for you as well as you don\u2019t have to put the time into developing a newsletter. Every time you post an article, they already know.\n\nSetting push notifications up takes a total of 5 minutes or less.\n\nI use PushEngage. The reason is pretty straightforward. They\u2019re the easiest to use. Here\u2019s a picture of the dashboard.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\nAfter this, your visitors will start getting the dropdown and your followers will start to increase.\n\nI cannot stress this enough.\n\nIf you\u2019re not using Medium, you are screwing yourself over.\n\nIt\u2019s the social media for writers and is a great place to build your following. In fact, most of the connections I\u2019ve made (if not all) have been from Medium.\n\nMedium allows you to post all of your articles to a site full of people hungry for content without affecting SEO ranking due to duplicate content.\n\nJust make sure that when you use it you\u2019re not just posting content. This will get you nowhere. You need to interact, comment and like other peoples content to actually start building your following.\n\nComing up with constant ideas for blog posts is hard. You want to have a steady stream of ideas coming to you and any tool that can help you come up with ideas is amazing.\n\nAnswerThePublic is the tool that does just that.\n\nIt allows you to search any keyword and will give you results of every question that has been searched for relating to the keyword. In this example, I searched \u2018motivation\u2019.\n\nThese are the results I got.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a little confusing due to the number of results, so I changed it to a table view and got this.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to do too much explaining but basically, the site gives you the headers of your articles and what to write about.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t blow your mind, I don\u2019t know what will.\n\nDuring my redesign, I used Moz.com.\n\nI was using it to find all the broken links internally and externally, which allowed me to make sure my blog was still running smoothly and helped me locate anything that needed fixing.\n\nMoz.com also allows you to track how many links are linking to your site, from where and how many are created over any given time period.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with bounce rates which was closely tied to how slow my pages were loading.\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s absolutely horrible. I found out that this was largely due to all my images being way too big.\n\nAmong other issues that increased my bounce rate, this was the main one. So I started looking for a solution and landed on a WordPress plugin called Smush Image Compression and Optimization.\n\nIt will automatically compress your images upon upload. Meaning you don\u2019t need to worry about doing it yourself.\n\nOn top of this, it will also allow you to bulk compress any images that are already on your blog by clicking the \u2018BULK SMUSH\u2019 button on the dashboard.\n\nThis is just one necessary thing you need to do in order to decrease bounce rate and increase time spent on your blog.\n\nGoogle Suggestions is a tool that\u2019s sitting right under our noses but I doubt many people actually use to their advantage.\n\nImagine a way to find out the most frequently search Longtail keywords in your keyword to optimise your blog post. Well, luckily, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nConsider this search, it tells me exactly what people want.\n\nThey want templates on how to set out their goals, so that\u2019s exactly what I did.\n\nI created a step-by-step guide on how people can set out their goals in a way that they\u2019ll be achieved.\n\nOr, consider this one.\n\nThis one tells me exactly what a good blog post could be. Look at the third one down.\n\nGoogle suggestions just gave me my next blog topic.\n\nAs a blogger, you need to utilise Google Suggestions for your SEO and blog posts.\n\nMost people are going to think this is an obvious one and maybe it is, but it still needs to be mentioned.\n\nYoast SEO is a gift for every blogger.\n\nIt allows you to set up your blogs and pages so it\u2019s high quality for SEO. It also provides specific tips, making it easy for you to use.\n\nFor example, here is what\u2019s at the bottom of every post editing page.\n\nYou put in the keyword you want to rank for and it will make suggestions on how you can improve your blog to rank higher.\n\nFor this one, I chose the word \u2018goals\u2019. As you can see, I\u2019ve used it a couple of times but I also know exactly how I can improve the post to better rank for that keyword.\n\nAnother obvious one but very difficult to master.\n\nYes, it is simple to set up but actually getting people to subscribe is hard, especially in the begining.\n\nEmbedding forms on your blog is essential to building your following and I wanted to show you the places I do it, to drastically increase sign-ups while not disrupting the user experience.\n\nThe pop-up is the most useful but only if used correctly. As a general rule, people hate them. They annoy anyone who visits your page and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to determine at what point it should show up.\n\nI\u2019ve tried every option and have had the most success with having the pop-up show when the user goes to leave my site. This means they aren\u2019t interrupted while they are on my blog. Only when leaving.\n\nI embed a subscription box at the bottom of every post. Most people will argue that the best location is the beginning of the post but the way that my sidebar is set up, it would mean there would be 2 subscription boxes next to each other, which is overkill.\n\nI use it because people are more inclined to subscribe after you\u2019ve added value, which is the blog post.\n\nOne in the sidebar is a given. It means there\u2019s always a subscription box, without ever getting in the way.\n\nA subscription page can work wonders for your following. It took me over a year to write the course I wanted to offer and create but when I did, something happened. Over the past 3 days alone, 40 people have subscribed just from my subscription page.\n\nRemeber the Google Suggestions image that suggested \u2018setting goals template\u2019 and \u2018setting goals worksheet\u2019, well here\u2019s my answer.\n\nI developed a course directly relating to those searches and provided it to people for free, if they sign up to my mailing list.\n\nThis is the single best thing you can do, no matter what stage you\u2019re at with your blogging.\n\nPhotoshop for people who have no idea how to design. Or, in other words, people like me.\n\nCanva has served me well and anyone who isn\u2019t using it needs to.\n\nIt has the ability to create anything you need. Facebook images, website banners, book covers, you name it.\n\nNot only this, if you\u2019re just starting out, Canva provides templates for layouts.\n\nTriberr is a huge underdog and one I didn\u2019t think was really worth using but 2 days ago, I looked at my links using Moz.com and it turns out it\u2019s my biggest link traffic generator. Even though I\u2019ve only posted 1 article on it, 1 year ago.\n\nSo I\u2019ll be using it a lot more in the future.\n\nThe idea is, that you pay a little money to post an article, which stays on the site forever. Then people can find your content and click through to your website.\n\nLike I said, I didn\u2019t think it was a great idea.\n\nYou can also join \u2018Tribes\u2019 which are groups of people who have the same interest. A lot like a Facebook group and gives your content the chance to be seen by millions.\n\nThere are so many tools available to bloggers and not taking advantage of them is going to drastically hinder your growth. These 10 are the basics and have been found from a year of researching and trying to figure out what works.\n\nIf you have any others, I\u2019d love to hear from you!"

        "title": "The Simple Formula of Time Management \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Do you have time management challenges? Do you read a lot about time management, but don\u2019t make much progress?\n\nIf you answer yes to those questions, you\u2019re not alone. I was exactly at the same point until I came up with my own system.\n\nWe treat time management as a simple problem. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a combination of several problems. Let\u2019s divide time management into two problems. Then, we\u2019re going to divide each problem into smaller parts.\n\nIf you have a time management problem, you either have a planning problem, a willpower problem, or both. Don\u2019t worry if you have both. I\u2019ve been there as well.\n\nNow that we have the formula, we can work on each component separately. In this post, I\u2019m going to discuss the first two parts of the planning component. I\u2019m going to discuss the third part of planning and willpower in future posts.\n\nDividing a complex problem into smaller problems and solving each part separately is called divide and conquer. It\u2019s an effective problem-solving method.\n\nSolving its small parts separately is much easier than aiming at the big problem. When you solve the small parts, the big problem is solved automatically. Let\u2019s start with the planning part.\n\nI\u2019m going to divide the planning problem into three parts.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to discuss the analysis and prioritization parts. I\u2019m going to discuss the scheduling part in future posts.\n\nThe analysis part involves dividing a big project into smaller tasks. You can consider your life as one big project and divide it into life areas.\n\nThe list above is to give you an idea. Everybody has a different list. Some people have a few items on their lists, others a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you how to divide your life into its components. It\u2019s a decision you have to make. But I recommend dividing your life into areas and focusing on each area separately.\n\nOnce you have the main areas of your life, it\u2019s time to divide them into projects. For example, your job might involve more than one project. Again, work on those projects separately.\n\nNow, go over each project and break it down into tasks. Some of those tasks will be one-off tasks. Others will be repeating tasks.\n\nI can hear you screaming \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of work!\u201d Yes, it is! But you don\u2019t have to do all of it in a single sitting. Moreover, you don\u2019t have to go into detail for each area, for each project, or for each task.\n\nSimply focus on the most urgent and important areas, projects, and tasks. That already involves some prioritization.\n\nIf you can\u2019t divide a life area, project, or task to the point of single sitting activities, you won\u2019t be able to schedule them in a specific timeslot on a given day.\n\nIf you can\u2019t schedule a task, you won\u2019t be able to complete it. As a result, your time management challenges will perpetuate.\n\nWhich Tool Should I Use?\n\nThere are a lot of planning, scheduling, and to-do list tools out there. For the analysis part, keep things simple. Use MS Word.\n\nMS Word has some less known features that make it more than enough to do an analysis like this.\n\nIn the navigation pane, you can use the following functionalities.\n\nAdjust the Width of the Navigation Pane\n\nThe overview of your planning is as important as the details of it. For that reason, you can increase the size of the navigation page up to 50% of the screen.\n\nI prefer the working space to be on the left and the navigation space to be on the right of the screen. You can move the navigation pane if you want to try a different setting than the default one.\n\nThis step is a critical part of scheduling. Which tasks are more important than others in your analysis? Which tasks are less important?\n\nIn a previous post, I explained the Eisenhower Matrix. The Eisenhower Matrix is a method to categorize tasks. It has two dimensions, importance and urgency.\n\nPrioritization means categorizing your tasks according to their importance. The Eisenhower Matrix has two categories in the importance dimension, important and not important.\n\nToday, I want to introduce the ABCDE method. As the name suggests, the ABCDE method has five categories. Each letter stands for a category.\n\nNow, you have to go over your plan and assign a letter to each task.\n\nI first read about the ABCDE method from the book Focal Point by Brian Tracy. I came across the Eisenhower Matrix for the first time in the book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.\n\nThe ABCDE method focuses on the prioritization of tasks. The Eisenhower Matrix also branches out into scheduling with the urgency dimension.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the letter D. It is the most avoided letter in this system. There are two counterarguments against delegation.\n\nIn some cases, lack of money is a legitimate argument, but not always. Think about it from another perspective.\n\nIf your hourly rate is higher than the person you\u2019re going to hire, then it\u2019s only logical to delegate.\n\nMoreover, some people complete a task faster and better than you. There\u2019s a person who helps me with household once a week. They complete the task in half the time that I do. They do a much better job than me. I\u2019m grateful for their work.\n\nSome people want to do everything themselves. You can\u2019t scale your life and business by doing everything yourself.\n\nAs I explained in the post, A Buddhist Monk\u2019s Take on Business, employees are one of the four stakeholders of a business. If you want to get to the next level in your life and business, you have to start delegating some tasks.\n\nCome up with clear requirements in advance and verify the work against those requirements. Once you build trust with your freelancers, you can increase the amount of work you delegate.\n\nTime management is a complex problem. It can be divided into two parts, planning and willpower. Planning can be broken down into analysis, prioritization, and scheduling.\n\nIn the analysis part, we come up with an overview of all the areas of our lives. Then we divide each area into projects, tasks, and action items. In prioritization, we assign different priorities to each task.\n\nDelegation is a critical yet avoided part of time management. If you avoid it because of lack of money, compare your hourly rate with the hourly rate of a freelancer.\n\nIf you avoid delegation because of lack of trust, you can build trust by delegating small tasks and following up on them.\n\nStay tuned for my posts on scheduling and willpower. They are also critical parts of time management."

        "title": "The Minimum Viable Partnership \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Early on the mission is to get things off the ground.\n\nThis document will serve many purposes over its life from garnering interest from unaware stakeholders to capturing your back-of-the-napkin lunch conversations with the other partner manager into a tangible action plan.\n\nA. Overview\n\nWhat is this partnership?\n\nThis section is your elevator pitch. Either it came from you or was approached to you by the other company\u2019s Partner Manager. Ideally for a MVP, you want to be able to explain what this partnership is within a paragraph.\n\nYou want to be able to explain what you\u2019re potentially selling so either side can understand the opportunity. The objective should be clear and it should speak to everyone from an executive to the front-line workers.\n\nWho are we targeting?\n\nYou want to be able to explain what you\u2019re potentially selling and who you are targeting. Which user base will be targeted first?\n\nIn the MVP phase it\u2019s best to keep this into a smaller and more targeted base. The old spray-and-pray model (gather as many partnerships as possible and pray something hits) is becoming more and more obsolete as teams become hyper-focused and accountable for ROI. Work with your Partner Manager in identifying the ideal customer profile that uses both products and work on delivering an exceptional buyer journey.\n\nWith a more controlled user base you\u2019ll be able to predict success if this was scaled up to everyone. You\u2019ll also be able to document challenges and try again with improved strategy if the first test was a failure.\n\nHow will we reach our target market?\n\nThe action in which you will be reaching out to the target market for the potential partnership. This section gets into the first deliverable action that you will be measuring. Some examples for this would be:\n\nWhen will we be launching Phase 1?\n\nStraight forward \u2014 gives both teams a definitive go launch date. Be realistic and hold each other accountable for this date. A ton of partnerships go sideways because the commitment for a launch date is not upheld. Especially for smaller companies trying to work with bigger ones.\n\nThe more you drag on a potential partnership the more likely the larger company will think you\u2019re wasting their time.\n\nThis section is helpful to determine each company\u2019s values within this partnership and to align on objectives. A good alignment would be both companies seeing a partnership\n\nExample of misalignment is if a smaller partner may consider 20 trials a success meanwhile the larger partner is measuring on converted upgrades and needs north of 100.\n\nThis section can help you prioritize partnerships. If predicted conversion is too small in scope then your supporting departments will not consider this a successful test. It will help you understand where to divvy up your busy day and how much resources you should be spending between projects.\n\nGoals\n\nWhat are some hard and soft goals for this partnership? Some examples to help you get started:\n\nSoft Goals:\n\nThese are objective because they are harder to measure but help you gain an understanding of the buyer and their journey.\n\nKey Results\n\nWhat are the KPIs that would consider a \u201cPhase 1\u201d a success? These tie with the goals but document the \u201cbar of success\u201d. Examples would be:\n\nC. Milestones\n\nWhat are actionable items along the way with the appropriate checkpoints?\n\nThis part of the document tends to be the longest. This gets into the Go-To-Market for your partnership and varies greatly depending upon what the two of you are doing. Suggested template for that would be the following:\n\nAnother suggestion would be to have all shared and supported files included within the milestones for documentation. A simple Google Sheets link shared within each milestone will help each partner collaborate a lot easier.\n\nTry to not overcomplicate this part. Remember it\u2019s only the first step \u2014 it\u2019s meant to be a quick action plan for an exciting opportunity."

        "title": "Bot Basics: How A Chatbot Can Grow Your Business \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "I\u2019m kicking off a new blog series following my extensive and undying love for chatbots with personality \u2014 The Bot Basics. Before we get ahead of ourselves and start writing chatbot scripts and building prototypes, there are a few more basics to cover. For example, how can a chatbot grow your business? Who are chatbots for? Who are they not for? Let\u2019s explore.\n\nFirst, what is a chatbot? I like to think of them as micro, conversation-based experiences that live inside of messaging applications, like Facebook Messenger, Twitter DM, Slack, SMS and Voice.\n\nFor a business, we\u2019ll focus on customer acquisition bots. These are the same micro, conversation-based experiences, but instead, they are specifically designed to convert users to customers through targeted advertising. These bots have a specific and measurable goal that\u2019s achieved through automated conversation. In most cases the goals are things like: scheduling a call or appointment, subscribing to a service, purchasing something, or capturing lead information for your business. They grow your business.\n\nSign me up, right? Here\u2019s a few things to ask yourself before you jump to creating a chatbot for your business:\n\nWhat I mean by that is, a user doesn\u2019t want to click on your ad on Facebook or Twitter and have you dive right in to telling them to sign up or download. They want value. They want a carrot. It may be you translating your website\u2019s automatic quote delivery tool into a conversation, offering exclusive insight that can help the customer improve their lives, or give something away for free. Think about what values you can offer to your customer first, and then build an interactive conversation around it.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the benefits of acquiring customers with a chatbot, vs a traditional Facebook ad.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the convenience. 9 out of 10 users want to use messaging to communicate with brands. Let\u2019s give the customers what they want! On SMS, we see 1000s of messages coming in to our bots in the first week. On Facebook, 61% of customers for a 65+ demographic completed the goal of one of our chatbots. The experience a user has on Facebook when they engage with an advertisement is typically a static microsite selling them something. When the ad destination is a chatbot, users can engage in a two way conversation as they learn about your service. They even have fun. Delivering a personalized, consistent brand experience to every single customer that engages with you is invaluable to your business.\n\n47% of users say they would buy an item through a chatbot this year. Our customers have all seen lower acquisition cost when the ad destination is a chatbot (instead of a microsite, website or the app store). And, their customers actually like to use it. 33% of users said they would make a reservation using a chatbot, and 37% would rather buy something through a brand\u2019s Facebook page than their website. Let\u2019s make customers happier.\n\nThe secret sauce of growing your business with a chatbot is owning your users. Once a user engages with your chatbot, you do not need to pay to contact them. For 24 hours, you can send that user unlimited messages (which should be an engaging, two-way conversation), and remind them to pick up where they left off. After that day, you get 1 more message at any time (for free) to re-engage the user. Use it wisely! Think of creative ways to encourage the user to return to your bot and reply to you to refresh the 24+1 \u2014 Save the message for their birthday, a huge promotion, or update on their order, and be sure to ask a question that has at minimum, a yes or no answer.\n\nReady to grow your business with a chatbot? Check out the handy infographic below that explains all of the basics we covered in this post. Share it with your friends and coworkers, and stay tuned for my next post in The Basics where I\u2019ll reveal my tips for a customer acquisition bot that people actually want to use."

        "text": "Since the birth of humankind, people have found innovative ways to cope with their fear of death. Some civilizations have Heaven and Hell. Some believe in karma and cycles of rebirth. Silicon Valley, of course, has technology.\n\nIn 1994, a group of transhumanists called the Extropians hosted their first official gathering in Sunnyvale, California to discuss their big ideas, like cryopreservation and the possibility of uploading human consciousness to the cloud. The Extropians aspired to transform society by augmenting human potential, their mission based in the audacious belief that \u201cbiology [is no longer] destiny: with genetic engineering, biology is under human control.\u201d\n\nBy 2007, the World Transhumanist Association had moved to Palo Alto. They set up shop alongside similar organizations including the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Foresight Nanotech Institute in Menlo Park. Evidently, the heart of the Valley was the perfect incubator for nurturing these outlandish ventures.\n\nIn fact, many of today\u2019s most prominent tech visionaries and entrepreneurs have elevated transhumanism from a fringe philosophy to the mainstream. In a world where living a long and fulfilling life is more accessible than ever, the successful have found themselves caught by an ever-present anxiety about not having accomplished enough \u2014 about not having maximized one\u2019s full potential. That unease seems to be the driving force behind Silicon Valley\u2019s transhumanist projects.\n\nAlphabet CEO Larry Page launched Calico Labs in 2013, receiving a billion dollars in funding to tackle aging through \u201cspeculative\u201d new technologies, potentially including gene therapy. Calico is equipped with an impressive team of researchers recruited from top medical schools, universities, and public-interest research centers, yet remains suspiciously vague about their actual research.\n\nMeanwhile, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel is known for his fascination with parabiosis, young-to-old blood transfusions that aim to boost health in the face of old age. But the clinical trials for parabiosis have been oddly exclusive, charging participants a hefty $8000 for a single plasma treatment without any guarantor of success. And it seems a bit hypocritical for Thiel \u2014 the proclaimed champion of people who \u201cmake something new\u201d and go from \u201czero to one\u201d \u2014 to be this concerned with his own preservation. After all, believing one\u2019s existence to be indispensable to the world requires a sizable dose of hubris."

        "text": "How to Have Fun Networking By Using an Authentic Personal Pitch 10 Simple Steps to Share Your Story With Confidence\n\nYou don\u2019t have to think about the elevator pitch as a boring pitch that\u2019s meant to sell you and your services.\n\nInstead, think of it as a short statement that makes whoever you\u2019re talking to want to know more about you.\n\nFor instance, the elevator pitch I use to tell people what I do is carefully put together.\n\nI\u2019ve modified it over time and it works well when I\u2019m networking because it sparks conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly fluid but I usually say something along the lines of:\n\nI like mine because it\u2019s fairly broad and lends itself well to discussion. I don\u2019t always say I\u2019m a \u201cMusicpreneur.\u201d It\u2019s a bit show-off-y to invent words to describe yourself, I\u2019m very aware of that :)\n\nI can call myself a musician, audio engineer, entrepreneur, author, or producer (musicpreneur does cover those pretty well though don\u2019tcha think)? But depending on who I\u2019m talking to, one of those descriptions might make more sense to keep the conversation going.\n\nBut enough about me, let\u2019s dig into how you can construct your elevator pitch. You can use a variation of these 10 steps to craft an elevator pitch for your business and/or product but for the purpose of this article it\u2019s intended for you to describe yourself as a professional.\n\nDon\u2019t just say \u201cI\u2019m a broker\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a teacher\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a scientist.\u201d\n\nThat leaves nothing to talk about. It doesn\u2019t give the other person anything to ask about.\n\nSaying \u201cI\u2019m a high-school teacher\u201d is better because it includes a little bit of detail for the other person to ask about.\n\nThey might tell you a horror story about their high-school years that you\u2019re not interested in, but at least you helped start a conversation.\n\nWhat you do isn\u2019t your job, but your job is still a part of what you do and who you are.\n\nHowever, people don\u2019t always like talking about their 9\u20135 jobs and if you\u2019re one of them you might want to pivot your elevator pitch to the other aspects of who you are.\n\nIf you are a high-school teacher but can\u2019t stand another story about high-school then talk about who you are otherwise.\n\nAre you a part-time novelist? Are you a musician? Do you create robots at Xerocraft?\n\nPassion is contagious and it\u2019ll help the flow of the conversation. You\u2019ll have much more fun than if you\u2019re always trying to avoid talking about the job you hate.\n\nSimon Sinek\u2019s Start With Why is a great book that talks about the importance of having a why behind what you do.\n\nMy \u201cwhy,\u201d if you will, is helping people succeed and make an impact with their creations.\n\nThe \u201conline\u201d part in my elevator pitch is my \u201chow.\u201d Through Audio Issues and BBenediktsson.com I engage with over 31,000 home studio musicians every week.\n\nDo you have a particularly unique way of doing things?\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur you might have a different take on how you solve a particular problem for your audience.\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur, knowing your target market is crucial.\n\nSpecifying your market in your elevator pitch can be beneficial because the other person will then know what your area of expertise is when it comes to both what you do and who you do it for.\n\nAs with any conversation, being able to continue talking is key.\n\nThe thing about your elevator pitch is that it should be an introduction to you and what you do. But it\u2019s really only a tiny glimpse into who you are.\n\nThink of it as the tip of the iceberg. If the other person seems interested in your area of expertise then you shouldn\u2019t have any difficulty with elaborating on any aspect of your day-to-day professional life.\n\nI can talk about audio engineering, music and marketing for hours so if I hit common ground with my fellow collocutor then chances are we\u2019ll have a great conversation.\n\nI realize that being ultra-prepared and methodical with your elevator pitch might seem a little too robotic.\n\nSo don\u2019t just tell your elevator pitch in a monotone voice like you\u2019re HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey. It doesn\u2019t always have to be the same exact sentence.\n\nBe a little more human and casual about it while still covering all the things you need to cover in order to keep the conversation flowing.\n\nDepending on the audience and the event you\u2019re at, you might want some variation in your elevator pitch.\n\nLike I said before, when I\u2019m at a music conference, I focus more on the topic of music and audio. Conversely, whenever I\u2019m at a small business networking event, I like to talk about the online business and marketing aspect of what I do.\n\nThink about who your audience is and tailor your elevator pitch to them. It\u2019ll make your conversations easier.\n\nEvents and networking should be fun. You shouldn\u2019t be scared of talking about yourself, but you also shouldn\u2019t hog the conversation."

        "text": "The 7 Best Small Business Tools for Under $20/mo I\u2019m a sucker for things that save me time.\n\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of lists out there with free tools for small businesses, sometimes you just have to pay a little to get quality. Here\u2019s the top 7 tools I\u2019m using that are low price, but deliver high value.\n\nNothing screams \u201cmy business isn\u2019t well established\u201d like using a free email service, and having your email look like businessname@yahoo.com. Switching to a business email is incredibly easy to do, and setting up aliases (so you can also have support@, sales@, info@ email addresses) is included.\n\nPlus, the unlimited cloud storage on the $10/mo plan has replaced Dropbox for us \u2014 a service which I despise.\n\nI really wish I had used this before tax season, it makes keeping up with your finances a breeze. Automatically sort your transactions into various buckets, track profitability, classify mileage, and see what your quarterly tax burden is instantly.\n\nManaging social media for yourself and your business can easily turn into a full-time job if you let it. With Buffer, you can easily schedule posts in advance and use their curation tools to find relevant content worth sharing.\n\nThis one might not be for everyone, but if you\u2019re doing your own design work for your business it\u2019s pretty much essential. For $10/mo, you get access to hundreds of thousands of high quality iconography that you can use without restrictions. Really worth it to give your website a look that most free resources can\u2019t compete with.\n\nI use this to wireframe websites, make graphics for my articles, and create visuals that convey my thoughts better than words alone can. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d use this as much as I do, but I find myself opening it up 3\u20135 times a week now.\n\nWhile MailChimp does have a free plan, if you\u2019re looking for more advanced automation (like a sequence of emails sent out over the course of a week whenever someone joins a list), you\u2019re going to want to upgrade to the Growing Business Plan. Working with their emails templates is pretty easy, and the form integrations make growing your list easy.\n\nI hate going back and forth to decide when a good time to meet with someone, or do a call is. Instead, I just send them a Calend.ly link and they can pick a time on my calendar that suits them. I like the $8/mo plan, so I can have different meeting lengths but if you\u2019re only scheduling things in a single increment (half hour, hour, etc\u2026) you can probably get away with the free plan."

        "text": "Blockchain Technology will make its impact in many industries. Do not fear it. Understand it. Embrace it.\n\nSome now-famous (or infamous) digital currency, named \u201cBitcoin\u201d made national media headlines hitting new highs towards the end of 2017.\n\nFor some, it was the first time hearing about Bitcoin only to immediately cash in for the hopes of making a quick buck. For others who have been aware of its technology since its founding nearly a decade ago, it marked a turning point for what is to come.\n\nBitcoin has become the symbol for cryptocurrencies, however, what is more important is to understand its underlying technology, and its major impact moving forward.\n\nThe technology known as blockchain is a powerful force set to disrupt many industries with its integration and one that should be commonly understood.\n\nBlockchain technology is simply a digitized, public, secure list of transactions, providing a more transparent record organized in blocks that are linked together sequentially.\n\nThe technology can be broken down in to two fundamental components:\n\nThe decentralized network presents unique opportunities and is moreover, secure and transparent. Parties can share data and execute transactions, without having to rely on any central authority acting as a clearing house in the way, for instance, typical banks do in daily transactions.\n\nThe blockchain itself replaces the third party allowing for direct transactions to take place.\n\nLedger is a term used in the traditional accounting world, and defined as a book or other collection of financial accounts/transactions of a particular type.\n\nIn blockchain technology, its ledger, or recording of those transactions is the key unique feature. It provides a digital record of each transaction and provides information about who owns what at any time.\n\nAnyone on the network are able to see the record of those transactions. This distributed ledger is replicated on thousands of computers around the world and is publicly available. The special feature about the technology is for all its transparency, the data is trustworthy and secure. Once the data is entered into the blockchain, it can never be erased, allowing for much easier and transparent reconciliation.\n\nThe technology can work for almost every type of transaction involving value (i.e. Money, Goods, Property, etc.) and it is its decentralization and distributed network that makes the technology so special.\n\nNo third parties are able to serve as gatekeepers to the internet and able to interfere and control that data such as the banking or high technological firms a la Facebook and Google.\n\nThe distributed network also does not allow for the record of data and transactions to be stored in a single location, allowing everyone on the network to see the record of transactions. This allows for the potentiality to eliminate increasingly pressing issues in today\u2019s digital/cyber world, such as fraud.\n\nThe technological foundation\u2019s potential is nearly limitless, allowing for otherwise inconvenient transactions such as wiring funds to another country to be instant and quick without a middle-man such as a bank abusing the process. For instance, banks especially in international transfers hold funds for days and charge fees to either party.\n\nThe transaction would be direct.\n\nThere is strong expectation that blockchain would become the mainstream. It is not a matter of if, but when. According to a 2015 report conducted by the World Economic Forum, data polled at the time held on blockchain, accounts for 0.025% of global GDP at the time with an expectation to rise to 10% of global GDP by 2027.\n\nAlthough there is more of an awareness and coverage about the technology in 2018, future planning harnessing the technology is severely lacking.\n\nIn fact, a whopping 77% of CIOs surveyed by Gartner in its 2018 CIO Survey, stated that their respective organization has no interest in the technology and/or planning to take no action to either investigate or develop it.\n\nAs we move towards a more progressive, peer-sharing economy \u2014 major industries such as banking, healthcare, education, real estate and the legal industries are ripe for disruption.\n\nThese industries have set themselves up for disruption especially more so, since many have admitted that currently there is no action being taken to deal with it or integrate it.\n\nConsumer economic and market behavior may end up forcing that change and many firms will end up being blindsided."

        "title": "How To Write A Book Like You Would Develop A Product",
        "text": "I started a new project in March 2018, which was to write a book about investments in cryptocurrencies. The project serves to document and share what I have learnt over the past year of trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn my previous article, Episode 1: The Idea and Preliminary Research, I wrote about how I started on this project. Now in Phase 2, I wanted to stay true to the agile methodology, and have incorporated the concept of a sprint into my writing process.\n\nA sprint is a defined period of time in which work is done and reviewed. The idea of a sprint is to break down the overall goal of developing a product into smaller, micro goals.\n\nA team can prioritise different implementations of a product and break them down into sprints to complete. Depending on the evaluation at the end of a sprint, the team can continue to work on that component, or choose to work on another goal.\n\nBefore you embark on a sprint, it is important to have a designated set of objectives to evaluate upon. A sprint is designed to be short, but it has to be comprehensive enough so that the objectives can be measured meaningfully.\n\nI had set off on this sprint with the goal of writing a complete content, which will be my first draft. After which, I will send the draft to a few friends to read and review, particularly on the following aspects:\n\nThe writing process took me 2.5 weeks \u2014 slightly longer than expected. I was really stressed up midway about not being able to meet my deadline. I had to take a couple of day offs to convince myself that I am the master of my timeline, and that the stress was self-inflicted.\n\nThe review and feedback from three friends took a total of 1.5 weeks. It was considerably short, given that they had to finish reading 22,000 words of unpolished content and then give their feedback on it.\n\nOn hindsight, I could have split the sprint into two sections \u2014 the first half and second half of the book. While my reviewers are reading the first half, I could be working on the second. Splitting up the content might also make it more digestable for them.\n\nOne feedback that I have gotten was that the content was \u201ctoo packed\u201d, and that he felt tired from being constantly bombarded with new information, even if it was clear and easy to understand. It made me realise that the way I wrote, where I hurriedly unpacked and offloaded information into a content outline, has negatively impacted the flow of the content.\n\nMoving forward, while a one-month period for a sprint cycle seems achievable, I might have compromised on quality in a bid to complete the sprint. Writing is after all a creative process, and I could go in a bottom-up fashion of writing rather than focusing on filling up the content.\n\nUpon the review, I have also managed to (in)validate some assumptions that I had regarding my prospective readers.\n\nPreviously, my assumption was that readers wanted to (i)understand and know about blockchain, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies better, so that (ii) they can feel confident about investing in it, and thereafter (iii)make money from investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt was a knowledge objective, that led to an attitude objective, and then to a behavioural objective. Pretty intuitive right? Not so.\n\nI realised that the reader\u2019s primary objective is money \u2014 to grow their wealth by investing into cryptocurrencies. Thereafter, it is social reputation \u2014 being able to tell others that they know about cryptocurrency, and that they have invested and profited from it.\n\nMy prospective reader is not someone who is hearing about cryptocurrencies for the first time. Instead, they have already heard and know something about it. Whether that information is accurate or not is not of importance.\n\nMy prospective reader wants to get started on cryptocurrencies already. Hence, I do not actually have to do much to educate (knowledge objective) them or to convince them about the investment. They are somewhat sold already; I just need to push the right triggers.\n\nIf we were to liken it to new electronics, these people are the ones who are already fiddling around with the gadget, and are somewhat convinced that it works. They do not know exactly how it works, and they may never know, but they still want to get an idea, so that they can operate the gadget correctly, effectively and confidently.\n\nMy initial objective of wanting to empower my readers so that they can feel confident about investing in cryptocurrencies, has not changed.\n\nInstead, I have better recognised the needs of my prospective readers, and I can then develop the product (the book) to better accommodate their needs. This means a rework of the content structure, as well as a tweak in my writing process so that I can create more space for readers to breathe.\n\nI took a one-month \u201csprint\u201d to deliver this prototype and to get the feedback, from which I can improve upon my first draft. As I start on my next sprint, I am looking forward to test out the new assumptions with a different set of audience. I shall also adapt my sprint process to be more fluid on the deadlines and not let that affect the creative process of writing. Onwards!"

And the best way I\u2019ve found to do that is by building relationships with other writers in or close to my niche who have a similar size following as I do. It\u2019s hard to over-emphasize how rewarding (and motivating) it is to have a core group of peers you admire responding to and encouraging you in your work. This is INVALUABLE!\n\nHere are a few tips for getting started:\n\nBefore hitting publish on a new article, my final test is always to ask one simple question before reading it a final time: Is this ruthlessly helpful? A surprising amount of the time my answer to this question is no.\n\nFor a while I simply hit publish anyway with article that was of mediocre helpfulness, and let me tell you, the results were not good! On the other hand, when I\u2019ve taken the time to go back over an article and re-frame things or add new bits here and there, I almost always get a huge return on that investment.\n\nA few thoughts on being ruthlessly helpful:\n\nMaarten van Doorn has a great piece on quality and quantity that everyone should read. After reflecting a lot on this question and doing my own experiments over the past few months with emphasizing quality vs quantity, here\u2019s my conclusion: When in doubt choose quality. I think the long-term return on this is probably higher.\n\nBut here are a few more specifics on this point:\n\nI hope you found this article helpful and encouraging. Thoughts?

Since then I\u2019ve been applying some of its strategies and the early results are very promising. And now everyone can benefit because Benjamin\u2019s book came out in March.\n\nWPDW challenges the notion that the only way to succeed is by having a phenomenal force of will, i.e. willpower. However, this carefully crafted book demonstrates from countless research, case studies and some of Benjamin\u2019s own, and at times, very personal, experiences that changing our environments is the way to success. And when we do step into new environments we will become the product of that changed setting. Therefore, we are not the sole cause of our success \u2014 it\u2019s the right surroundings that help us to evolve effectively.\n\nAnd because we are all capable of changing our environments the ideas in the book dispel the myth that people from less privileged backgrounds cannot succeed relative to those who are predisposed to more opportunities."

I was lucky that I didn\u2019t need surgery.\n\nFor the next 8 weeks, I could not walk.\n\nNot anymore, I could only tolerate some weights and ab work.

Intense focus by acting on your long-term goals of life, no matter the circumstance.\n\nGiving up is never an answer.\n\nWithout strong willpower, it is inevitable that life will overwhelm you.

        "text": "Articles explicate the downsides of consuming Coca-Cola, the product, but the demand persists. At least some aspect of this enduring want must correlate to the narrative surrounding consumption of the product (this is leaving aside the addictive nature of the caffeine and sugar).\n\nOkay, so, to be fair, the above image is independently produced (and I assume the image is not part of Coca-Cola\u2019s marketing budget \u2014 the image fits the brand narrative, nonetheless \u2014 classic, iconic, enjoyable). But the company spends billions on advertising, preserving the iconic nature of that brand.\n\nWhen you think of polar bears, do you think of Coca-Cola? When you think of Saint Nicholas, do you think of Coca-Cola? The enduring narratives surrounding the brand have irrevocably altered the nature of our collective recollection of images. In part, I think this has something to do with the ubiquity of those images, and with the ubiquitousness of that brand in those contexts. But still, the iconography was created intentionally, with attention paid to the quality of the campaigns.\n\nIn this instance, culture has changed around a product. This idea of reality-altering marketing brings me to the central question of this piece: what are the basics of creating a brand?\n\nI should, at this point, distance myself from what I\u2019m writing right now. I mean what I\u2019m saying somewhat satirically. I am not a marketing expert (though I have worked to develop the presence of some brands, including my own artistic pursuits). Still, I\u2019ve learned what follows from chasing an understanding of the story behind a company, cause, or organization. Here are four steps to narrative brand management; i.e., how to Coca-Cola your company.\n\nThis is a critical aspect of telling that company\u2019s story. If you are developing a narrative behind why someone should adopt a certain product, it is, in my mind, a fundamental tactical blunder not to understand what that product offers to consumers.\n\nIn the case of Coca-Cola, I don\u2019t know, buy a six pack of the product, and see how you feel after draining every can or bottle over the course of a few hours. Okay, maybe not that. I would imagine you might be jittery, with an ensuing caffeine/sugar crash a few hours later. Not ideal.\n\nLet\u2019s use instead, as an example, a startup that focuses on the mobilization of protest movements for progressive causes (I had this idea at one point). How does the platform function? Is it based on text messages? On an online message board? Is it a standalone app with a large, highly-active, potential user base?\n\nThis is crucial. What gap is the company filling? In the case of Coca-Cola, maybe it\u2019s boredom, or a late-in-the-day pick-me-up, or a pointless aside to an already overburdened lunch. Or perhaps (and I think this is less likely) a photographer wants to create an iconic shot, and positions a model with a perfectly placed bottle of Coca-Cola. This would be an instance of culture shifting around brand.\n\nPut in a more serious context: maybe progressives who want to mobilize need a push from community to do so. An organizing element might be exactly what\u2019s needed to catalyze the kind of support to make this company tenable.\n\nIn this case, what seems to be missing from the market is a viable way to get people into the streets, into town halls, in front of their legislators, knowing they will have the support of like-minded individuals. So the gap in the market, put simply, is the following: community-oriented political action, as a kind of assured element of that political action.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, an admittedly established brand, maybe this audience is everyone with a pulse. Though, as a thought experiment, I want to return to the time when Coca-Cola was beginning its incursion into popular culture.\n\nAt this earlier point, the company was certainly trying to appeal to a wide audience through Saint Nicholas and polar bears (who doesn\u2019t like the holidays and a thrill from the arctic?). But there was still a sort of segmentation by season, likely boosting sales during the winter months.\n\nOkay, returning to the political mobilization group, the core audiences would seem to be folks who need community to catalyze action, and folks who seek a platform to lead political action. Here, numbers are key \u2014 images of people, together, engaged in action toward the same goal. This brings me to my final point.\n\nWe already know how Coca-Cola does this. Print, television, internet, radio, etc., etc. Though initially, the placement had to have been more modest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the whole picture, though. To that end, how would the political group accomplish this goal?\n\nWe have the narrative (community-centered political action). And we have the core audience: people at two poles of political involvement. All that is left is to find a way both to communicate to an audience on the cusp of political involvement, and with a network of leadership that can push the movement forward.\n\nCue photos, stories \u2014 compellingly worded reasons for involvement. To me, creating a brand is less about the product itself, as it appears objectively in reality, and, somewhat paradoxically, more about the narrative behind what\u2019s possible with that product playing a role in one\u2019s day-to-day life.\n\nWhether or not that narrative sticks is likely a function of the amount of marketing resources that are devoted to that narrative. Even so, it\u2019s still worthwhile to communicate a compelling story, I think, whether that story remains an element of an under-explored subculture, or becomes part of a brand that eventually alters popular culture."

        "text": "How to treat your employees right \u2013 without all the flashy stuff and a designer office\n\nTreating your employees right does not mean giving them a nice office with designer furniture, an expensive company cell phone and generous meal allowance. Actually you should go back to the basics. I have worked in both Sweden and Hong Kong, you may want to learn from my experience.\n\nWhen I was working in Hong Kong, working long hours symbolises hard working. Long hours does not mean 9 hours a day without a break, it means working from 6 in the morning till mid-night, you have your three meals at the office, in front of your computer. You do not leave before your boss and you have to start your day before him or her. Some companies have a shower room or two in their office building, it is not for a shower after a workout. It is for the staff who work overnight.\n\nMajority of the people stay behind and work extra just to please their boss. Some work extra because they have too much on their plate but they have no idea that working long hours like this does not help but affects their productivity, let alone potential health issues in a long run.\n\nIn Sweden, quite on the contrary, employers are against working long hours. It is standard to work 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. You can work extra if you want to but working overtime does not mean you are hardworking and there is no guarantee that you will have a pay rise because of that.\n\nBoth countries have very different work culture in terms of working hours but one thing in common \u2014 businesses operate as usual, long working hours does not make businesses more successful and profitable. So why building a toxic work culture to encourage your employees to work until they drop \u2014 or quit?\n\nIn Hong Kong, it is quite common that you go to work even when you are sick. You cough, you sneeze and even you are running a high fever, you have to show up at work if you want to keep your job. Working while you are sick affects the quality and being physically at the office with a fever, you are actually trying to infect your co-workers. (unless this is your purpose!)\n\nIn Sweden, if you are sick, you stay at home. Period. If you are on sick leave for long, the state will take care of you, you don\u2019t have to worry about your job, your finance or your medical bills. There is no such thing in Hong Kong. If you are sick, unless you have some sort of private insurance, you have to worry about everything. Literally.\n\nWhat should you do as a boss? First and foremost, be considerate. People can get sick. Secondly, try to offer more than what the law says. Guess what \u2014 the extra pay sick days can improve loyalty and turnover rate.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me, there are lots of moms and dads in Hong Kong. It is possible to have a family in Hong Kong, very possible but it comes with a price. Housing is crazily expensive, as you may have heard of. However, how does work affect family life in Hong Kong? Let\u2019s start from the very beginning \u2014 maternity leave.\n\nHow many weeks of maternity leave a mom entitles? \n\n10 weeks. How is that possible? Most babies are still screaming through the night (not sleeping through the night!). Well, that\u2019s the family\u2019s problem, not the company\u2019s.\n\nWhen the child is older, it\u2019s natural that he or she can get sick from time to time. What can a parent in Hong Kong do? \n\nTake a holiday to look after a sick child. The average holiday entitlement? 7\u201314 days depending on the number of years you have worked for your employer.\n\nIn Sweden, both parents share 480 days of maternity (or parental) leave in each pregnancy. When your child is sick, you do not work, the state pays you 80% of your salary so that you can stay home until your child recovers.\n\nAre you curious about what other companies offer to their employees? Take a look at this chart, it is made by Fairygodboss.com. Netflix offers 52 paid weeks of maternity leave, Spotify and Etsy \u2014 26 paid weeks. Those extra weeks mean a lot to the parents!\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to have a meeting with all your employees to discuss the work conditions and get their feedback and expectations. The meeting is a very good opportunity to develop a great relationship with your employees. If a meeting is not feasible, perhaps you can start with a survey, then share the result and don\u2019t forget your action plan. As a leader, you need to walk the talk, that means you need to be the example, not working long hours, trying to achieve work-life balance. If there is too much on your plate? Hire extra help and delegate. Good work conditions mean a happy workplace. A happy workplace improves productivity. High productivity means greater profit. Isn\u2019t that the ultimate goal?"

All the business logic is inside the chaincode.\n\nRight now, it can be written in Go / Node.JS.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, chaincode is the \u2018smart contract\u2019 that runs on the peers and creates transactions. More broadly, it enables users to create transactions in the Hyperledger Fabric network\u2019s shared ledger and update the world state of the assets.\n\nChaincode is programmable code, written in Go, and instantiated on a channel. Developers use chaincode to develop business contracts, asset definitions, and collectively-manage decentralized applications. The chaincode manages the ledger state through transactions invoked by applications. Assets are created and updated by a specific chaincode, and cannot be accessed by another chaincode.\n\nApplications interact with the blockchain ledger through the chaincode. Therefore, the chaincode needs to be installed on every peer that will endorse a transaction and instantiated on the channel.\n\nThere are two ways to develop smart contracts with Hyperledger Fabric:"

        "text": "What do you want to be remembered for?\n\nThis is a question I recently heard posed to Gary Vaynerchuk.\n\nMost people would stutter or collect themselves with such a philosophical question. Not Gary.\n\n51/49 means that in every relationship (business or personal), he wants to give at least 51% of the value. Why? He wants to have an impact, leave a legacy. Not to mention that there is serious ROI from putting others first.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t just say this, he lives it. He has made a career on giving away his best secrets for free, constantly putting out quality content and responding to fans on email and social media one by one.\n\nHe spends ungodly hours scaling the unscalable because of the 51/49 principle. That\u2019s dedication.\n\nGary\u2019s point makes a lot of sense. How much better would your life be if you decided to go all-in on the value you provide? I picture myself with closer relationships, making more money and being genuinely more fulfilled.\n\nThis seems good in theory but to go out of your way to add value in every situation is a LOT of work.\n\nHere are a few ways you can do it:\n\nWrite a handwritten note \u2014 When is the last time you wrote a thank you letter to a customer or someone who has personally helped you?\n\nPut the phone down \u2014 There\u2019s no need to be on Instagram while you\u2019re in line getting a sandwich. Look up and talk to the cashier like a normal person. If you\u2019re meeting with someone or eating a meal with them, put the phone away. Give them your undivided attention.\n\nCreate content \u2014 Find something you love to do or that you\u2019re good at and share that passion with the world. It\u2019s intimidating at first, but people WANT to hear from their peers.\n\nFollow-up \u2014 People say it in sales all the time: Under-promise, over-deliver. But how often do we really follow-up sooner than we say we will or provide more detail than the bare minimums?\n\nMake connections \u2014 People love a matchmaker. Who are two people that you know that would get a ton of value from meeting each other? Connect them. If they find value, they\u2019ll always remember it and it costs you absolutely nothing.\n\nShare your ideas \u2014 This is a concept that Gary is very fond of: giving your best ideas away for free. Why? Because everyone will love you for it and 99% of people will be too lazy to act on it anyway.\n\nThe list can go on and on but I think you get the point.\n\nIf I was asked the question, I\u2019d say that I want to be remembered as someone that maximized their full potential and helped others do the same along the way.\n\nSo what am I doing today?\n\nI meditated. I\u2019m writing this article to (hopefully) inspire you and make you think. I\u2019m going to make a ton of phone calls for my sales job. I\u2019m getting new guests for my podcast. I\u2019m going to work out. I\u2019m taking my girlfriend out on a date.\n\nSimple stuff \u2014 but if I can get 1% better at all of those things today, I will be moving in the right direction.\n\nWhat do YOU want to be remembered for? If it\u2019s similar to Gary, you have some easy ways to apply the 51/49 principle right now.\n\nIt could very likely be something else \u2014 making a ton of money, being a great parent, serving the homeless \u2014 the list is infinite.\n\nKeep that #1 goal top of mind. Let it guide your decisions."

In fact, the struggle never ends.\n\nBefore you can move on to the next step of anything, you always need to struggle.\n\nHere\u2019s what Zinedine Zidane said in an interview with the press, after Real Madrid hardly made it through the semi-finals of the Champions League against Bayern Munich:\n\nI think that there is a lot of truth in this (seemingly) simple quote.\n\nFirst of all, it shows that no matter where you are standing right now (even if you are one of the best in the world), struggle is always a part of the process of moving forward.\n\nSecondly, it shows that anxiety is part of the process, for every single person in the world. And that this anxiety can easily have its toll on your body.\n\nThirdly, it shows that it is exactly this struggle, which makes the process worth it in the end. It is because you have been going through this long time of struggle, that you get to appreciate your achievements much more."

        "title": "Scientific affordability of Space Colonization \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Our planet, Earth, is around 4.543 billion years old. In the backdrop of the cosmic calendar, the human race is at most a toddler. Yet, as a specie, we have affected our home world more than any other earth based flora or fauna has ever done. Our ancestors began in Africa and the thirst for knowledge, and perseverance has carried us to be what we are today. Among everything we aspire for, there is a grand ambition for space colonization. This ambition is not only fueled by \u201cfantastical demands\u201d but by \u201cgenuine need\u201d as well; the earth might not be able to sustain the rate at which we are consuming the natural resources. Thus, one of the prime aims of space exploration is to find an ideal extraterrestrial environment which would be necessary for the survival of our Earth based species the day our planet gives up. Since necessity is the mother of invention, one must look into the potential of our present technological advancements.\n\nIn order to settle down on an alien planet, the first and foremost condition that needs to be met is a habitat. Encapsulating almost all the other needs, in one way or the other, an ideal habitat is required to maintain the sufficient air pressure, environmental composition of gases (especially oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen), tolerable temperature, and it must protect the beings from harmful radiations. Humans, who plan on beginning a colony and build a suitable habitat for others to follow, would face a tricky situation. Being the first of the settlers, they would need huge accommodations with life-support systems and supplies as planets like Mars, which has been speculated to be the first planet where human race might settle after Earth, demand loads of terrestrial changes. As of now, all the planets in our solar system, which have been flagged for possible colonization, possess a solid crust. But all of them are found be hostile and barren, with most of them lacking liquid water and oxygen. This situation asks for a gargantuan terraforming which, consequently, requires large scale transportation of heavy machinery to the destination planet. But as anyone can guess, such transportation won\u2019t be as easy as terrestrial transportation seems to be. Landing heavy loads on any planet is a huge challenge. It takes a lot of fuel to travel to Mars, and that\u2019s one of our closest neighbors. Based on current technologies, to travel the distance between Mars and Earth, it takes several months to a year. Questions have been asked about the worth of money to be spent on such a mission and its fruit-fullness. But these people tend to ignore the possibilities and glorious outcomes such mission might provide our race with. When it comes to military spending, countries are willing to spend every bit of penny. 1)The United States of America had spent almost $610 billion in military in the year 2014; that is more than enough for one Mars mission!\n\nOnce the building of the habitat is done with, the next requirement which must be full-filled is continuous water supply. On Earth, a person needs to drink two liters of water per day. Apart from the need to quench thirst, water is also used in farming, washing, industries etc. 2) In India, for a communities with population over 100,000, the water usage is around 150\u2013200 liters per head per day. Thus, if a colony has ten people, they\u2019d collectively need 1500\u20132000 liters of water daily. Shipping water on the basis of simple speculation won\u2019t be a sensible thing to do. Thus, if we can\u2019t ship such a huge amount of water frequently, then one has to make it.\n\nBringing surplus amount of water to meet long term needs is not feasible; one can bring hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The Sabatier reactor system, installed in ISS, works on the principle that at high temperature and pressure, hydrogen and carbon dioxide turn into methane and water. This water can be used for various purposes while the byproduct, i.e. methane, can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon, the latter being a waste product. This alone won\u2019t suffice the needs of water though. One could suggest retrieval of water from bodies similar to the NEOs (Near Earth Objects) but the assumption of such bodies being existent and the underlying procedure both will be quite inefficient. Thus, we must have the mechanism to recycle water in extraterrestrial habitats- a closed loop in which waste water is turned into its drinkable water.\n\n3)Remarkably, researchers from the University of Manchester discovered that thin membrane of graphene can be an excellent filter of water. Scientists hope to be able to turn impure water into freshwater with devices which use this graphene filter in the near future, which will be greatly beneficial in the water management in such colonies and settlements. But for this, an initial team would definitely need to carry certain amount of water to be recycled. A colony can also try to extract water from a possible underground resource or polar caps in planets like Mars. This task would again need high-tech and heavy machinery in order to get executed in large scale.\n\nWater also acts as a source of oxygen. The process of electrolysis can be used to break down water molecules to produce oxygen and hydrogen. NASA is developing amazing technologies to retrieve oxygen from atmospheric byproducts. Such techniques can help the space colonies to have surplus amount of oxygen.\n\n4)After water and oxygen, comes another factor of grave importance- food. Since the approach towards space colonization is palpable now, the scientific community is working hard on a solution for the availability of food (out of earth) \u2014 cultivation of plant life in outer space and farming their own food on another planet that has a different ecosystem than that of Earth\u2019s. 5)Scientists at the University of Arizona\u2019s Controlled Environment Agriculture Centre (CEAC) are trying to come up with a method to grow plants without the use of soil; in water using a process known as hydroponic growth. In this method, several tubular structures are used to act as greenhouses that would be buried planet\u2019s surface. This would protect the seeds and the saplings from the harmful cosmic radiation and micrometeorites. As such, the buried \u201cgreenhouse\u201d would differ from conventional greenhouse that let in and capture sunlight as heat. After deploying and getting water running through these structures, scientists are claiming that vegetables can be grown within thirty days. This mechanism will be guided by robotic components and complex algorithms which will analyze and collect data using sensors, and then optimize the procedure accordingly using a controlled system. Studying the soils on the celestial bodies also let scientists analyze the data and formulate appropriate methods to grow crops on these planets.\n\nIn 2008, NASA\u2019s \u2018Phoenix Mars Lander\u2019 performed the first wet chemistry experiment using Martian soil. Researchers found magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride in the sample. It was also found that the soil was alkaline. This type of data is important in order to determine which planet would be the best candidate when it comes to extraterrestrial farming as food requirements by the population of any such colony should not differ at all from those on earth and the colonists should be healthy and active.\n\nIt can\u2019t possibly be ignored that to run such a technologically advanced settlement, one needs to generate and harvest adequate amount of energy. One thing that we already are using and definitely will use on another planet is photovoltaic solar panels. But of course, the technology does need to improve further. Solar cells are made up of gallium arsenide, crystalline silicon, and other such semiconductor materials. A colony in moon can definitely benefit from the fact that the lunar soil contains plenty of silicon and it could manufacture such cells for use in solar energy conversion. Despite their reliability, solar cells have low efficiency. As a result, they must be combined into large arrays to generate adequate power for practical applications. In addition, nuclear power can be used as well. Intact chambers build at a distance can store nuclear reactors and conduct small fissions or radioactive decays in order to produce electricity. Turbines can also be used to generate electricity by creating a closed loop of running water. Another innovative path to follow would be to place giant solar panels on satellites which would convert sunlight into microwaves which further would be beamed to antennas for reconversion into utilizable power. To produce adequate amount of power through this procedure, antennas of large diameters would be needed and must be partially assembled here on Earth. Then, these assemblies can be taken to the destination planet in order to build it up efficiently. Being a provider of limitless solar energy, it has no byproduct waste and can prove to be revolutionary. Also, as time passes and such space colonies become more efficient and stable, if the host planet contains a molten core, geothermal energy can prove to be a major source of power supply.\n\nThe human aspect of such missions are equally important for the sake of the mission as well as our race as it would be a criminal negligence if we ignore to consider the psychological effects the first settlers might face while executing such a big task. 6) In one of the \u2018Skylab\u2019 missions, the crew stopped working as they had too much workload. They did not work at all, for a whole day; a single day on Skylab was worth about $22.4 million as per current valuation. Possible contributing factors to this mutiny are said to be:\n\nRecently, an experiment was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia where six men underwent screening and spent 520 days in a small habitat. Four of them were found to have extensive problems with lethargy, insomnia, and productivity attributed to their tight confinement. Thus, one must also take into account the fact that the environment of the spaceship during the journey and of the settlement must be spacious and planned enough so that the settlers must not face any kind of trauma or depression.\n\nOne of the biggest achievements towards this venture would be to cancel out the human factor. If robots, controlled by earth based ground team, are able to build the settlement then the risk factor zeroes down to none during the initial phases. Intensive research and advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics can help us to supervise and remotely maneuver all the construction of such facilities. Machinery made of lighter metals would also make job of carrying them easier. TO get around such difficulties, all the fields of science and engineering must work together as the approach towards space colonization is not just to curb our fantasies. Moving further out in the solar system would be beneficial for us as the sun will, one day, engulf the Earth.\n\nAnd what if an asteroid, as massive as the one which made the dinosaurs go extinct, strikes our planet? What will happen when we consume the very last nibble of the last non-renewable resource? Thus, we have a lot of reasons to work together and find solutions to each and every problem that comes in this path. This would give all of the humanity a purpose to work together towards rather than fighting each other. Indeed a gargantuan project, but as human beings, we have come a long way since our ancestors migrated for the very first time from Africa, and we definitely have a long way to go. As Jim Green, director of the NASA Planetary Science Division, correctly said- \u201cI truly believe that a single planet species will not survive long. It is our destiny to move off this planet.\u201d\n\n2) The Hindu; How much water does an urban citizen need? By S.

        "text": "Not one to hide this opinion: I am a huge fan of remote work! I\u2019m very vocal about my belief that this trend towards more distributed workplaces has no choice but to continue. However I\u2019m not naive enough to say that working remotely is perfect, it adds a whole new set of complications to your work day that you need to be prepared to handle.\n\nWhen your on the road either in your home city or one across the world it can be a challenge to:\n\nThis is why I wanted to share what I typically keep in my bag. It should help keep you from learning the hard way, like I did.\n\nFirst: the items I use almost everyday, the Heavy Hitters.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that an article titled \u201cWhat\u2019s in my bag\u201d has a blurb about the bag itself, so lets just get this out of the way.\n\nYou move around a lot when you\u2019re remote: between places, between cafes, between traffic and more often than not from some where with shit wifi to slightly less shit wifi. So it\u2019s important that you have a bag that is:\n\nFor this I went with Timbuk2\u2019s Showdown. Super happy with this bag, nothing more to say on it though, it fit the bill.\n\nI\u2019ve got a Macbook Pro 13' (early 2015) and I\u2019m still in love \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nI\u2019ve never been secretive about my love for a bash terminal and an ecosystem that just works, nor for my dislike of the latest line of Macbook Pro\u2019s (wheres that 32GB Apple?). With that in mind I believe that the early 2015 may be one of the greatest laptops ever made and I\u2019m not alone in that feeling. Outside of technical specs it particularly shines when travelling since the mag-safe adapter means:\n\nGrab one while you still can.\n\nTrying to keep a team happy, a project on track, and code going out the door can often feel like a juggling act. Then you add in the logistics of remote work and it becomes a circus. This is why I write lists, lots of lists.\n\nThe simple act of writing out my list for the day, crossing items off and rearranging it for tomorrow using a pen with an old fashioned piece of paper is a great way to focus your mind on the task at hand. Lists also function as great book ends for your working day; allowing you to separate work from play.\n\nOften people try to keep these in various To-Do apps; for whatever reason though I\u2019ve been incapable of forming this habit, at least when its through a screen. So for this I typically will use an old fashion pen and paper to keep track of my life. Which is great because it\u2019s something I don\u2019t have to charge.\n\nI\u2019m also a big believer of investing in the tools you use often this is why my notebook and pen are little pricier than what you find at the dollar store. I find it makes my writing work with my thought rather than against it but to each their own!\n\nIt\u2019s simple: reading lots is great! Lugging around lots to read, not so great! Before you embark anywhere do yourself a favour and grab a Kindle, it will change your commute no matter how long.\n\nSpecial thanks to Michelle for the awesome present!\n\nThese are the thing\u2019s I keep around with the sole intention of staying charged, connected and ready if something unexpected should happen.\n\nEvery country is unique, unfortunately so are their power adapters. The trick here is to pack one that handles the largest number of outlets in the smallest size. I use this one and have been happy so far (though the ground\u2026.doesn\u2019t actually seem like it works so YMMV).\n\nWhen remote you are often tethered to your phone, and when you\u2019re not tethered you\u2019re navigating and when you\u2019re not navigating you\u2019re either on a call, desperately trying to translate, taking pictures or looking up your flight confirmation. All of this is draining, battery and otherwise, the last thing you need is a dead battery complicating your next meeting or getting to your hotel. Keep a battery pack handy to avoid this headache, trust me.\n\nKeep one with you on the road. I use a 1TB Seagate slim SSD, again no complaints here, pretty standard.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned that you should invest in the items you use often, I\u2019ve also mentioned you\u2019ll spend a lot of time charging your phone! Put the two together and you get a high quality phone cable.\n\nThese\u2019ll help you handle the things life throws at you.\n\nWet bike seats, Gym showers, Hot weather, weather in general and unexpectedly long layovers. Keeping a towel handy is good advice but hard to follow with your traditional piece of cloth. Pick up a travel towel that packs light and dries quick.\n\nThis is my favourite trick when working from a different time zone! Often you need to have overlap with your team, no matter if that means getting up at 4am local time. Keep a watch on you set to 9am for whenever your work day needs to start, regardless of what the current time actually is. It will save you the pain of having to wake up to the numbers 300 and trick your brain into getting onto the schedule you need. Bonus tips for keeping it water proof and cheap to save yourself from rogue waves or thieves. The Casio I use is perfect for this.\n\nGrab a small multi-tool for your bag, its size to problem solving ratio is in your favour. I have the Gerber Dime but I\u2019ve also used Leatherman\u2019s Juice in the past and been happy!\n\nYou can\u2019t get good work done if you\u2019re uncomfortable, travel is uncomfortable.\n\nDid I mention tethering? In most countries data is cheap but sometimes caps are low if you\u2019re tethering all the time. Keep an extra sim handy in case one gives out on you. Be wary of sim card merchants though, many will try and give you a down graded version of what you paid for, 3G when you asked for 4G, 1GB when you asked for 3.\n\nI\u2019m prone to loosing things, travel increases the number of opportunities I have to do just this. I try to keep an extra set around because in a noisy coffee shop a meeting is impossible without your headphones.\n\nGood for if I forget my main notebook or it runs out of space.\n\nOk this is the real secret! I\u2019ve been blessed to have grown up in a first world country; there\u2019s a good chance if you\u2019re reading this you have too. However outside of it you\u2019re far likelier to encounter someone looking to rip you off, muggings, bribes or otherwise.\n\nBecause of this I\u2019ll often keep an extra wallet handy with a bit of petty cash, an empty prepaid credit card and a driver license. If I get into a bad situation I can typically use this to get out of loosing everything to someone looking to rip me off. This typically pays off on most extended stays.\n\nIf I have any parting words it would be:"

        "title": "Do These 2 Things To Make Your Company Better and More Productive",
        "text": "Do These 2 Things To Make Your Company Better and More Productive\n\nWhen Jack Walsh took over as CEO of GE, he surprised shareholders and industry analysts by announcing that before the end of his tenure the flagging industrial giant would climb back from near bankruptcy and become \u21161 or \u21162 in every market it was in. At the time, Walsh\u0092s claim was considered arrogant. But within 10 years he had done just what he said he would do.\n\nTo achieve this spectacular business feat, Walsh did all the right things:\n\n* He created an exciting vision, one that his workers and associates could be proud of.\n\n* He communicated his vision so well that it became a corporate mantra.\n\n* He broke down inter-company communication boundaries to increase the flow of ideas. He also did a couple of things you don\u0092t hear about too often \u0096 one that I\u0092m trying to do right now and another that I\u0092m thinking I ought to do.\n\nThere is no more popular business buzz word today than \u0093relationship building.\u0094 The \u0093new\u0094 idea is that businesses fare better if they treat their customers like valued relations rather than financial targets.\n\nRelationship building is a long-term, customer-first approach to marketing, fulfillment, and service.\n\nIt requires a very intimate understanding of the customers\u0092 needs, wants, and beliefs \u0096 and seeks to know them from personal interaction with customers rather than through mass surveys or selective focus groups. Happily, personal interaction is exactly what the Internet is all about.\n\nBy establishing an interactive website, you have a cost-efficient place in which to engage your customers on a one-on-one basis. You will hear their complaints immediately . . . you will be able to observe their frustrations firsthand . . . and you will be able to gauge the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of the way you are handling them.\n\nWhen you want their feedback on a new product idea or an angle for a marketing campaign, they will be available to give it to you instantly.\n\nTo make an interactive website work for you, you\u0092ll need to make it work for your customers. And that means you need to make it worth their while to use it by luring them with additional (usually free) enticements. You should (almost) never give away anything that you intend to sell, but you can offer related products/services.\n\nI am right now urging a client to set up such a system. It is a club with more than 50,000 worldwide members \u0096 and the Internet is the perfect place to put those members in touch with the club and with one another.\n\nIt\u0092\u2019s obvious that a well-thought-out website will (a) be very beneficial to club members and (b) be enormously useful in soliciting new ideas for products and services members are in need of.\n\nMake your website more useful to your customers and I bet you\u0092ll start getting a lot of very good ideas directly from them. Jack Walsh made it easier for his customers to communicate with him (without the help of a website) and it made a big difference. Some of the ideas he got from them were worth millions.\n\nThe other unexpected thing Jack Walsh did (a \u0093Eureka!\u0094 moment for me) was to introduce \u0093quickness\u0094 as a corporate-wide business goal. He told GE\u0092s employees, \u0093We want to do everything we do quicker than we do it now. And if you help us, we will reward you.\u0094\n\nIt was a brilliant idea. Usually, managers try to manipulate their workers into working harder, longer, and faster. Jack Walsh simply asked them to do it. But he made his request a welcome challenge by establishing it as a company goal. I don\u0092t know if I\u0092\u2019m communicating to you how clever this really was.\n\nThe way I imagine it, doing almost anything faster became a challenge in every department and division of GE. And those who were successful in doing things faster were rewarded and encouraged to do more. The result was reported to be (and must have been) a great increase in efficiency and productivity.\n\nNew protocols were established, and cumbersome and outdated practices were eliminated. Instead of finagling your people into moving more quickly, simply ask them to.\n\nThey, not you, know where the productivity gaps are. Give them a chance to breach those gaps (and a reward for doing so) and your business will prosper. I\u0092\u2019m eager to try this out. How about you?"

        "text": "\u2026 the wealthier you are, the less empathetic you become.\n\nSaying that wealth grants a lot power in today\u2019s capitalistic societies is no great insight. Wealth is what makes you beautiful, what reduces your stress and daily fatigue, what grants you social prestige and education, what gives you time and freedom of choice. Wealth is a big deal.\n\nBut does wealth affect your behaviour? In other words, do emotional responses and rational thinking change when income increases? A team of scientists from UC Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Personality and Social Research did a serie of fascinating experiments on this topic.\n\nThey first tried to measure if individuals feel more important than others when put in a position of power.\n\nDifferent groups of three people were brought into a lab. In each group, one person was randomly assigned to be the \u201cleader\u201d. The groups were then given a collaborative writing task. About half an hour into their work, a plate with four cookies was brought: one for each person and one extra.\n\nWho took the fourth extra cookie? In almost all cases it was the person who\u2019d been made the leader. And they were more likely to eat with their mouths open and dropping crumbs. It just seems that, when put in a position of power, we tend to be more impulsive and less empathetic.\n\nThis pattern of increased selfishness has been consistently observed across similar studies.\n\nThe goal here is to check if there\u2019s a difference in driving behavior between the rich and the poor.\n\nThe researchers sat at specific crossroads, observing each driver\u2019s attitude as an accomplice appeared on the edge of the curb while cars approached. The results were astonishing: people driving luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedes yielded to pedestrians twice as less as drivers of less expensive cars.\n\nThey also watched a 4-way stop intersection, noting when drivers cut in front of others when it was not their turn. The results? The more expensive cars were far more likely to jump their turn.\n\nThis experiment\u2019s objective is to assess wether level of empathy is affected by how powerful the subject considers himself.\n\nSubjects sat down in a face-to-face conversation with people who talked about experiences that had caused them suffering. The listeners\u2019 responses were measured 2 ways: first by self-reported levels of compassion and second by electrocardiogram readings to determine the intensity of their emotional response.\n\nThe participants were also asked to rank themselves on questions measuring personal strengths (\u201cI can get people to listen to what I say\u201d) and weaknesses (\u201cMy wishes do not carry much weight\u2019\u2019). That allowed the researchers to place them on a \u201csense of power\u201d scale.\n\nThe findings were hugely insightful: participants with a higher sense of power were far more likely to turn a blind eye their partner\u2019s story. More precisely, they \u201cexperienced less distress, less compassion and exhibited greater autonomic emotion regulation\u201d.\n\nThis last study further confirms previous conclusions.\n\nParticipants were shown images of suffering \u2014 kids with cancer, for instance. People with a greater sense of power had less activation of a part of the brain that helps us connect to one another. To put it bluntly, they just seem less sensitive to what others are feeling.\n\nUltimately, it turns out wealth is a very good predictor for unethical behavior and reduced empathy. So what\u2019s happening here? Do you magically become ungrateful & greedy when you buy a new Porsche? What are the psychological mechanisms at play?\n\n\u2026 the richer you are, the more entitled you feel.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, the wealthy don\u2019t seem to fully recognise their good fortune. If they did, the level of redistribution would be far greater than what it is and tax cuts wouldn\u2019t be so popular among high income brackets.\n\nIt also seems that rich and poor largely disagree on factors that lead to success: according to a survey by the Pew Research Center, people with high income are much more likely to attribute success to hard work rather than to factors like luck or being in the right place at the right time.\n\nThat\u2019s troubling, because we saw earlier that socio-economic background is the main predictor of an adult\u2019s income and that social mobility is the exception, not the norm.\n\nMost behavioral and social scientists know that our brains are fundamentally flawed and that our opinions are not as rational as we might think. Human cognition gives us great insights to why wealthy people tend to underestimate the role of luck in their careers.\n\nThis term describes our tendency to rationalise unpredictable events. Humans have a natural inclination, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it.\n\nPhysicians recalling clinical trials, historians describing outcomes of battles, judges trying to attribute responsibility of accidents: examples are numerous.\n\nThis bias operates with particular force for unusually successful outcomes. People don\u2019t like to hear success explained away as luck \u2014 especially successful people. As they age and succeed, people feel their success was somehow inevitable.\n\nWhen making decisions or assessing situations, we tend to give a lot of importance to events we immediately recall; thus minimising the role of thing we forgot or never thought about. Under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent and concrete information. One practical example is that opinions are biased toward the latest news.\n\nA successful career is a subtle combination of multiple factors such as talent, capacity of concentration, amount of work, random encounters, family background, mental resilience, living environment, etc. The thing is, some of those factors are more frequent and easier to perceive than others.\n\nWe\u2019re all vividly aware of how many hours we spend working every day and how dedicated (or not) we are. We can effortlessly recall the last time we pulled an all-nighter to deliver on time and how difficult this hugely-important-but-really-complicated project was. But do you perceive how lucky you are not to have been born in Mozambique? How privileged you are to have a college degree? How improbable was your encounter with your business partner? How blessed you are to be healthy and without handicap?\n\nIn the construct of our life stories, we unconsciously shrink crucial but abstract factors. Unknowingly, we use mental shortcuts that minor the importance of everything that\u2019s not linked to our close environment. That\u2019s why we tend to largely overestimate the impact we, as individuals, have on our life paths.\n\nIn an existence led by randomness, humans tend to overemphasise their personal performance because they\u2019re biased towards their own day-to-day experience.\n\nA well known cognitive bias is that we recall negative events more frequently and more intensely than positive ones. For example, it\u2019s been proven that we\u2019re usually more upset about losing $50 than we are happy about gaining $50. The same applies to negative feedback, delayed flights, lost games, etc. The effect of those negative experiences is much more powerful than their positive counterparts.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective this is justified: survival requires urgent attention to possible bad outcomes (and less urgent to good ones). But in today\u2019s world, it\u2019s a major flaw in our decision-making capabilities. Looking back at our life-choices, we\u2019ll always be more aware of the hurdles and obstacles we faced than of the things that helped us. Think of it as cognitive ungratefulness."

        "text": "Trigger event selling allows you to get to your prospect at a point where they are most receptive to your solution, before they find your competition. It is the perfect opportunity to provide a solution when there is an actual need. This article takes you through what trigger event selling is, how it works, and what triggers to keep an eye out for.\n\nAs any salesperson or marketer knows, the key to any kind of selling is timing \u2014 the right person, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nUnfortunately that leaves a lot to chance. How many times have you heard \u201cNow just isn\u2019t a good time for us\u201d? You can have perfect data, a fantastic offering, engaging messaging and still nothing to show for your efforts because no one recognises the need for your service or products.\n\nTrigger event selling is about finding that need \u2014 approaching a prospect at a time when the conditions are right and there is a demand for the solution that you provide. In this article I am going to break down how and why you should leverage trigger events as a sales strategy, and how to monitor for trigger events you can leveragel.\n\n**Before we get into the what and the how, just a quick reminder that if you do want to monitor for trigger events but don\u2019t have the capacity in-house, Taskeater can help you flag up opportunities to pursue across your social media channels. Contact Us Here**\n\nA trigger event is anything that creates an opening for a marketing or sales opportunity. A shift or change in circumstances \u2014 either for a company as a whole or for an individual \u2014 that might make mean more favourable conditions for your offer.\n\nA couple of examples would be:\n\nAll of the above could lead to your contact or prospect looking to use your services \u2014 the conditions become more favourable for new business and/or competition.\n\nCraig Elias, the founding father of Trigger Event Selling and author of Shift!: Harness The Trigger Events That Turn Prospects Into Customers, describes this more clearly in relation to the buyer\u2019s journey, which he breaks into three different buyer modes.\n\nMost buyers are in a mode of \u2018Status Quo\u2019. They aren\u2019t shopping around for alternatives despite not being totally happy with the service, preferring to stick to what they know and what they already have in place. This is frequently the case with B2B service arrangements \u2014 finding an alternative takes research and effort, and ending an ongoing relationship is awkward. Often, the problem is not obvious or painful enough to trigger change independently.\n\nHowever, when that buyer feels a pain with their product/service due to a shift in circumstances, they enter a more active mode of \u2018Searching for Alternatives\u2019. They will begin actively looking for solutions themselves \u2014 often approaching a number of companies. This is where one of the limitations of Inbound becomes obvious. The prospect will be looking at multiple options and your webpage/offering might not make the cut. Research by the Aberdeen Group says the odds of making a sale in this phase are about 16% \u2014 or one out of every six or seven.\n\nAs Elias points out, there are two main barriers to making a sale in the modern marketplace:\n\nBetween \u2018Status Quo\u2019 and \u2018Searching For Alternatives\u2019 however, there is a critical stage where your prospect is aware of a problem but hasn\u2019t yet begun to search for solutions. Elias describes this as the \u2018Window of Dissatisfaction\u2019.\n\nThis is where trigger events come in. You can determine when a prospect enters the \u2018Window of Dissatisfaction\u2019 mode by monitoring different social media channels and news outlets for changes in circumstances that might lead to this shift. I\u2019ll explain how further down.\n\nThe fundamental premise Shift! Is built around the fact that the first to the scene, more often than not, gets the deal. As you can see from the image above from their official site, their mantra is \u201cFirst in wins 5X more often\u201d.\n\nThis is backed up by Forrester Research \u2014 reaching out to appropriately motivated decision makers before your competition does increase your odds of making the sale up to 74%.\n\nThe caveat here is it has to be BEFORE.\n\nIt is critical that you act fast. Once you have located a prospect with a relevant trigger point you have to leverage that immediately. You\u2019ll notice in the Shift! illustration of the modes that the time between entering the \u2018Window of Dissatisfaction\u2019 and beginning to \u2018Search for Solutions\u2019, is just 5 days. You need to action any trigger-based approach as soon as possible \u2014 before someone else does.\n\nThis is something Taskeater helps our clients with \u2014 monitoring all major social channels to inform clients as and when a trigger event is found. Contact us here.\n\nTrigger event selling enables you to customise your message to your prospect\u2019s exact pain points. You are the timely solution to their biggest problem. That means cold outreach strategies like cold calling and cold emailing can be personalised and targeted directly to a company or account.\n\nTrigger events can also help qualify and improve your prospecting list \u2014 especially for cold callers where the recipient is seldom thrilled about being contacted (if you are struggling with outbound strategy then download our ebook: Why Emails Deliver 11X More Meetings Than Calls). Identifying a need can help determine which leads to spend more time on.\n\nWith knowledge of a trigger event, your approach can become problem-focused, as opposed to solution-focused. Instead of opening with \u201cLet me tell you a little about my company and product\u201d, you can try \u201cI saw on LinkedIn that you recently received new funding. Congratulations! How can I help you invest in growth?\u201d Because they are personal and timely, triggers help to create a feeling of a personal connection, making you seem more human and keeping your prospect engaged.\n\nMonitoring for trigger events is a difficult job and takes time. It is rare that you\u2019ll stumble across a tweet or LinkedIn post on your newsfeed announcing \u201cI need a new [product/service] \u2014 can anyone help me out?\u201d\n\nBy monitoring and tracking trigger events through a variety of channels, you will be able to capture both the blatant and subtle shifts that can help warm up your cold outreach approach.\n\nWe have collected just a few of the ways that you can monitor for these shifts \u2014 but if you need any help with the process this is a service you can outsource. We have helped hundreds of companies globally prospect and scale through a combination of automation and dedicated offshore team. Get in touch here.\n\nA key first step is taking the time to work out which trigger events are useful for your company. According to Elias, trigger events fall into 3 key categories:\n\nYou\u2019ll notice a lot of these bullets are repeated across various channels \u2014 that is intentional!\n\nWhen you are monitoring for trigger events it is very possible something will slip through the cracks (not if you hire a Taskeater team though ;) ) so it is critical that you spread yourself over several channels. The ol\u2019 double alarm clock trick.\n\nGoogle Alerts allows you to keep up to date with the latest press releases, company news, management changes and projects. You set the keywords and receive news clippings in a round-up email, which you can then base the timing and messaging of your campaign around. This is particularly useful for anything Account-Based (although if it is that specific \u2014 ensure you frequently check their company news and press releases as well).\n\nLinkedIn posts and updates pair well with Google Alerts \u2014 especially within an account-based strategy where your target is clear. However it also allows you to keep up to date with individual contacts or key target prospects, which can make your outreach messaging more targeted and personal to their specific experience/problems.\n\nI have actually written a whole separate article on how CRM cleansing can facilitate trigger event selling \u2014 Trigger Event Selling: How To Generate New Business With CRM Cleansing. I would read that for more detail, but in summary, CRM cleansing can flag up when a contact has moved on or is promoted, which then enables you to reach out to them at their new place of work or team.\n\nSocial Media Monitoring, which is something Taskeater provides for our clients, is especially powerful because it allows you to monitor for interest in areas relevant to your business. You can monitor for specific trigger events at scale and engage prospects directly from that platform.\n\nMonitoring channels more broadly for things like negative experiences with your competitors, interest in relevant topic areas, or even asking for insight into an issue directly is a hard job to handle for a small team or startup, and expensive to run in-house. However, it is one of the most useful and bountiful trigger events to monitor, and is scalable across your target segments (as opposed to focused on a single account).\n\nTaskeater works with over 200 companies worldwide to help streamline processes and increase internal efficiency by supporting your existing workflows. Outsource time-consuming tasks such as social media content monitoring to us and your team only has to deal with opportunities, not the leg work.\n\nGet in touch with one of our London team here to find out more about how we can help monitor social media for key trigger events you can use to leverage in your sales strategy."

Apple was lost in a confusing product portfolio with dozens of models and was 90 days away from bankruptcy. Steve Jobs reduced the 15 desktop models to exactly two, the iMac for consumers and the Power Macintosh G3 for professionals. He did the same for the mobile devices with the iBook and the PowerBook G3, leaving exactly four products focused on the respective customer groups and a slimmed-down organization. A very painful process that enabled Apple to survive (already in 1998 Apple was back in the black after just over a billion dollars in losses in 1997) and ultimately marked the beginning of its rise to become the most valuable company in the world.\n\nChoosing between a bad idea and a good idea is not hard. It is much more difficult to choose between many more or less equally good or incomparable ideas. Focusing means saying no much more often than saying yes and consciously accepting the opportunity cost that come with every no. At the individual level, this is called FOMO (fear of missing out) and is massively reinforced by social media.\n\nAs Apple\u2019s example clearly shows, however, the FOMO mechanism also and especially works at the organizational level. There it is stated more elegantly: \u201cDo one without letting the other.\u201d But the result is the same as at the level of the individual: dancing at too many weddings, starting too much without having completed anything else first. What this leads to and why work-in-progress must also and especially be limited at higher levels in the organization is shown by Klaus Leopold in the following interesting talk. It shows that agility at team level is suboptimal if the teams nevertheless work on too many projects. Despite all the agility at team level, such an organization remains sluggish because it lacks the focus on the essential projects at the higher level of the organization. That is why I consider focusing to be one of the most important leadership tasks today: Stop starting, start finishing!"

        "text": "A common goal can be anything from starting a new department, launching a new product or expanding into new markets.\n\nHaving said that, motivating your team to achieve that common goal is way more than just putting on the same jerseys.\n\nA team motivated towards that common goal will bounce off the walls. Not only it\u2019ll get job satisfaction, it\u2019ll also turn focused, productive and disciplined.\n\nWhen teams aren\u2019t motivated enough to achieve that common goal, however, there are consequences. From things going above the allocated budget to turning things in at the eleventh hour, anything can happen.\n\nHere, I will give you the roadmap to motivate and inspire your teams to achieve that common goal without even moving the goalposts.\n\nEvery single day, I jump out of the bed with a chase to turn ProofHub a better product than it is. That is my motivation.\n\nGiving the team something to look forward to a few days before setting clear goals will cultivate a sense of anticipation and interest in them.\n\nNot only this will create a comfortable space as they\u2019ll be getting familiar to the prospective goal, this will also encourage them to encounter opportunities to grow as an individual as well as a part of the organization.\n\n2. The clearer the goals, the more likely they are achieved\n\nBeginning with the end in mind makes it easier to understand the expectations.\n\nHere, we ensure the team identifies and agrees with the goals and deadlines you have set. If teams are in agreement with the same, they certainly feel more involved in their work.\n\nMaking sure of this will not only motivate them to work hard, but also boost them to raise their bars of productivity.\n\n3. Your team will buy into a leader before they buy into a goal\n\nJust like Alexander the Great leading his men into battle, leaders need to roll up their sleeves to inspire greatness too.\n\nSimply put, a team cannot win the game if their leader isn\u2019t willing to play. A great leader walks his talk so that other people are willing to follow him.\n\nTaking responsibility turns leaders credible. Teams start putting their confidence in the leader and their abilities, which in turn keeps the team going.\n\n4. Only if you welcome ideas, you\u2019ll have a team that has something to say\n\nFrom suggestion boxes to emails and meetings, let them know you welcome ideas at any time.\n\nSeek to understand in a tone that encourages healthy dialogue. This way the team will be encouraged to share their ideas in the first flush of enthusiasm.\n\nYou never know when the goal will become so common that you\u2019re discussing it even during hallway conversations. No leader wants the good ideas to end up on the back burner where they may be buried and forgotten, do you?\n\n5. Every day may not be good, but there\u2019s good in every day\n\nGood vibes mean you still have a chance. Not dwelling on problems and instead be the first to offer solutions will only lead to a team that is bringing in more value.\n\nHurdles and obstacles shall not define your goal, team or even organization, after all.\n\nIt\u2019s very powerful when a leader genuinely shares a time when they cut their own throat and how it became a stepping stone in their career. I am sure we\u2019ve all been on failed projects and ultimately turned them into something constructive.\n\n6. Keeping together is progress, working together is success\n\nWe rise by lifting others. When a team roots for each other they\u2019ll certainly be motivated to see each other grow too.\n\nLeaders encourage teams to not only work on themselves but also on each other. Sharing their skill-set or learnings among each other will only boost their morale.\n\nThe opportunity to get to know each other better helps in creating an environment where everyone feels they have an investment in a common goal.\n\n7. Teams will always go the extra mile for praise and recognition\n\nAcknowledge the efforts. Once a leader recognizes team\u2019s achievements and contribution towards the common goal, it is he who reaps the rewards.\n\nFrom increasing team\u2019s loyalty to enhancing performance and achieve that goal, recognition is priceless and holds status much more than money.\n\nWhen you praise one person in front of others, it will only encourage them to work harder towards the goal.\n\nThe good news is that the ship hasn\u2019t sailed yet.

        "title": "10 things I\u2019ve learned in my first year of startup life",
        "text": "10 things I\u2019ve learned in my first year of startup life\n\nI graduated from university with one goal in mind: I didn\u2019t want to work for a large company.\n\nCorporations come with too much red tape. I wanted to work in an entrepreneurial, fast-moving and challenging environment.\n\nSo, as a writer, I opted for a content marketing startup.\n\nThe agency I work for are in the top seven percent of the fastest growing startups in the UK. We\u2019re a platinum certified HubSpot partner and an ever-growing community of friendly, geeky writers and marketers.\n\nBut it took me six months to find this remote-working job. I declined a job at Universal Music straight out of University because I didn\u2019t want an office job, and I\u2019ve never looked back.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in the year I\u2019ve been at a startup.\n\nObvious, right? What I mean by this, however, may not necessarily be what you think. The definition of how to do a job at a startup is forever changing. You forge your own path. Big business comes with structure and process already in place. Startups do not.\n\nI work directly under my boss. My boss is the CEO. I\u2019m in on sales calls, I\u2019m in on quarterly strategy calls, website development calls, content planning calls and review calls.\n\nI learn about what it takes to own and run a business every day.\n\nThe client isn\u2019t always right. Just because you\u2019re a small business it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re there to \u2018serve\u2019 those around you. You have the power to say no to work, to turn down client requests and decline to work harder than necessary.\n\nOn the contrary, you need to put in the hours where it counts, and much of that means working beyond the nine to five. I assume this is similar for those high up at big businesses. It seems to go full circle. You work hard when you\u2019re a startup, cruise through the middle ground of working a mid-level role and then work hard again as you start taking control of the steering wheel. That middle ground is limbo. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s complacent. Don\u2019t settle in that grey area.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned from my time in marketing, it\u2019s that word-of-mouth is essential to growth. But how are those who\u2019ve been recommended your business supposed to validate you?\n\nYour website, then, is everything. Testimonials, great content and case studies validate your startup. It\u2019s about becoming a trusted thought leader. Nothing more.\n\nBecause boundaries are constantly being defined in startups, you have the opportunity to lead your company in a certain direction. Sure, it involves constant R&D, but if you love process enough and can bring a new service to fruition, and consequently sell it to your clients, you\u2019re doing something right.\n\nStartups know very little. Fact. They\u2019re not specialists, they\u2019re not defined, they\u2019re not settled into their niche. Your opportunity to define that path, then, is massive.\n\nSpend most of your time developing strategy. Learn new insights, tools, techniques and focus on efficiency and process. Then teach the rest of your company your findings.\n\nThe above, however, requires a certain mindset. If you\u2019re employed by a startup, you yourself are an entrepreneur. You\u2019ve been hired to think freely and act freely. Don\u2019t wait to be instructed. Make work for yourself.\n\nFinally, work/life balance is essential. Startup culture either promotes all work/no play or it promotes a balanced working lifestyle. Adopt the latter to ensure you don\u2019t burn out."

        "text": "You ever known that guy who talks a big game but never does anything about it?\n\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about throwing fistacuffs or anything like that, I\u2019m talking about startup bros.\n\nThe ones who always have a million dollar idea and are on the verge of quitting their job to become a millionaire in the next 2 months\u2026\n\nBut then they spend every weekend slamming beers, puffing hippie lettuce, and \u201cresting up\u201d as they know their new journey is going to take a lot of work?\n\nBut that was me 3 years ago.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but brag about all the amazing business ideas I had, and to my credit, I did have a really good network that would help me out (I was a Commercial Loan Officer, so I worked with millionaires on a daily basis)\u2026\n\nBut deep down I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything about it.\n\nI was making way too much money, having way too much fun, and loved my co-workers way too much (serious talk, they were pretty much 90% of my friends)\u2026\n\nBut then one day the hammer dropped on me and I was fired from my job.\n\nWish I could say it was deserved, and things would\u2019ve been a lot easier if it was\u2026\n\nBut it happened and that sent me into a few months of serious depression.\n\nI decided to numb the pain with my boy Jack Daniels for the first few weeks, but it didn\u2019t take long to run out of money and within a month a getting fired\u2026\n\nI knew I had to finally pick myself up and try to find a job.\n\nFortunately my old co-workers had my back and within 3 days of reaching out to a few contacts, I had 7 interviews setup\u2026\n\nWhich gave me all the confidence I needed to move forward.\n\nI showed up to every interview with an overwhelming amount of arrogance, knowing I was a hidden gem that any bank would benefit from\u2026\n\nBut no matter what I did or how many interviews I showed up to, I couldn\u2019t land a job to save my life.\n\nThis caught me off guard as I\u2019d always been good at interviews and had over 50 professional references to vouch for me\u2026\n\nBut then in my last interview, the lady straight up told me that I looked good on paper \u2014 but in person, not so much.\n\nI can\u2019t remember exactly what she said, but it was something about how I clearly wasn\u2019t doing well\u2026\n\nAnd it\u2019s just hard to hire somebody in my position.\n\nAt the time I really didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, but I appreciated the fact that she confirmed my fears\u2026\n\nSo that night I went home and decided I was going to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams.\n\nI figured I didn\u2019t have much to lose, and nobody was going to hire me anyway\u2026\n\nSo after doing some \u201cresearch\u201d and thinking about it for a solid 2 hours, I created my first business \u2014 a bookkeeping firm.\n\nAfter working countless hours and having zero clients to show for it, I realized a change needed to happen asap\u2026\n\nBecause well, if it didn\u2019t \u2014 I was going to be sleeping on the streets.\n\nStuck and not sure what else to do, I decided to jump on Upwork and see if anybody on there could help me.\n\nAt the time I really didn\u2019t know what I needed, so I just posted something along the lines of \u201cChief Marketing Officer needed for growing accounting firm\u201d\u2026\n\nThen within a matter of 34 seconds, the applicants came flying in.\n\nI decided to give it at least an hour before looking through the applications, but then once that time passed\u2026\n\nI excitedly jumped on my laptop and started looking for my saving grace.\n\nNow you gotta remember, this was the brokest I\u2019d ever been in my life, so I was looking at price first and profile second.\n\nI think I spent a solid 47 seconds scrolling through the applicants before finally finding somebody in my price range\u2026\n\nThen once I did, I clicked on her profile and vividly remember thinking, \u201choly hell, you reek of desperation\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not even making this up to fit the story, I seriously remember thinking this\u2026\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t because they had a depressing profile picture or anything like that, it was because they had a headline of \u201cSocial Media Marketer/Graphic Designer/Copywriter/Bookkeeper\u201d \u2026\n\nWhich pretty much screamed, \u201cI just need money and I\u2019ll do anything\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd that\u2019s the exact impression I was giving off in my interviews, which is the same reason why nobody would hire me.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing to recognize, because you\u2019d think this desperation might at least provide some empathy and give you a \u201csympathy\u201d hire\u2026\n\nBut guess what, when people are spending money to get things done, they really don\u2019t want to hire somebody who\u2019s not operating at 100%\u2026\n\nAnd this is something I experienced first-hand, because even though I was broke and needed to hire somebody at a low price\u2026\n\nI knew it wasn\u2019t worth it, so I ended up going with a more expensive freelancer who specialized in what I was looking for (Facebook Ads).\n\nAnd I never really thought about this too much, until recently when I started writing blogs about freelancing and offered a free course to aspiring freelancers.\n\nDid this mainly so I could help them expedite the process, as I know how bad it sucks\u2026\n\nBut as time went on and my list continued to grow, I started to receive more and more messages revolving around the same 2 things\u2026\n\nTheir profile isn\u2019t getting approved, and for those who were getting approved \u2014 they couldn\u2019t land a client to save their life.\n\nThis was usually followed up with a call for help, so I\u2019d ask them to send over a link to their profile, that way I could take a look\u2026\n\nAnd I shit you not, every single time \u2014 they\u2019d fall into the same trap of thinking they needed to be in 5 different categories and offer 12 different skills.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not here to poke fun as I\u2019ve been through the depths of hell with freelancing\u2026\n\nAnd I really do want to help everybody avoid this mess, which is why I wanted to give you a few quick tips that\u2019ll do just that.\n\nWhat I mean by this is\u2026\n\nYou want to look like you\u2019re positioned for one skill, but do so in a way that can easily handle other jobs as well.\n\nTo give you an example of this, my main niche over the years was a \u201cSales Copywriter\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd even though I\u2019d only apply to jobs that were asking for copywriters\u2026\n\nOnce I was in with them and understood the project, that\u2019s when I\u2019d start offering my other services as well.\n\nThis was always something along the lines of Facebook Advertising, creating landing pages, designing sales pages, etc\u2026\n\nAll things that were directly related to sales copywriting and allowed me to make some extra money, but I never really advertised them up front\u2026\n\nAs that\u2019d just make me look like a desperate generalist.\n\nAnother way to utilize all your skills is to simply combine two interests and create your own niche.\n\nThere\u2019s about 6,289,187(ish) ways to do this\u2026\n\nBut to give you an example from my experience, one of my earliest niches was a copywriter for tax firms.\n\nI did this because I had my Master\u2019s in Accounting and was an IRS Enrolled Agent\u2026\n\nGiving me all the information I needed to write about tax, and as I\u2019m sure you can guess \u2014 I landed pretty much every tax writing job out there (the only ones I didn\u2019t were the ones who couldn\u2019t afford my rate).\n\nLast but not least, using your other skills as relationship enhancers.\n\nSo as I just mentioned, tax is my jam and something I\u2019m very familiar with\u2026\n\nBut not something I wanted to do as a primary service, so I never really told my clients about this\u2026\n\nUntil times when a tax issue/question would come up in conversation, and I\u2019d just start telling them what they should do.\n\nThis always caught them off guard at first, but then once they realized I kind of knew what I was talking about\u2026\n\nThey loved me even more, and even though I don\u2019t have direct metrics that I can provide for this\u2026\n\nIt always seemed like I got more work after I showed them how valuable I really was.\n\nTrust me, I\u2019m not saying having multiple skills is a bad thing.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer in understanding how everything works, that way you can connect the dots\u2026\n\nBut at the same time, you don\u2019t want to show this up front as it looks desperate \u2014 and there\u2019s really no way around it.\n\nSimply position yourself with one \u201csurface\u201d skill\u2026\n\nThen offer your other services after the relationship has started (and of course, only if it makes sense)."

        "title": "Create A Stand Out Customer Service Team With 6 Easy Steps",
        "text": "Your customers expect nothing but the best. In a time where it\u2019s super easy for customers to do business elsewhere, you have to make sure that you are consistently providing excellent customer service. Most companies would rather spend money acquiring new customers than retaining old ones. But, did you know that acquiring new customers can cost 7X more than retaining one? If you\u2019re in a startup or a small business, retaining customers is so much easier especially in the beginning.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big catch here \u2014 most startups already know how to provide good customer service. How can you let people know that your service is better? How can you retain your existing customers effectively? I have 6 ways here that can help your customer service team stand out.\n\nYour customers will likely be fairly small as compared to a Fortune 500 company, this simply means that you are at an advantage. You have the capability to personalize each touch points. Proactively reach out to your customers and make an effort to know some of them by name and face. This will make your customers feel valued and appreciated.\n\nEach customer brings their own set of unique needs. Some may be harder than the others but, you still have to make an effort and deliver. Repeat customers and referrals are your lifeblood in the early stages. You don\u2019t want to turn away anyone by providing inconsistent customer service.\n\nNo matter who the customer is, whether they\u2019re new or existing make sure that you treat them the same. Not just in the customer service, this kind of attitude should be present all across.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you respond accordingly to your customers. This is not just about responding in a timely manner but, it\u2019s also about being able to respond appropriately. More often than not we are tied up to the idea of fast replies that we tend to lose focus on what\u2019s important, which is the quality of the response.\n\nYour objective shouldn\u2019t just to answer fast, it should be to answer as quick as you can with all the right information. Focus your energy in first contact resolutions because it makes all the difference in the customer experience.\n\nYou have to ensure that you have a feedback system in place. An organized way of collecting customer suggestions is the best way to improve. Encourage your customers to share their experience with you on social media. Feature customer feedbacks on your website and social media pages. Your customers will appreciate being listened to and they will feel part of the solution.\n\nFailure is bound to happen. If you\u2019re unprepared it\u2019ll be difficult to recover from it. Think of service failures as an opportunity. An opportunity to let your customers know how resilient you are in providing amazing customer service.\n\nA customer who experiences a service failure and got an excellent resolution may even come out of the situation as a loyal customer.\n\nThe best way to your customer\u2019s heart is through your employees. Whether it\u2019s a team of 3 people or 10 teams, you have to make sure that give your employees the appreciation they deserve. Applaud them for going the extra mile. Show appreciation by giving small tokens. Make them feel loved and cared for. A happy employee will naturally yield happy customers."

        "text": "The thing I like about startups is the diversity and complexity of the problems they face. Nobody can solve the puzzle from the outside, it does not matter how many years of experience he or she has.\n\nHere\u2019s the story. A very promising startup received funding from investors and reached out to me for collaboration. They had to grow aggressively to deliver promised results. The initial team included CTO(co-founder), two senior backend developers, two middle-level developers, frontend and backend, QA who also helped them with the design. They needed approximately 15 engineers and four designers within the shortest possible period. I was quite busy with other projects, but I regularly sent candidates, who were highly qualified. Overall, I sent 14 candidates, zero chosen. I was close to withdrawing from that project but chose to stay and understand what was the obstacle there.\n\nI asked their CEO to work from their office for two weeks, and he allowed. As a Hawthorne effect, their in-house team started to deliver exceptional results and provide referrals. I created a referral reward program and compensated them with Kindles. After two weeks I praised everybody for their friendly hospitality and advised CEO to eliminate CTO from the interviewing process.\n\nSince we had no results from the interviews, I sent candidates I had invited a Google Form including simple questions about the interviewing process. Questions were about the professionalism of the interviewer, the relevance of asked questions for the position, plus questions like whether they would consider our company as a workplace in the future. I got nine responses and seven of them gave negative feedback. Some comments mentioned that the interviewer was trying too hard to show his expertise and superiority. Another applicant wrote that he had been asked irrelevant questions related to his future plans of personal life. While discussing salary range, our beloved CTO gave comments like \u201cI won\u2019t give such rates for your knowledge\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t say you\u2019re a developer if you don\u2019t know that\u201d. Another response made it clear that questions were specifically constructed to trick candidates, but not to reveal their actual knowledge.\n\nI reached out to people who did not complete the questionnaire and asked to provide feedback by phone. They told me a lot of negative stuff similar to above mentioned. Now I had 13 responses and could not reach out to the last one, so I packed my bag and went straight to his workplace because that\u2019s how I work. After getting my 14th negative feedback, I began to look for a flexible solution, as I could not hire people without CTO\u2019s approval and he was the one who was blocking the process. During my two weeks, I noticed that he arrived at 11:30 AM, drank his latte and started to work from 12:00 PM. Obviously, I began scheduling interviews at 10:00 AM, so he did not think that we don\u2019t want him to participate. The CEO was very helpful. We additionally involved the other two senior developers we had and made some outstanding hires. We worried that the CTO might be against such hires, but he was surprisingly supportive. Candidates were leaving the building smiling, and I was sure that they will consider our proposal if we make one.\n\nAnother problem arose later when we were struggling to find qualified designers. We were offering all kinds of goodies/benefits , stuff that nearly everyone offers \u2014 a flexible work schedule, snacks, bonuses, a highly competitive salary.\n\nI created a small survey for my designer friends and based on the results changed our offer a bit. The initial proposal included 13th salary as a bonus, quarterly rewards based on the performance and gym membership. I eliminated the 13th salary, made some cuts from quarterly bonuses, (these creative fellows don\u2019t give a damn about money, believe me) and added a weekly trip (anytime after their sixth month in the company) to some exhibitions and art events in Barcelona. Regarding expenses, it was nearly identical, but it crashed the system. We had so many applicants that I was having a really hard time shortlisting the right ones.\n\nI felt like a substitute football player who scored the world cup winning goal at the 114th minute of the game. It was one of the most challenging projects I\u2019ve ever been in. They went on to reach more astonishing results with their strong team.\n\nP.S. I don\u2019t want to mention any names, but in case you\u2019re reading this still remember that brown cake you used to make (you know my address, nothing\u2019s changed)."

You can\u2019t focus on loosing weight and getting fit but go partying with your friends all weekend at the same time. You will just ruin all your hard weight-loss efforts during the week. The same is true for your work: You can\u2019t focus on everything at once. You need to decide what is important (see 1) and say \u201cno\u201d to (almost) everything else. If you need some guidance on how to say \u201cno\u201d: Marie Forleo\u2019s team wrote a wonderful guide on this.\n\nFocus has a lot to do with proactively choosing what to work on. Checking your email first thing in the morning or being stuck in back-to-back meetings for a few hours can seriously derail your focus for the day \u2014 leaving you busy but unproductive. Instead, start the day with intention by asking yourself: If I could only do ONE thing today to make progress on my goals, what would it be? Then, do it first thing in the morning. If that\u2019s not possible, block out deep work time during the day and stick to it. Furthermore, making it a rule to keep mornings for deep work and meetings/email for afternoons can have a tremendous impact on increasing your focus (if you are a morning person ;))."

        "text": "Who Can Benefit From Mentorship?\n\nBack in the early days of Cronofy, the team met up with a mentor (who was also one of our early investors) to define the company culture. One of the things he said is still quoted around the office today: \u201cCulture isn\u2019t foosball tables.\u201d There may have been some more colourful language included too\u2026\n\nI love a game of foosball as much as the next person, but I\u2019m inclined to agree with him.\n\nHowever, when you see places like Google or Facebook showing off their nap pods and games rooms and Starbucks and whatever other benefits they have, it can feel like that\u2019s what a company culture is all about.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s so, so much more than that.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the beauty of mentorship \u2014 it helps you to see things in a whole new way. You can avoid the mistakes that someone else has already made, which means you grow and progress faster. It also helps you to shake preconceived ideas (like that company culture is about employee benefits) while still giving you the freedom to make your own decisions.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it \u2014 mentorship is powerful.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how mentorship can benefit us at different stages of our careers and, more broadly, lives.\n\nWhen it comes to mentorships in education, there are two paths: peer-to-peer mentorship, and professionals mentoring students.\n\nPeer-to-peer mentorship schemes are where a student mentors someone on the same or a similar course a year or two below them. This allows them to share knowledge, improve their communication skills, and gives the mentor something great to put on their resume. Working as a mentor is also something that will help students to stand out in job applications and can prepare them for managerial roles in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to professionals mentoring students, colleges\u2019 and universities\u2019 career centers are a great way connect them. Counsellors can contact relevant businesses and connect them with interested students.\n\nProfessionals can prepare students for the working world by sharing their experiences of looking for jobs and building their network. They can also give them advice on how their courses will apply to their future job, or general advice on how to prepare for the transition into the working environment. Mentorships of this kind can even lead to internships and even job opportunities after graduation.\n\nProfessionals can also help students with the job search process, which most courses don\u2019t prepare them for. Career centers are great helps, but they have to factor in hundreds of industries. A mentor that works within the student\u2019s chosen industry has much more in-depth knowledge and potential connections that could benefit the student throughout their career.\n\nMentorship is one of the best ways for students to figure out what to do after university. Navigating the post-university landscape is tough, and having the right mentor can really help students to avoid getting lost in the labyrinth of the real world.\n\nEmployee mentorship schemes are one of the ways businesses can assist employees in their careers. They\u2019re particularly useful for new employees who need to get started fast, or for those who want to progress but aren\u2019t sure what to do next. Mentorship schemes can be used to train employees to become managers, or teach them how to become an expert in a particular area.\n\nNot everyone wants to manage people, so it\u2019s important that companies offer employees different ways to grow and process. Mentorship can help employees and businesses to work out a mutually beneficial path.\n\nMentorship is also a way to keep employees engaged and make them feel valued. It gives them a way for their voices to be heard, which, in a large organization, can be difficult.\n\nManagerial mentorship is one of the ways businesses can train their team members for career progression. It can build a prospective manager\u2019s confidence by teaching them to speak up and improving their interpersonal skills.\n\nFor the mentor, it develops their active listening skills while allowing them to give back to the company that may have helped to build their career. This improves their loyalty and decreases staff turnover.\n\nMentees also learn about the psychology of a team, from how to motivate them, to what makes them tick, to how to adapt behaviour based on different members of a team. For someone starting out, knowing how to behave around different team members is important to ensuring a happy and productive team.\n\nHaving a mentor can also help newer managers to troubleshoot, or ease the burden of the hiring process.\n\nEntrepreneurs can benefit from mentoring more than anyone else. Forming your own business is super lonely, and without a mentor, you may have nobody to rely on for advice. There are so many reasons that a startup can fail, meaning that mentorship is both valuable and vital to a startup\u2019s success.\n\nOur very own Adam Bird is mentoring an entrepreneur right now, showing him the ropes as he navigates setting up his first company.\n\nMentorship can help entrepreneurs figure out how to navigate the complicated world of business faster than if they were doing it alone. It also gives them someone with experience to discuss ideas and troubleshoot with. In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship, this can be the difference between a business\u2019s success and failure.\n\nMentors can also help up-and-coming entrepreneurs to decide how best to grow their company and what types of people they want to hire for their core team. The first few members of a company will dictate a company\u2019s culture moving forward, so picking the right people makes a huge difference.\n\nWhatever stage of your career you\u2019re at, a mentor can guide you through current and future situations. Their guidance can be invaluable, helping you to avoid the steep learning curves that often come from navigating new areas of your career. You can then learn more and progress faster thanks to their invaluable guidance.\n\nMentorship networks like PeopleGrove and Veterati are fantastic ways for mentees to meet up with mentors. They make it a simple, seamless process for them to connect with one another, allowing them both to feel the benefits of mentorship faster."

        "title": "How To Find Good App Developers \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "So, you have successfully become the founder of a tech startup company. Congrats!\n\nLet\u2019s see: you have probably managed to put together a concept for your idea, write it down, create a business plan, and might have even rented an office. All you need to do now is find someone who will bring your app idea to life. Who is it going to be though? A development company, new employees or a group of individual app developers working remotely? How are you supposed to decide?\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll most likely do is ask one of your friends for a recommendation. This is completely understandable \u2014 it is common for a founder to rely on a recommendation from family and friends. However, if you rely solely on your friends for a recommendation, you could end up making a huge mistake \u2014 and here\u2019s why.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know: when it comes to searching for developers, limiting yourself is the worst thing you can do. Simply asking around if anyone\u2019s available is just not good enough. You need a team of great app developers, who are not only devoted to your project, but also have enough experience and knowledge and, on top of that, are willing to work for a startup company.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don\u2019t limit your search, you are going to find yourself in a sea of developers, losing your mind over whom to choose. Nowadays, when there are so many of them out there it can be really hard to choose a couple just by looking at their portfolio. It is especially challenging if you don\u2019t have the necessary knowledge and a set of programming skills.\n\nI am here to help you out with that by providing you with a couple of options that don\u2019t include hiring someone a family member/a friend recommended. Before I begin, there is just one piece of advice I want to give you: if you are not a developer yourself, try finding a recruiter who has worked for a development company and knows exactly how to find the best ones. This will ease up the process of interviewing after finding developers.\n\nLet\u2019s get to how you can find those developers, shall we?\n\nThe first thing you have to decide, based on your experience is whether you want to hire actual employees, freelancer(s) or a whole development team.\n\nRecently, the most popular way of creating an app is to hire someone \u201cfrom the outside\u201d. Sure\u30fchaving teammates is a great option, but finding the right ones usually takes longer than hiring freelance app developers or a development company to help you out.\n\nSince I work for Kolosek, a remote development team, I am not going to advise you to hire one. There is no need for promotion. However, I have to mention one difference between a development team and a freelancer.\n\nSo, the main difference is the fact that with a team you get the \u201cwhole package\u201d. What does this mean? Well, when you hire a team, you actually hire a group of individuals that are used to working together and each of them is an expert in their own field. This is especially important since most development teams have app developers and designers. However, bear in mind that hiring a development team requires investing a lot more resources into it.\n\nOn the other hand, freelancers can seem like a good cup of Jacobs instant coffee \u201c3 in 1\u201d\u30fcfront-end, back-end developer and a designer in one person. I can\u2019t help but wonder how one person can be an expert in several fields. That being said, you should be aware there is always an option of hiring more than one freelancer.\n\nThe point is: choose the ones your entrepreneurial intuition think it\u2019s the best.\n\nFinal advice I can give you: before you decide whether to hire freelancers or a development team/company, be sure to check Clutch.co. This website will provide with a list of top web development companies, as well as top developers in using different technologies.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the actual searching for app developers.\n\nYes, location is the second factor you should bear in mind. Since I had such a strong opinion about hiring developers which were recommended to you, you probably think I am against searching for a developer locally, as well. This can\u2019t be farther from the truth. In that paragraph, I just wanted to highlight that you shouldn\u2019t hire developers solely based on a recommendation. The location had nothing to do with the choice.\n\nThe best and probably the easiest thing you can do is check for app developers locally. Ask around, but don\u2019t jump to conclusion too fast. Google them, do whatever it takes to find the right ones.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are over 12 million app developers in the world, why limit yourself? Knowing that the grass is always greener on the other side, why not go and check that grass out?\n\nIf you turn to Quora answers, you\u2019ll learn that you can find the best app developers in India, Ukraine, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Poland. So, which country to choose? Well, if you are on a budget, India is definitely an option since product development in that region is highly cost-effective.\n\nIf you take a moment to compare their prices to those on People Per Hour, for example, you\u2019ll see that PPH developers and designers request anywhere from $10-$35 per hour. In the USA, your average developers are twice as expensive as their counterparts in India \u2014 charging up to $70 per hour \u2014 so there\u2019s always that to keep in mind throughout your search.\n\nAccording to Appfutura.com, in an overall ranking, the first three countries in which you can find great app developers are China, Russia and Poland. I have to mention that developers from Central and Eastern Europe are definitely not far behind.\n\nThe point is this: don\u2019t settle for the first developer you find. Explore your options a bit before you hire one and you\u2019ll probably end up making the right decision.\n\nNow, if you decide to go with freelancers, you should know that there are multiples freelance websites where you can easily hire them.\n\nToptal, Upwork, Freelancer, and GetACoder are just some of them, but there are many more. As you can probably assume, all of these websites have their good and bad sides.\n\nFor example, Toptal provides you only with top 3% of freelance app developers from across the world. Because of this, it is more expensive to hire a developer here than on the other sites. Freelancer, on the other hand, has the opposite problem \u2014 having a lot of developers to choose from means that you are going to have to carefully balance work quality and costs.\n\nFortunately, these sites are only the beginning of the list.\n\nIf you are a developer yourself, don\u2019t hesitate to check out StackOverflow or GitHub, and remember that there\u2019s always LinkedIn and Twitter to take into consideration.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless you just have to know what profile of a developer you are searching for.\n\nIn one of our previous articles, I wrote about what being an entrepreneur in 2018 is like. I mentioned that a founder should never forget about the benefits of networking and I am sticking by this piece of advice.\n\nSo, the next time you hear there is a conference or a meetup nearby, be sure not to skip it. You never know who you\u2019ll meet.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget about local colleges and universities. If it counts, Kolosek attended one of the university fairs in Novi Sad which offers students possibilities to talk to company representatives and find more about the team, the development process etc. We have actually met some pretty cool app developers at that fair!\n\nSo, after you have collected all the data and met up with a developer or two, all that is left for you to do is contact them \u2014 this can be via email, a LinkedIn message or one of the freelance sites I mentioned. Before you do contact them, though, don\u2019t forget to check your chosen developers\u2019 portfolios in details.\n\nWhen looking at a portfolio, what should you pay attention to? Seeing that most developers nowadays have their own websites, let their websites talk to you. Pay attention to the design and the portfolio section. Good app developers have a list of dozens or even a hundred projects they worked on. If you can\u2019t get the entire picture from these projects, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for a more detailed portfolio.\n\nAfter analyzing the portfolios, the next logical step is to schedule a Skype call or an interview. During any type of communication, be sure to ask the right questions and remember: developers\u2019 experience is one of the most important things. The longer app developers are on the market, the easier it is to work with them.\n\nFinding the right app developers requires a lot of planning, questioning and researching, so be prepared for all of that. In short: it\u2019s not exactly a picnic.\n\nWhat you want to do is find a developer/developers/a company that is reliable, easy to talk to and is transparent about the project. Remember, communication is the key to a good collaboration.\n\nThank you for reading the article to the very end. I hope I have provided you with some useful information on how to find the right app developers for your project.\n\nHow did you manage to find developers for your startup? What did you pick\u30fchiring employees, freelancers or working with a development company? Share your experience in the comment section below!"

        "title": "Zero Customer Wait Time \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Recently, a couple of articles referred to a story detailed in the book \u201cThe Everything Store\u201d by Brad Stone. Back in 2000, with Christmas sales ramping up and customer wait time is getting longer, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asked his Global VP of Customer service what the wait times were. His VP assured Bezos that the wait times were well under a minute.\n\nRather than asking questions, Bezos took the \u201ctrust but verify\u201d approach. He dialed Amazon\u2019s 800 number on the speakerphone in the conference room and started tracking the time with his watch. After four and a half minutes, someone finally answered the call. He was not happy to say the least.\n\nJeff Bezos was obsessed with the customer experience. More importantly, he understands people hate to wait! Amazon Go is a testament of how Bezos is laser focus on eliminating customer wait time. Amazon opens its first Amazon Go grocery store to the public back in Jan 21 this year. There are no cashiers, no lines and no registers. In other words, there is no waiting. The only thing you need is your smartphone.\n\nIn order to shop, you will need the Amazon Go app and link it to a payment method. To enter the store, you scan a QR code from the app on the turnstile. After that, you can put your phone away and do your shopping.\n\nLong customer wait time is a problem for many businesses and not just at companies like Amazon. One business come to mind quickly is the restaurant industry especially in San Francisco Bay Area as many of the restaurants are notorious for long wait time and the problem is exacerbated by shortage of workers due to the high cost of living.\n\nAccording to a study done by Long Range System back in October 2013, restaurants have wait lists an average of 6.6 hours per week, with parties waiting nearly half an hour on average for a table. The data indicates that nearly 93 percent of restaurants have at least some wait-time periods, and 30 percent of restaurants report that waits are getting longer. Unless it is very good food, not many of us are willing to wait for more than 30 minutes especially if we are very hungry! Most of the times, customers will go to another restaurant if the hostess tells them the wait time is over 30 minutes.\n\nOn a recent trip to China, I was impressed by the way how many of the restaurants have leveraged the smartphone to improve the customer experience and decrease the wait time. In addition to waiting in line for a table, people spend a lot of time waiting to order food and waiting for the check. By decreasing the time it takes to order food and getting the check, restaurant owners can focus on optimizing their staff to deliver a much better customer experience.\n\nHere is how it works. Once you get seated at a table, you can just scan the QR code sticker on the table with your mobile apps like the one above. A menu like the one below will then pop up and you can start ordering food from the menu.\n\nMany of us probably have the unpleasant experience of waiting for the waitress to take our order but she took someone else order first. In this case, you can do everything yourself. You do not have to wait for the waitress to order the food. In addition, it will tell you if a dish is sold out already. You won\u2019t have to wait for the waitress to come back ten minutes later to ask you to order something else as the dish you ordered is already sold out. However, waitresses are still available to help if you have questions about the food like how it is cooked or is it spicy etc. With the smartphone ordering, it also minimizes the chance of having the food you ordered delivered to the wrong table.\n\nOnce you finished eating, you do not have to wait for the waitress to hand you the check which can take a long time if the restaurant is busy. You can just choose the mobile payment method and pay the bill. Instead of spending two hours just for the meal, customers can finish in an hour. Customers will have much better experience and the restaurants can serve more customers which in turn reduces wait time to get a table.\n\nOutside of the restaurant industry, the hotel industry is another industry that is making good use of the smartphone technology to create a more enjoyable customer experience. Instead of calling room service, a customer can use their smartphone apps like the one below to request anything from amenities like towels and toiletries to services like housekeeping and luggage assistance anytime. This is especially useful during night time when hotels have less staff on duty to answer the phone.\n\nEvery industry has its own bottlenecks which often resulted into long wait time. Using smartphone apps to enable self service to decrease wait time will help create a better customer experience and allow the business to focus on its core value. Ultimately, businesses and consumers can both benefit from it!"

        "title": "The Who\u2019s and Whys of Your Startup Will Determine Whether it Lives or Dies",
        "text": "Full disclosure, I\u2019m not a small business owner. I\u2019ve just been around and worked closely with them over the last fifteen years. They\u2019ve hired me and promoted me and kept me close for a reason. Because I know what I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t know why the phrase startup has such a Silicon valley and techy feel to it but it does so just to clarify \u2014 When I said startup in the title, I\u2019m more so referring to small businesses. Not the next big app to take off or the trending company that\u2019s working on the newest social media platform but just everyday people who decided they wanted to work for themselves and started mom and pop shop construction companies, local deli\u2019s and roofing companies. Those are the people I\u2019ve gotten my experience from \u2014 watched closely \u2014 seen what they did right and what they did wrong. What their strengths and weaknesses were and ultimately why they\u2019ve succeeded thus far or eventually failed. Though I got my experience and drew my lessons from small business owners, much of the following can and should be applied to business in general \u2014 regardless of size or industry.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a keen observer. Few things go over my head or get by me. I like to think I know people pretty well. Both individuals close to me and just the human species at large. I can tell you right now, what makes or breaks a company \u2014 especially in the beginning \u2014 is who is at the head of it and who they hire. Sounds obvious right? Well so many people get it wrong. People who have no business starting businesses do so to make their ego\u2019s wet dream come true. in order to finally have someone call them boss. These are the companies that\u2019re doomed from the start. Companies built by egomaniacs who started one because they were inspired by a YouTube ad, think it leads to Lambo\u2019s and luxury and just want to impress others, are completely doomed from the start. I\u2019ve seen them come and watched them go.\n\nSo many people have a really misconstrued idea of what working for yourself is like. They romanticize it. They exaggerate the positives and completely ignore the negatives. You know what owning a small business is really like? Well from what I\u2019ve seen, I think Gary Vaynerchuk summed it up best when he said he\u2019s basically a firefighter, because he spends most of his days just putting out metaphorical business fires. I like to think of it as problem solving though and clearly, that\u2019s what Gary means. owning a business, at least an even semi successful one, involves constant problems, minor and large. The expected and completely unforeseen. Ones you can\u2019t ignore or walk away from like you can when you\u2019re just an employee, as you think to yourself \u201cnot my job, not my problem\u201d . Because I assure you, as a business owner, it\u2019s precisely your problem. Finding a solution to those problems, is your primary purpose.\n\nThese are the aspects of starting a startup everyone chooses to ignore, while they idolize Tai Lopez and envision themselves as the next Grant Cardone. They ignore the work and zoom in on the benefits. They see the light but not the dark tunnel that led to it and it\u2019s honestly astonishing to me. People playing make pretend with their very real lives. The fairy tale is not a reality.\n\nAside from who is starting the startup or small business and why, the next biggest threat to it\u2019s existence is who the owner or founder hires by hand. The people he or she appoint to top positions. From the faces of the company to project managers and foreman \u2014 get this wrong too often and your chances of making it past the 3 year mark that so many small businesses don\u2019t, drop drastically.\n\nIf the people you depend on to run day to day operations can\u2019t only mainly solve the inevitable barrage of problems headed their way but also hopefully foresee and plan for a few of them, you probably hired the wrong person. This is an offense your company may be able to survive but it\u2019ll also make it damn near impossible for it to thrive. Think about it like this, if your ultimate long term goal is to eventually take a step back, are these the people you could depend on to run the company without you having to constantly fight their fires for them? If not, you should find people who are as soon as possible.\n\nNone of this is meant to discourage anyone from starting a business. It more so just stands as a forewarning to people who want to start them for the wrong reasons. As crazy as this is to say, even focusing on money in the beginning is wrong. Yeah, of course your goal should be to make money \u2014 but I promise you if it\u2019s your only focus you\u2019ll fail. There\u2019s too many other good reasons to start a business, it\u2019s almost as if the entrepreneurial Gods view monetizing your motives as petty. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t succeed despite them but why spite them when you could have them on your side?\n\nConsider this not a discouragement but a guide in the right direction, based solely off my experience. I\u2019ve essentially spent the better part of my working career, working side by side with entrepreneurs and small business owners. Many of who I\u2019ve got to be there with when they opened doors on day one \u2014 and a few who have unfortunately closed doors since. It just kills me to know they didn\u2019t have to, so I figured I\u2019d write this and hopefully help prevent one small business owner from shutting down shop for good unnecessarily."

        "title": "Three Alternative Revenue Sources for \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "In yesterday\u2019s post, I explained why Medium\u2019s subscription business isn\u2019t sustainable. In essence, it satisfies neither readers nor writers.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Medium, and I want it to succeed. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to share alternative income sources for Medium in this post.\n\nCurrent Model Is Good for Users But Unsustainable\n\nI\u2019m not motivated by my interests when criticizing the current model and proposing alternatives. The current model is more beneficial for me than the one I suggest.\n\nThe current model gives me an excellent, ad-free platform to publish my posts and reach a significant audience. I\u2019m afraid this won\u2019t last long.\n\nI propose a model that is less beneficial for me in the short term, but that will keep Medium afloat longer. That way, it will benefit us, writers and readers, in the long run.\n\nLet\u2019s go over the three alternative income sources for Medium.\n\nIf you charge for the opportunity to post on Medium, writers will approach the platform with greater respect.\n\nSimilar to the current system, a writer can publish three posts for free in a given month. That gives an opportunity to everybody to publish on the platform. Anything more than that will require the writer to pay Medium.\n\nWriters would pay Medium for the exposure they get and for the audience they reach. That exposure and audience aren\u2019t available anywhere else for free. It has a value that can be monetized.\n\nIn this system, commenting will be free. If someone wants to publish a 45-minute post as a comment, that\u2019s fine.\n\nIf my observations are correct, comments aren\u2019t distributed as widely as standalone posts. Therefore, the writers who publish their posts as comments won\u2019t get as much distribution as the writers who pay the subscription fee.\n\nCharge Writers for Increased Distribution of Their Posts\n\nWriters benefit from getting their posts distributed to a relevant audience. They could increase their benefits by getting their posts distributed to more people. They could pay for that extra distribution.\n\nI assume Medium is considering several criteria when distributing a post to an audience. These criteria might include the engagement of the readers, the tags of the post, the followers of the writer, and so on.\n\nEach criterion has a weight in calculating the relevance score of a post to a reader. The posts with a higher score are displayed in a higher position to a reader.\n\nI suggest keeping the weight of the distribution fee between 10% and 20% in the overall score of a post. If this weight is lower than 10%, writers won\u2019t find it interesting to pay the distribution fee. If it is above 20%, the overall quality of the platform will suffer.\n\nNowadays, data is a gold mine, and privacy is a problem. In his last post, Ev Williams, CEO of Medium, states that Medium doesn\u2019t sell data to third parties. This is an uncommon practice on the web.\n\nAlmost all digital products and services collect user data and sell it to third parties. This practice is a source of income for many websites.\n\nAs I explained in my post on privacy, I recommend online businesses to offer two types of memberships to their users.\n\nThe first type is the free membership. Free memberships are subsidized by selling user data to third parties. This is the current online standard. Most of the websites, products, and services you use on a daily basis are funded with this system.\n\nThe second type is a privacy-protected premium membership. In this tier, user data is not sold to third parties, but the user pays for the benefit.\n\nMedium is leaving a lot of money on the table by not collecting and selling data to third parties. This alone could beat the income from their current paid membership model.\n\nIt Isn\u2019t Possible to Safeguard Data Anyway\n\nYou might oppose this model, but third parties probably collect the data you enter to Medium and sell it further.\n\nIf you use Google\u2019s Chrome browser or the Android OS, Google is collecting and commercializing your data anyway, even when you use Medium.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t use Google products, data finds its way to third parties. Here\u2019s an experience I had recently.\n\nI access Medium only via Firefox on a Windows PC and Medium\u2019s iOS app. Recently, I added a comment about IKEA to a Medium post. A few hours later, YouTube started to show me IKEA ads on another device.\n\nI have no idea how that data is leaked to Google, but it leaked anyway. Data finds its way to third parties. Why not sell it yourself and charge the people who want to protect their privacy?\n\nMedium\u2019s current subscription-based business model doesn\u2019t seem sustainable in the long run. There are three alternative revenue sources for Medium.\n\nThese revenue sources seem to put readers and writers in a disadvantaged position in the short term, but they are more sustainable than the current model in the long run.\n\nIf the current model fails, we will lose Medium altogether. Paying for publishing posts, increased distribution, and privacy protection is a small price to pay to keep Medium afloat."

If we really want to oppose everything they\u2019re saying why not focus on ourselves here in Hollywood.\n\nAnyone been to Hollywood lately?\n\nI\u2019ve got to be honest.\n\nIf you take a stroll down the Boulevard at 7pm on a Friday evening you will will feel so confused, horrified, baffled, bedazzled, and utterly disgusted that you literally will have thought you\u2019d slipped into the 7th circle of hell. It\u2019s appalling.\n\nIf I were the mayor I\u2019d be like the guy with the bulldozer in \u201cEarnest Goes To Camp.\u201d\n\nBut something must be done. I mean this doesn\u2019t have to look like Beverly Hills. But can it at least look mildly presentable?\n\nIf the city of Los Angeles is out of money, fine. But oh man, it\u2019s really bad out there.\n\nWhy not just call in the cleaning crews. The streets are so dirty one would think they are this way purposefully. I\u2019m serious.\n\nI can only imagine tourists from across the world coming here these days and seeing this dirt. They must be absolutely bewildered.\n\nI hate to say it, but it really does look like Biff\u2019s world from \u201cBack To The Future\u201d.\n\nThe first minute of the video below is what 2018 Hollywood Boulevard looks like on a Friday or Saturday night:"

        "text": "Both the products we build and how we build them are important. Great teams put time not just into building, but into finding risk in their projects and solving for it.\n\nWe know our working relationships are important to the success of any project. Studies from places like Google show that performance is best predicted not by the smarts of the people on the team, but by the way they work together.\n\nSo why do we have so many well used tools to mitigate product risk, but so few to mitigate relationship risks?\n\nWell for one, humans are way harder to understand than code. If you\u2019re looking for one tool to add to your toolbox for relationship building, I\u2019d like to nominate the pre-mortem.\n\nTeams use pre-mortems to help them find ways their project could go wrong and then try to prevent it. Pre-mortems also make sure that all voices are heard before a project goes forward \u2014making them a great tool to combat group think.\n\nIn a pre-mortem, the team brainstorms ways the project could fail in the future, and then work backwards to understand how to prevent those potential futures. It\u2019s a way to help teams make sure they\u2019ve considered all sources of potential risk.\n\nI\u2019ve been using pre-mortems to establish better work relationships faster.\n\nSome leaders already do this all the time, but it\u2019s worth labelling and calling out as a specific tool to think about and use.\n\nI work at Shopify Plus as part of what we call a \u201ctrifecta\u201d. I represent Product Management, and have a counterpart UX Lead and Engineering Lead. Together, the three of us are responsible for the success of the teams in our area and the products we build.\n\nUntil a few months ago, we hadn\u2019t yet hired a UX Lead for my trifecta. The Eng Lead and I were more of a duo. And we\u2019d been working together for over a year so were in a good groove. Then we hired a kickass UX Lead.\n\nThrough an informal conversation, we talked through all the ways we could fail. Generally I\u2019m an optimist, so it\u2019s not my first inclination to talk about failure. But that experience taught me that talking about failure can help foster success.\n\nFollow these steps (formally, or just in spirit) to conduct a pre-mortem on your own relationships.\n\nStep 0: Know your relationship goals first\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t start a project pre-mortem without knowing what your project was. So, don\u2019t start this conversation until you all have some idea of why and how you might be working together.\n\nStart the pre-mortem by reminding each other and agreeing on your goals.\n\nFor my trifecta, we talked about goals and how we thought we might work together.\n\nStep 1: Ask yourselves \u201cin what ways can this relationship fail\u201d?\n\nTalk about ways in which you might fail. Brainstorm ways your relationships could fall apart in short and long term.\n\nIn my trifecta, we identified a few key ways we could fail:\n\nStep 2: Work backwards to identify symptoms and preemptive solutions\n\nFor each failure, identify behaviours that would show you\u2019re heading on that path. Then, talk about ways to prevent them.\n\nStep 3: Check back in\n\nPut in place your strategies and see what happens. Circle back regularly to check in \u2014 are we seeing these symptoms? Are there new potential ways we\u2019re failing? Have our behaviours changed for the better?\n\nHaving had this conversation, I felt confident later talking about how we were doing . We all agreed on potential ways we could fail so were confident in calling out symptoms when we saw them.\n\nPre-mortems are great for projects because they help us head off potential mistakes, and they create a place where it\u2019s safe to talk about failure. The same thing happens when we apply them to relationships.\n\nWe can throw out the expectations. No relationship is perfect at first. By starting with discussing the ways we could fail, we shatter any preconceived notions of immediate perfection. We make it safe to talk about our flaws and failures, present and future.\n\nWe can start with vulnerability. An honest discussion of failure means being open about fears and shortcomings. Once you\u2019ve been vulnerable once, it becomes easier and easier to continue to be open and honest.\n\nWe have concrete behaviours to look for and call out. It\u2019s simpler to point out something to correct. We\u2019ve all agreed already, so the conversation is much easier.\n\nBut most of all, we\u2019ll build intentional relationships. Rather than hoping relationships will go well, let\u2019s intentionally design the way we work with each other.\n\nYou should conduct relationship pre-mortems because your relationships are important."

        "title": "How to Lose Your First 10 SaaS Customers \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "There are a number of great resources available to early-stage startups who are trying to land their first 10 paying customers. Doing so is no small task. It can take hard work, hustle and sometimes a bit of luck.\n\nIn the world of subscription-based software sales, customer churn is inevitable. At Akita, we make Customer Success software to help companies combat churn. Yet today we ourselves reached a major milestone\u2026\n\nAre we glad we lost 10 customers? No, of course not. But we realize that it\u2019s a fact of life in SaaS. It also means that we landed our 10th customer long ago and \u2014 by Jason Lemkin\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that means we \u2018have something\u2019. Most importantly, each and every time we have lost a customer, we have done our best to learn why they churned and how we can prevent losing customers for the same reason in the future.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the 10 reasons why we lost our first 10 customers what we learned each time.\n\nOne of our customers was unable to get the internal developer resources to integrate with our software. Without this integration, they only recognized a fraction of the value our platform might have provided and therefore did not achieve their desired outcome or return on investment.\n\nSolution: While you can\u2019t directly solve this problem, you can work with the customer before the sale to make sure they have secured the necessary resources to make the project successful. This might lengthen the sales cycle or delay kickoff but you will greatly enhance your odds of success.\n\nAnother early customer of ours was near the end of our onboarding process when they abruptly canceled their subscription. We learned that the decision was made, not by the primary contact, but by their boss who wanted to place financial resources elsewhere.\n\nSolution: Get sponsorship from the highest rung on the ladder as early as possible \u2014 ideally during the sales process. Keep track of any changes in this hierarchy and if a sponsor leaves the company, get their replacement engaged immediately!\n\nOne of our customers was just dipping their toes into Customer Success. They completed their onboarding and were beginning to roll out the solution when a decision was made to emphasize Customer Support at the expense of Customer Success. Resources were moved from one department to the other and they decided to cancel their subscription until things \u201ccalmed down a bit\u201d.\n\nSolution: If you sense a change in priorities, see if changes to their subscription might extend the relationship until their priorities swing back in your direction.\n\nOne of our customers chose Akita based on the forecasted launch date of their new software product. Delays in launching their product ultimately meant they wouldn\u2019t need a Customer Success Management platform any time soon.\n\nSolution: Sometimes there is not much you can do! Make sure you market to these ex-Customers as they might just sign up again down the road.\n\nWe had a short-lived customer who wanted to use Akita for a single, very specific use case. Ultimately the value derived from this single feature didn\u2019t justify the cost of the complete solution.\n\nSolution: Churn is often caused by \u201cbad-fit\u201d customers but we should learn lessons where we can. Perhaps a more modular solution will allow us to build a more flexibly priced solution that can accommodate customers like this one.\n\nWe lost a promising customer because we never fully onboarded them. This was due to inefficiencies in our onboarding process at the time, changes in their data strategy and delays in new features they requested.\n\nSolution: Nail the onboarding. Once the kickoff call starts, a clock starts ticking and you are in a race to deliver value. A well-organized onboarding process will help you reduce the time to first value and set up your relationship for success.\n\nOne customer subscribed to Akita while evaluating several solutions in parallel. While there were things they preferred about Akita, ultimately a competing product was a better fit for their specific use case.\n\nSolution: Don\u2019t worry about your competitors (too much!). Make sure your product team continually evaluates the competitive landscape, adapts and innovates. While your product team is hard at work, continue to educate your customers about the unique value your product can provide them.\n\nSoon after we launched, a well-established software company kicked off a paid trial but did not move forward with their subscription. At the time, our product just wasn\u2019t mature enough to deliver their desired outcome. We lacked features our competitors had, parts of our application were difficult to use and we even had (gasp) bugs.\n\nSolution: Launch early! The feedback we received from our early customers has been invaluable. The sooner you launch, the sooner you will be mature enough for even the most discerning customers. Be prepared to lose a few customers and take their feedback to heart!\n\nNo matter how closely your sales and customer success teams are aligned, inevitably your sales team will sign a customer who just doesn\u2019t need the product they were sold. We had a customer who thought they needed a Customer Success Platform but really just needed a CRM. They were never going to get the ROI the required from our platform and would always be missing key features that were not on our roadmap. After an early conversation, we agreed that they should look for a solution elsewhere.\n\nSolution: Make sure your sales team is incentivized to deliver customers who need your product and who your Customer Success department can make successful. When bad-fit customers do slip through the cracks it is best to address the situation head-on and part ways before the relationship becomes toxic and adversely affects your reputation.\n\nOur software is highly customizable and can be configured to each customer\u2019s requirements. This process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. We lost a customer when they expected immediate utility from the application and which, in their case, required a longer-than-normal setup phase.\n\nSolution: Set expectations early on in the customer-vendor relationship. Make sure each party knows what their responsibilities will be to ensure a successful implementation.\n\nWhat is important is that you learn something each and every time it happens and that you have processes and tools in place to help eliminate churn whenever possible!"

        "title": "Busting Productivity Myths \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "The chase for better productivity has truly become everyone\u2019s obsession these days. The amount of tips, tricks and strategies available online is simply astounding. Go ahead and google \u2018productivity\u2019 and you will end up with over 68 million results! You would think that with this amount of helpful advice from productivity gurus we should all be in our absolute top form, destroying deadlines and delivering quality work in less time. And yet, we seem to be struggling with managing our time and controlling our focus as much as before. Clearly, something\u2019s not right here. Things like stress, multitasking, procrastination and many others get almost universally labeled as the worst enemies of any productive individual. The truth, however, is never so simple. And by taking some of those widely-accepted productivity ideas at face value, you may actually be undermining your efforts to be more productive. But how can you tell which ones have real merit and which are pure fiction? Here are a some of the most common productivity myths that we think it\u2019s time to put to bed for good.\n\nIt\u2019s a scientific fact that the human brain cannot effectively perform two mental tasks at the same time. So yes, constantly switching from one thing to another does little to improve your productivity. You lose your focus, and it becomes impossible to maintain a steady workflow.\n\nHowever, this jumping between tasks is not the same as multitasking. What is multitasking is doing more than one thing at a time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not an easy thing to do for most people, sure. However, recent scientific findings demonstrate that multitasking might not be that bad for us. In fact, a study conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong shows that in some situations multitasking can be beneficial.\n\nThe key is in finding tasks that complement each other, rather than those that require the same type of cognitive effort. Like listening to a podcast while cooking a meal, or planning your week while exercising.\n\nProcrastination gets a bad rep for being just an excuse for lazy and undisciplined behavior. There is definitely some truth to it, of course. Like if you\u2019re watching YouTube videos or browsing your Facebook feed instead of working on an important work assignment, procrastination can become a very real roadblock on your way to better productivity.\n\nBut in some circumstances, putting things off to do something else can help you remain productive.\n\nProfessor John Perry of Stanford University, who openly admits his procrastinating tendencies, highlights the difference between regular procrastination and what he calls \u201cstructured procrastination\u201d. The former according to him is simply not doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. While the latter means you don\u2019t waste any time, and while avoiding one particular task, you do something else of equal importance instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty common practice to start your work day by knocking out a bunch of small routine tasks first \u2014 replying to emails, checking voicemail or filing paperwork.\n\nIt makes sense to get the busywork out of the way so you can devote the rest of your day to the bigger tasks, right? Well, no. As far as science is concerned, it\u2019s a far better idea to begin your work day with something larger and more important.\n\nYou see, our mental resources are not unlimited and by choosing to spend our precious brain power on trivial things at the start of the day, when we\u2019re at our most focused and alert, means having less energy for more meaningful things down the line.\n\nSo making a habit out of doing the most important task first thing in the morning could the key to maximizing your productivity.\n\nIf you\u2019re of those people who have trouble getting out of bed with the alarm, it\u2019s probably fair to say that you\u2019ve heard this tired adage at least a few (dozen) times: \u201cthe early bird gets the worm\u201d.\n\nIf you try waking up at 5AM every morning, you will definitely have more time to have a proper breakfast, hit the gym, and get an early start at work. But unless you\u2019re a morning person, what you would also do is get really really tired. And, as a result, unproductive before your work day even hit its midpoint.\n\nA research conducted by scientists at the University of Liege in Belgium cast some serious doubt on the popular idea that being an early riser translates to better productivity. They studied the brain activity of two groups of people with significantly different sleep patterns (night owls and early birds) while they took reaction-time tests an hour and a half and 10 and a half hours after waking up.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, it was discovered that in the morning, shortly after the wakeup call, there was no significant difference in the brain function of early birds and night owls. What\u2019s more fascinating, the evening test showed that night owls were noticeably less tired and had much sharper reaction times than the early birds. Put simply, those who woke up later in the day could stay mentally focused for longer before feeling exhausted.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying you should start sleeping till noon, mind you. Just be sure not to rush into changing your established routine if it already works well for you. Some people are early birds, some are more productive in the late hours, while the rest are somewhere in the middle. And that\u2019s perfectly okay!\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic how many people fall for this one, actively confusing being busy with being productive. Nothing wrong with being busy per se, but assuming that you\u2019re being productive just because you\u2019re buried under a pile of busywork is all kinds of wrong.\n\nSure, it may feel like got you\u2019ve got a lot done having spent an hour crossing items off your to-do list. But if that list was filled with low priority tasks, then you have effectively wasted an entire hour of your time on unimportant stuff. Time that could\u2019ve been better spent on making real progress on a bigger assignment.\n\nStop chasing quantity, because it\u2019s quality you should be after. Sorting through all 1,278 unread emails in your inbox may feel great, but finishing a couple of paragraphs of that big article due this week would be a lot more productive.\n\nWhen researching advice for increased productivity it\u2019s pretty easy to get overwhelmed with tips that seemingly contradict one another. One hint can be lauded as the single best thing you need to perform better by one author, while being slammed by another as something you should avoid doing at all costs.\n\nThe smart thing to do, of course, is to not take everything you read on the internet at face value. Just remember that there\u2019s no universal approach, and the effectiveness of any particular method largely depends on the individual. So if your way of doing things has been working perfectly fine for you so far, even if experts advise against it, there might be no need to change anything."

        "title": "5 Things to Improve Time Management Within a Team \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Any middle manager building a team knows the struggle of improving productivity in the workplace. It\u2019s hard to motivate employees to do their best, get to know their time management skills, and get insights on how to improve time management within the team. Luckily, there are some practical things busy entrepreneurs and team managers can do to not just boost their personal productivity and organization but let their teams thrive together with that. Let\u2019s see how.\n\nBe sure to track your team\u2019s time expenses \u2014 and select the right tool for that purpose. Sometimes, tracking time takes too much time, which destroys the very idea of that.\n\nSo you\u2019d need an efficient tool if you want to manage a team of workers more effectively. It can enhance your business in multiple ways: from managing work assignments and tracking time to running reports and analyzing them, so you can spot weak points and amend them.\n\nThe best thing about a specialized product is that it allows you to see what everyone is working on, simplify payroll calculation and deliver projects on time. The tool can be adapted to your work process and used to cut business costs.\n\nOne aspect of all this could be a bit challenging though: people are often reluctant to adopt new tools. Let\u2019s see how to do it right so you and your team can boost your productivity with less effort.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to introduce the new software product, give people some instructions and let them start using it from day one. But that\u2019s not always effective: help with on boarding is often necessary.\n\nTo do this right and eliminate the shock of novelty for people in the workplace, do it in small steps. Instruct your employees in detail how they should use the tool. Also, focus on the benefits each team member will see.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to be an active user yourself. Your employees aren\u2019t going to adopt a piece of technology you don\u2019t seem fond of.\n\nExperts say the first step to better time management is knowing exactly where our time is spent. Now you can achieve that and bring your team along on the journey.\n\nIf you want to be a step ahead of the competition and grow as a manager, you\u2019ll need to take a step back and see whether your practices are truly effective. That requires reviewing your management techniques, talking to colleagues and workers and getting feedback, and taking notes.\n\nAfter that, spend a few days outlining your current habits and practices as a manager, brainstorm ideas on what could be changed. Maybe it\u2019s time for a slightly different direction. Or maybe having new people on board or entering a new niche means you have to build new skills or continue your training.\n\nNot just that, but you should take into consideration the management at all levels in the company. They can go through the process too. This ensures each department is up to date with their project management, culture company, collaboration and incentive programs.\n\nWith smart time management techniques, people can start getting done in less time. The same goes for busy entrepreneurs who are responsible for a whole team. You can find ways to manage less when actually achieving the progress you\u2019re after.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with managing too much? It\u2019s that you don\u2019t delegate enough or coach people on your team.\n\nManagement itself takes up a big chunk of your time. But what about the desire to inspire your team to get more done, to help employees build new skills with training, to find new talents and get them on board, and to take big decisions?\n\nThe only way to start doing all these again is to cut down on management busywork.\n\nOne thing that will help you get there is to stop expecting that much from your workers and instead focus on taking responsibility for the project preparation phase.\n\nMultiple studies suggest that remote talent is the future and the reasons for that are many. Remote employees are those who have found the balance between work and personal life and are pretty happy with how they are living.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what you need \u2014 happy faces during meetings. Such people are energetic but motivated to do a good job and disciplined enough at the same time.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, get more remote workers on your team. This allows you to choose some passionate and hard-working individuals from around the globe instead of being limited by location.\n\nOnce you have more of them on your team, and after the training period, you\u2019d be able to delegate whole aspects of the project to them and let them do what they are good at.\n\nThis leaves you with more time to concentrate on what matters, such as business growth.\n\nNo busy entrepreneur should end up stressed or forget that there\u2019s a team they\u2019re responsible for. Follow the tips above and be a productive manager of employees who knows how to manage their own time."

        "title": "How does Bitcoin / Blockchain Mining work? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "This is where start adding layers of complexity. Buckle up!\n\nBlocks in the blockchain have another field which we have not spoke about yet. This field is called \u201cThe Nonce\u201d which stands for number used only once:\n\nThe Nonce is an integer number and along with the Block Number, Data and Previous hash the Nonce serves as an input for the SHA256 function to calculate the current block\u2019s hash:\n\nUnlike other components of a block, the Nonce is designed to be totally under our control. This means that now we have a mechanism to vary the current block\u2019s hash while keeping the data inside it intact. Indeed, thanks to the nature of the hash function (property #3 in our discussion above), every time we select a new Nonce for the same block the resulting hash will be a different value.\n\nAlright, that\u2019s great. But what has any of this got to do with mining? This is where we come to the fun stuff.\n\nThere is a total of 16\u2076\u2074 possible SHA256 cryptographic hash values (each hexadecimal digit has 16 possible values and there are 64 of them in a hash). However, not all of them are valid hashes. Why is that? Well, every two weeks the Bitcoin network will define a minimal target for the hash. Anything above this target will be rejected, anything below \u2014 accepted.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the pool (not to be confused with \u2018mining pool\u2019) of all possible SHA256 hashes \u2014 starting at the bottom with smallest and increasing towards the largest at the top. Somewhere along the vertical we have the target. Note that this diagram is for illustrative purposes only as it is not proportionate \u2014 we\u2019ll see why in a bit.\n\nAt the time of writing the target is:\n\nWhat is really important in the target is the number of leading zeroes. Just like in the decimal system, leading zeros in a fixed-size number will determine its magnitude. Every leading zero reduces the number\u2019s magnitude by a factor of 16 (ten in the decimal system, but here we\u2019re working with hexadecimals).\n\nThere are 18 leading zeros in the current target, meaning that the number of total valid hashes is 16\u2074\u2076 (only 64-18=46 non-zero digits remain). Therefore, the probability that a randomly picked hash is valid can be calculated as:\n\nIn Bitcoin mining terms, this is the probability that any given Nonce value will generate a valid hash for the current block. We can now see why the diagram is out of proportion: the pool of valid hashes in reality is extremely small in comparison to the complete SHA256 pool.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the cryptographic puzzle is all about: miners compete to find a Nonce (also called a Golden Nonce) which will generate a valid hash for the upcoming block. Whoever finds it first is allowed to add the block to the chain and get\u2019s their reward of 12.5 Bitcoins. At the time of writing one Bitcoin is worth around $10,000 USD making mining a rather worthwhile activity.\n\nHow to read this diagram: the red \u2018X\u2019 marks relate to SHA256 hashes while the labels beside them illustrate which Nonce generated which hash value.\n\nThe target is defined based on the network\u2019s hashrate (aggregate computational power of all Bitcoin miners). The more miners join the network \u2014 the lower the target will be, and therefore the harder it will be to find a suitable hash. The goal of this difficulty algorithm is to ensure that only one new block to is added every 10 minutes. This is part of the Bitcoin monetary policy to control the total number of coins in circulation.\n\nIn a nutshell, that\u2019s what the millions and millions of mining machines are doing day and night \u2014 they are simply iterating different values of the Nonce in hopes of being the first to find a valid hash for the next block. Once a valid hash if found, the block is added to the chain and the race starts over again, this time for the next block."

        "text": "One of the biggest names in finance, Goldman Sachs, is set to launch a Bitcoin trading operation. It would be the first one introduced by a Wall Street bank. The bank\u2019s own money will be used to trade in contracts linked to Bitcoin\u2019s price, with clients. Once it can get the regulatory green light and find the right approach to manage the associated risks, there is also a chance Goldman Sachs might even start buying and selling Bitcoin. Managing Director Rana Yared, who is involved with the project, noted how the technology\u2019s perception has evolved. The fact that the bank would even contemplate the idea of trading Bitcoin is proof of how the times have changed.\n\n2. JP Morgan Is Working On A Proof-of-concept For Blockchain Project\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s commercial bank is currently developing a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a blockchain-backed debt trading system. The project was confirmed by a representative from JP Morgan Chase. The syndicated debt trading platform in question will be employed internally. Starting from the commercial bank, will then be expanded to other sub-banks, if successful. Despite still being a notion, the plan is to finish the PoC by July 30th and then implement the platform in December of this year. However, this is not the first time the firm is involved with blockchain. In fact, we previously reported on JP Morgan collaborating with Bank of Canada as well as other big firms to trial the issuance of financial instruments on blockchain.\n\nIn February, we reported on Berkeley\u2019s plan to issue tokenised bonds to raise funds. A project led by vice mayor Ben Bartlett. The Californian city is now moving forward with its project. If successful, it would be the first municipality to employ blockchain technology in this sphere. On Tuesday, a vote to ask the city manager for a potential pilot venture passed in the City Council. However, some members expressed the need for more information. Tokenised bonds would allow the city to issue bonds at a lower price than the conventional minimum of $5,000. The minibonds and their transactions would then be registered on distributed ledger technology.\n\n4. Statnett Says Lack Of Engineers With Knowledge Of Blockchain Is Blocking Energy Sector Revolution\n\nNorwegian state-owned stem power grid operator Statnett thinks that blockchain technology could revolutionise the energy sector, by improving its efficiency. However, a lack of engineers with knowledge of blockchain is getting in the way of this. The Norwegian company is even funding a professorship role in 2019. The topic was discussed by Research and Development Director Sonja Berlijn during an interview with Reuters. Consumers would be able to buy and sell between each other safely on blockchain. The technology, along with artificial intelligence (AI), could help controlling price spikes, as the daily consumption and distribution of power would become more efficient. This is why utilities providers such as Italian Enel, German E.ON and Swedish Vattenfall are investigating the technology. British Centrica is even launching a market trial this year."

        "text": "Because we all focus on things that are out of our control from time to time\n\nThis morning, I finished talking with Mum; just a typical mother-son catch-up.\n\nShe was on her lunch break at work, and we had a nice little chat about how our days and weeks were going so far. However, there were aspects of what she was saying that repeatedly caught my attention, resulting in this piece.\n\nNow, my parents are typical parents in many respects; born into the 60s generation, living through what I believe was a free, seemingly consequence-free 70s and 80s before the rise of the Internet and true globalization which left many of them as na\u00efve consumers who believe the biggest problem in the world is overpopulation and that global warming is just a fad; something they\u2019ve all heard before.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t everyone in this generation, but this certainly speaks broadly of many now 50-somethings I know in this rural area of the UK.\n\nThese days, my parents run a garden centre in the south-east of the UK, and it\u2019s easy to see where I find my grinding work ethic. They work up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for the vast majority of spring, summer and the beginning of autumn, having around three months off during the winter when all the plants are frozen.\n\nThey\u2019re grinders, and I love them too pieces for teaching me the worldly morals and drive I have today which surely stemmed from them, despite not being very close over the last two decades that I\u2019ve been alive.\n\n\u2026returning to the conversation, it went a little something like this;\n\nSee what she said?\n\nIn case you missed it, she\u2019s stating her day isn\u2019t really going okay because of something that is completely out of her control. However, while wind and rain may put a downer on her day, I quickly realised that this is not the only negative attribute that she has when she\u2019s self-reflecting on her own life on a daily basis.\n\nWhen she goes to the gym, she won\u2019t push herself hard enough to sweat because it\u2019s too much effort.\n\nWhen she\u2019s ill or has an ache or pain, she needs to the doctor to see whether she\u2019s okay, even if the doctor reassures her it\u2019s nothing. Only then will she start to feel better and she doesn\u2019t trust her own judgement.\n\nShe wants to lose weight but believes that she\u2019ll find the answer in a dieting book or by skipping meals, rather than simply eating the right foods and exercising throughout the day.\n\nShe becomes very stressed, very quickly, when she has multiple jobs on her to-do list, finding it hard to prioritize what she needs to complete first.\n\nThis list can go on and on, but these have all started to become connected since we had this conversation earlier today. The perspective she has on her life is always outside of herself, always with worry, the worst-case scenario, or stress.\n\nWhen she\u2019s feeling under the weather, it\u2019s always an emergency. When there\u2019s more than three things to do at work, it\u2019s the end of the world.\n\nI then realized that this effects all of us, one way or another. Earlier in the week, I was driving to the shop to pick up a delivery, but left much later than intended and was cutting it finely with the closing time of the store.\n\nThe entire drive was overflowing with stress. I was shouting at other cars to get out the way, pissed off when I couldn\u2019t find a good parking space in the closest area to the store. Goddamn pedestrians. I was getting more and more irate as the expedition continued.\n\nHowever, in hindsight, there was absolutely nothing I could have done when it came to reaching the store in time. Of course, I could drive fast, hope there\u2019s a decent parking space and walk quickly to the shop to increase my chances, but at the end of the day, if I reach the shop and it\u2019s closed, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\n\nThe other cars are still always going to be there. The pedestrians are still going to walk in front at that moment in time. All these elements are out of my control.\n\nIf it\u2019s windy and raining, you can wear waterproof clothes or take an umbrella with you to stay dry, but you can\u2019t stop it raining.\n\nYet, if you\u2019re focusing all your attention on the fact that the shop\u2019s going to close, or the weather isn\u2019t great and your going to get wet, or any other situation you care to name, you\u2019re going to feel miserable and sad, despite not being able to do anything about it.\n\nWe all forget the fact that every time we get into a car, we\u2019re driving a 2-ton missile around that can do some serious damage. Believe me, I know this more than most people.\n\nImagine you or your child is in the car with you. If you hadn\u2019t put their seat-belt on, you\u2019re going to be driving around worrying immensely about the fact that you could cause. Yet, actually putting a seat-belt on isn\u2019t physically going to stop you being involved in a crash or stop people crashing into us.\n\nInstead, the act of putting the seat-belt on takes away the worry of you thinking about being in a crash because you\u2019re being proactive in taking control of the elements you have control over.\n\nJust like taking out an umbrella or calling the shop to ask them to stay open a little later.\n\nBy taking your mind off the fact you could crash so you\u2019re not thinking about it, this makes it far less likely for the event to take place because you\u2019re simply concentrating on the act of driving and are therefore driving free from distraction.\n\nTeal Swan, an author and clairvoyant in the US, describes this mindset perfectly.\n\nShe asks her viewers to imagine they\u2019re in a barrel about to go over the edge of a waterfall. In our minds, we instantly go to the fact we\u2019re going to fall over the edge of the waterfall and we brace ourselves for what\u2019s about to happen.\n\nThe human mind works in a strange way where if you believe that you know what is going to happen in the future, even the fact of knowing about it and being aware of it, regardless of whether it\u2019s going to happen, will somehow make it less painful for you to bear, because it was something you were/are expecting.\n\nHowever, your mind become so wrapped up in the practice of bracing yourself to go over the edge of the waterfall, you forget the fact that you could simply get out of the barrel now, swim to shore and avoid toppling over in the first place.\n\nNow, when I wrote everything above this subheading, it came up like word vomit, and I decided to go and make a cup of tea.\n\nIn all honesty, this realization is still kind of blowing my mind a little bit because it can be applied to pretty much any situation you care to name.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a relationship, you could be so scared that your partner is going to leave you or that everything is going to fall apart, the chances are it probably will if you keep thinking this way. However, in the nature of getting out the barrel and swimming to the shore, you can stop that tipping point from ever arising.\n\nIf you focus your attention on the things you can\u2019t control, you\u2019ll fall into a habit of believing that everything in your life is out of your control, which can have dire consequences for your happiness and well-being.\n\nInstead, by being conscious and thinking about the things that you do have control over, you can make your life what you want it to be.\n\nYes, it really is that simple.\n\nWhen it really comes down to it, you might as well stop thinking about the things that you have no control over completely, because really, what would be the point if there\u2019s nothing you can do about them?\n\nWhen you\u2019re focusing on negative things happening in your life, you make it far more likely that they are going to happen.\n\nThis is because you\u2019re doing everything in your power to stop it from happening/hurting/scaring you/cause you pain yet, just like the barrel near the edge of the waterfall, the fall is inevitable.\n\nSo, what can you do instead \u2014 instead of going through life being miserable, worried or stressed out about the things you can\u2019t control \u2014 what do you focus on instead?\n\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, the things that you can control!\n\nIf you\u2019re getting ready to go outside and it looks like it\u2019s going to rain, simply taking the actions of picking up an umbrella or a waterproof coat can be more than enough to settle your nerves and take control over a situation that would potentially bother you.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to a shop and it\u2019s going to cause, simply calling the shop to see whether they\u2019ll stay open a few minutes later because I\u2019m running late would be a simple way of addressing the problem.\n\nIf you have a connection with a loved one, family member, partner, friend or even a stranger, you may feel like they are judging you or are thinking about you in a way that makes you feel bad about yourself.\n\nHowever, once again, you\u2019re focusing on something that isn\u2019t particularly true, nor based on any facts. This can easily be resolved with honest communication.\n\nRemember, you can never control what other people think, nor can you ever really know.\n\nWhen you\u2019re worried, stressed or sad about something, it\u2019s only because you\u2019re focusing on the negative side of things. Over excessive periods of time, which, let\u2019s be honest, most of us have been doing for many years, and this becomes a habit.\n\nAnd as I\u2019m miserably starting to find out as I\u2019m ten days into quitting smoking, every single habit can be broken.\n\nBy focusing on the areas of life and the decisions you have do have control over in your life, you start to feel empowered, no matter how small or big those elements of your lives may be.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re struggling to pay off a credit card.\n\nYou may not have any control over the amount of money you pay back each month or the amount of interest you\u2019re paying on top of your monthly payments, but ultimately, this is what you\u2019re focusing on and the fact that you can\u2019t spend that money on other things.\n\nHowever, you do have control over how much money you earn and where you\u2019re spending the money you do have, so by focusing on these areas, you can start to make real change in your life.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a relationship where you think your partner may be cheating on you and your whole world is about to fall apart, instead of focusing on the element that it may or may not happen, focus on the fact that you have the ability to start and maintain a proper conversation with your partner, and you can get to the bottom of where the problems are and how you should move forward as a couple and as individuals.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight or get fit and healthy, instead of worrying about the fact you might not be able to fit into your wedding dress in a few months, or have the bikini body you\u2019ve been searching for, or even think the people around you are judging you and think you\u2019re \u2018fat\u2019, remember that you have no control over any of those things.\n\nWhat you do have control over is the actions you\u2019re taking now when it comes to the amount you exercise, the foods that you\u2019re eating and the way that you\u2019re viewing yourself, your body and your mind."

        "text": "This is the era of social media and Smartphone apps and service-review websites, where the customers get an array of opportunities to share their views, feedback, personal experiences and also rate the product.\n\nHowever, the business entrepreneurs and app developers are apprehensive about receiving negative ratings or comments in comparison to the positive experiences. But it is extremely vital to provide a space to your end users for sharing their opinion regarding the app and its functionality.\n\nYes, it\u2019s completely true that good and positive feedback and compliments from the customers are always inspiring and encourages the developers to do even better. But as everyday is not Sunday, similarly you cannot expect to receive all good things about your app. You also have to deal with negative reviews and face criticism. But that\u2019s part and parcel of the game.\n\nOn some days you play well and on some you don\u2019t. Let this be explained through a stat. According to one of the surveys, about 77% respondents agreed that they download the app only after reading its review.\n\nAnother interesting fact that came underway through this study was that about people will download a highly rated app of an unknown brand eight times more in comparison to a low rated app of a renowned company.\n\nTherefore, as positive reviews are encouraging boosters for the app developers, similarly the negative reviews can be seen as the learning curve. It is an indication that you have to work harder on improving the app quality and functionality without getting disappointed or unsettled.\n\nYou have to take the reviews and ratings utter seriously. The problem is that most of the users do not say a single word and leave the app silently. There is nothing much you can do about it. The negative reviews act as your guide telling you the problematic areas that needs a special focus.\n\nOne of the very first steps to tackle with the negative review is plainly agreeing to the fact that there is a problem. You have to be honest and owe your mistake. That is how you can proceed in the best way.\n\nCommunicate constructively with the customers and make them believe that you are there to hear and resolve their problems. This will generate a positive feeling in users that you are addressing their issues. Your first job in hand is to calm down the stress-laden customer.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice thing to owe your fault and you know the next step that follows it; yes, approach your user with a sincere apology. A simple Sorry could prove effective and mend the relation with the reviewer.\n\nConvey the message that you regret for causing such an inconvenience or frustration. However, do not apologize right for the feelings or thoughts of the customer. This shows an unprofessional attitude.\n\nIt\u2019s quite obvious to get a gut feeling on receiving a negative feedback from anyone be it a mobile app or anything else. May be the customer has written the review or given a comment outrageously and is being rude to you, but you should never express the same feelings towards them.\n\nDo not take it on a personal note that someone has insulted you and get offended over it. Instead you need to deal with the negative comment in a calm and cool method. Don\u2019t show any unnecessary reaction that will spoil the brand image of your mobile app.\n\nNever target any reviewer on a personal note to make the situation from bad to worst. Your task is to find out the root cause of the problem, which led to such a situation.\n\nWell, the app owners and developers should be prepared to encounter it as there are people who try to exaggerate the point unnecessarily with the sole intention damaging your brand image.\n\nWell, the possible way out is to steer clear of such trolls and not respond to unwanted comments, which can further ignite the fire more. So, just ignore them and move without getting carried away.\n\nThe general tendency of human beings is going defensive as soon as we come across a negative comment, but this policy won\u2019t work any way in the rapidly changing app development industry.\n\nPlaying defensive will only creates an impression that you have failed to understand their viewpoint and this could land you into more troublesome area. This could hamper the relationship with your app user who would never return back yet again. Therefore, you have to respond to the negative comments very carefully and intelligently.\n\nIf the customer has a bad user experience, it would be best to solve the problem on a personal note i.e. address their issue outside the app store. You can interact with your customers through various mediums such as online live chat, or reach them out through email.\n\nThe conversations should be private with one to one basis. Make your conversation short and to the point.\n\nIt\u2019s not that your app has got only negative reviews; there are some positive ones as well. So, you should try to take the advantage from that by copying and pasting it into the description. Once you highlight the positive comments, the users will get impression that your app is reliable and handy.\n\nWhen you get to know about an error or a bug in the app, you should go with a prompt response and thank the user for bringing it into your notice. The next step is quickly fixing the bug or the problem area within the shortest possible time.\n\nThis will give you less opportunities of receiving the negative response from the customer. Once you fixed the bug and tested the app, you should notify about the same through push notifications. You can request the user to review your app again with a polite approach.\n\nThere are two focal points in an effective communication; the first is the speaker and the second is the listener. Learn to become a good and patient listener.\n\nYou should first clearly listen to all the problems of the user without any interruption and try to analyze which part of app is creating the trouble. It helps in finding the issues quickly and fixing it in apt time.\n\nEven the negative reviews are constructive. This means that there are customers who are not just bothered about criticizing the app, but also offer valuable suggestions to improve it.\n\nWell, this should be welcomed. For instance, the user might ask you to add some more features and functionalities into app.\n\nWell, to tell you the truth that the Launching a Cost Per Engagement (CPE) Campaign could prove to be quite effective to boost your reviews. It is a type of campaign in which you pay only for those users who install your app and send a comment for it. Therefore, you pay for those users who are loyal to your app.\n\nIt is not possible to develop a perfect app with no issue at all. So, if you take the preventive measure before facing the music from users, it would be noteworthy.\n\nYou can always provide the useful and major troubleshooting tips, adding them into description so that the customer can first try to resolve the problem on his own. It should include your full contact details and email address.\n\nAs said even the negatives have the positive side into it. It is how you look into it. Every customer is valuable and you should thank them for taking out time to write a review for your app.\n\nAs said before most of the customers do not even care to comment on app and leave unnoticeably. You should always think that it is a tool using which you are further strengthening the relationship with the customer. In fact, see it as a good learning curve or experience.\n\nAlthough it has been suggested to remain calm and composed, but if someone is unnecessarily getting into your nerves, it\u2019s time to give them a befitting reply. Nobody has the right to damage your brand image if you come across any false allegation against your app, reply it with cool head providing substantial evidence that is visible to the entire community. Once everything is sorted out, inform everyone that it is on the right track.\n\nThis is a universal fact that coming across a negative review is like swallowing a bitter capsule, but it also helps in improving the health. So, you have to take the negative reviews for your app just like that.\n\nDon\u2019t get disheartened but instead draw the positives from it. Try to analyze the problem from the root and think what it makes your user unhappy. Solve the problem in quick time and always welcome the suggestions from the customers. This is how you can actually deal with the negative review of your app successfully.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the \ud83d\udc4f button and share to help others find it!"

It\u2019s been said there is no supplement for experience.\n\nFrom the time we\u2019re toddlers to our last dying breath, much of life is centered around the acquisition of knowledge. Sacrifice after sacrifice is made in contribution to the all-out assault known as surmounting our own ignorance.\n\nAs a life-long learner, I have been in this seat before. What I failed to realize however, is the experience or information gathered isn\u2019t the most important element.\n\nIt\u2019s the context in which the learning takes place.\n\nMichael Jordan, a man who needs no contextual introduction, studied game film an interesting way. His sessions were not focused on looking at what went right or what went wrong.\n\nHis focus was on what was missing.\n\nHe was looking for what could be inserted into his repertoire that would push his game over the edge. Mistakes were certainly recognized and calibrated, but what made the real difference was he wasn\u2019t quick to take anything away. He wasn\u2019t looking at limiting himself. The mistakes were a result of what was missing, not what was wrong."

        "text": "Social media marketing was great back in the day. But times have changed since 2010.\n\nIt was easy to get page \u201clikes,\u201d drive traffic, generate quality leads, and get conversions by publishing a few posts on social media.\n\nHowever, the space quickly became immensely competitive and noisy, making it more difficult than ever to get results.\n\nNew social media platforms emerged. The attention of audiences was further divided. And commanding a strong presence on social media became increasingly difficult.\n\nAnd then something horrendous happened.\n\nThe organic reach and associated engagement on social media started plummeting.\n\nPublishers using Facebook have been witnessing a constant decline in their organic reach for years now.\n\nIn fact, The Chicago Tribune reported having witnessed a significant decline in their Facebook post reach in January 2017.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all. It gets worse.\n\nInstagram completely disrupted their chronological order of displaying content in your feed. They replaced it with an algorithm that focuses on showing the content you\u2019re most likely to be interested in.\n\nAs you can imagine, it turned out to be a nightmare for brands because it became increasingly difficult to get visibility.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Facebook recently announced the biggest update to their newsfeed algorithm \u2014 \u201cZero Update.\u201d This algorithm change has made organic reach and engagement tougher than ever for brands and marketers.\n\nOkay, so here\u2019s the brutal truth.\n\nThis is happening. It was always going to happen. And it\u2019s going to keep happening.\n\nWhy? Because social media sites have discovered the profitability of advertising. And they\u2019re rapidly turning into paid marketing platforms.\n\nDoes that mean there\u2019s no way for marketers to continue to reach and engage their audiences organically?\n\nYou still have Facebook Live and Instagram Stories at your disposal. Incorporating these into your marketing mix can help you reach and engage your audiences organically and effectively.\n\nSoon after its launch in April 2016, Facebook Live became a valuable tool for media companies and brands. In fact, search interest for \u201cFacebook Live Stream\u201d has increased over 330% since the official announcement of Facebook Live.\n\nFacebook Live has changed the way users perceive and interact with videos opening up a window of opportunities for publishers.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that people watch Facebook Live videos 3 times longer than pre-recorded videos.\n\nThis signifies that Facebook Live can help boost your organic reach as well. In fact, the Head of News Feed at Facebook, Adam Mosseri, revealed in a blog post that live videos will continue to show up higher in News Feeds even after Facebook Zero is rolled out completely.\n\nIn an experiment, Socialbakers found that live videos outperformed all other content on Facebook.\n\nHere\u2019s an example that shows how Facebook Live videos drove 300% more organic reach and engagement.\n\nWishpond put Facebook Live to test against other content types to see the impact on engagement and organic reach.\n\nHere\u2019s how Wishpond\u2019s live videos fared against other types of posts on Facebook.\n\nTypically, Wishpond\u2019s Facebook posts used to reach an average of 374 people. However, this time, their Facebook Live video reached 300% more people than usual.\n\nReach isn\u2019t the only thing that Facebook Live videos are good for. They can also drive immense engagement for brands and publishers.\n\nFacebook Live videos can generate an average of 6X greater interactions than regular videos. In fact, Buzzsumo recently conducted a study on Facebook video content. They found that around 25% of all interactions on Facebook Live videos are comments.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example of how Smirnoff increased brand engagement with Facebook Live.\n\nSmirnoff ran a social media contest asking fans and followers to post a selfie. The company used the winning entries to create cocktails and the activity was streamed live on Facebook.\n\nThe results of the contest were outstanding. Smirnoff was able to amass over 600 selfie entries and thousands of votes. The live video generated 2.8 million impressions and 239,000 views by audiences. It also reached 451,000 people and generated 46,000 interactions.\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you realize the kind of impact Facebook Live videos are capable of.\n\nBut before you start leveraging them for your business, let me show you how you can multiply this impact many times over.\n\nHow? By including Facebook Live as part of your influencer marketing strategy.\n\nHere\u2019s how Best Fiends was able to maximize their organic reach and engagement using Facebook Live and influencer marketing.\n\nBest Fiends was looking for ways to drive awareness and boost the number of app downloads. So, they collaborated with Laura Clery, an influencer having more than 3 million followers on Facebook. In the live video for Best Fiends, Laura showed her audiences how to play the game.\n\nThis campaign turned out to be a clear winner. The video earned 8,300 likes, 464,000 views and 9,000 comments. Users were quick to respond and more than 13 comments were received every second. Not only did this help in increasing brand awareness but also the overall perception of the brand.\n\nHere are a few things that you must keep in mind when using Facebook Live videos in your marketing strategy.\n\nFacebook Live integrated with a well-thought-out influencer marketing strategy can help you easily boost your organic reach and engagement.\n\nYou might already know that Instagram has the highest number of users after Facebook with 800 millionmonthly active users.\n\nAnd 60% of Instagram users in a survey said that they visit the platform daily.\n\nNo wonder why more than 25 million businesses are using Instagram for advertising and building brand awareness.\n\nHowever, ever since Instagram changed to their algorithm in 2016, the organic reach on the platform has been steadily declining.\n\nFortunately for advertisers, Instagram Stories were introduced, which turned out to be a game changer.\n\nInstagram Stories quickly became immensely popular among users, content creators, and businesses alike. Launched on August 2, 2016, Instagram Stories now has over 300 million people using it on a daily basis.\n\nInstagram Stories have revolutionized the way users engage with branded content on the platform. People spend an average of 28 minutes on Instagram Stories every day. Those aged below 25 years spend more than 32 minutes daily on Instagram. And those over 25 years spend more than 24 minutes every day on the platform.\n\nInstagram can help you reach relevant audiences and engage them easily and effectively. For example, Renault wanted to promote their new model of Twingo Midnight among millennials. So, they leveraged Instagram Stories for a month long campaign.\n\nThe results included a 9-point increase in ad recall, a 3-point increase in awareness, and a 4-point increase in favorability among millennials.\n\nNow here\u2019s the big question. How can you expand your reach on Instagram and boost engagement without having to spend millions on expensive ads? By leveraging the power of influencers, of course.\n\nIn fact, 59% of micro-influencers found Instagram to be the best social media platform for engaging their audiences. Even for marketers, Instagram is the top choice with over 90% of them using the platform for influencer marketing.\n\nYoufoodz partnered with several Instagram influencers recently for an interesting campaign. Their goal was to create awareness about the launch of their new winter menu. So, they collaborated with influencers in fitness, food, and health niches to get their message across.\n\nThe campaign involved 167 pieces of content and more than 162 Instagram Stories. The results were nothing short of impressive. More than 500K impressions, over 69K engagement, and more than 1.45 million reach on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when using Instagram Stories.\n\nIn order to track and measure the performance of your Instagram Stories, make a note of the following metrics.\n\nIn addition to the benefits listed above, one of the top advantages of Facebook Live and Instagram Stories is how they help collect valuable audience data. You can create a custom audience based on video views to reach the people who are the most likely to engage with your brand content.\n\nYour video viewers (both on Facebook Live and Instagram Stories) have already engaged with your content. So there\u2019s a good chance that they will continue to engage with the content you deliver. You can target this audience in your remarketing campaigns to drive higher engagement.\n\nYou can further extend this strategy by collaborating with third-party content creators (influencers). Gain access to the third-party audience data using tools like Lumanu and then remarket your brand and products to this audience.\n\nFacebook Live and Instagram Stories are perhaps the best forms of content to engage your audiences. They allow you to humanize your brand and connect with your target audiences through authentic storytelling. So go ahead and leverage them to boost your organic reach and amplify user engagement around your brand.\n\nHave you used Facebook Live or Instagram Stories for your marketing?

        "text": "How To Take 100% Responsibility For Your Life Even If You Feel Hopeless\n\nWhen we were kids, we needed permission from parents, teachers and other elders.\n\nWhen we grow up, we seek permission from our bosses and authorities.\n\nYour mind is conditioned to ask for permission. But to unlock your full potential, you must give yourself permission to become the owner of your life.\n\nWhen you take complete ownership of your life, you are in charge of your life experiences. There is no space for blame or excuses.\n\nI\u2019m here to remind you the permissions you must give yourself.\n\nSome people are afraid of success. Some people think that being successful means making a lot of money or being greedy. Such mental programming has to leave your mind.\n\nSuccess is subjective. You have the power to define your own criteria for success. It could be being a good husband or wife, having a smile at the end of the day, having the freedom to travel the world or taking small steps towards your goal.\n\nNo matter what success means to you, you must own it and live up to it. Forget about what society\u2019s definition of success is. Write your own definition and move in its direction.\n\nTo make success a habit, set more behavior-based goals instead of outcome-based goals. For example, if you want to lose weight, define success by making the right food choice instead of the number on the weight scale. If you keep succeeding at the behavior-based goals and move in the right direction, the outcome will follow.\n\nBy default, life has no meaning. But if you strive for greatness, you can give your life a purpose.\n\nFailure is not a prerequisite for success but it amplifies the success. By making mistakes, you not only learn, but you build a character that transforms every other area of your life. Your mindset changes. You embrace success more because of the effort you put in.\n\nIf you let go of the fear of failure, you will not be afraid to explore the possibilities of your life. You will become limitless because you know that making mistakes speeds up your learning and results in growth.\n\nAll the newsflash, magazines, social media feeds show us the faces of successful people. It seems like they are the perfect people living a perfect life with zero flaws. But in reality, they are like you and me. They just keep on learning from failures.\n\nIn the world where success is preached, don\u2019t be afraid to look like a fool. Failure is not a scar on your self-esteem. It\u2019s a battle scar you can be proud of.\n\nWhen we fake our identity, we try to live up to the fake version we show to the world.\n\nIt\u2019s stressful to live up to people\u2019s expectation of who they think you are. On the other hand, if you be yourself, the right people will attract in your life and you won\u2019t have to put energy into showing a fake version of you.\n\nThe reason why we put on a mask is that it is our instinct to get accepted in communities. We could only survive if we were part of a group. The outcasts were rejected and they could not live long.\n\nBut today, when you have access to so many people, you don\u2019t have to fear people\u2019s rejection. You will always find like-minded people if you express yourself as you are.\n\nLet go of all the emotional baggage. Forgive yourself and move on. All you have is today. You get to define your future and it can only be great if you stop hurting yourself with the pain of the past.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to change. Raise your standards and if you have to, let go of your past identity and change the people around you.\n\nLearn to say no to the people or experiences that do not to appeal you. Life is too short to be inauthentic.\n\nYou deserve to be happy now.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to wait for the next paycheck, vacation or a soulmate to be happy. So often, we spend our lives thinking about the time in future when we will be happy.\n\nEven after getting what we want, we get hedonically adapted to the gifts in our life. It\u2019s okay to desire more success but first, you must learn to be happy with what you have.\n\nHappiness is a skill. If you can\u2019t be happy today, you won\u2019t be happy tomorrow. To develop the happiness skill, practice gratitude and mindfulness.\n\nCreate a bucket list of the life experiences you want to have and live those experiences. Nobody else will give you the permission to live your life the way you want.\n\nAnother way to be happy is to help others. Kindness not only makes the world a better place, it lets you see past the problems you have in life.\n\nNo matter how much you try to avoid the negative emotions like anger, frustration, sadness, jealousy, etc., you will feel them sometimes in your life.\n\nIt\u2019s in nature of humans to feel emotions. Instead of resisting such emotions, just observe when they arrive. When you acknowledge them and treat them as a guest, they will leave sooner than you expect them to stay in your mind.\n\nEmotions are beautiful. They help us to deal with hard situations. Become aware of your emotions and soon you will return to your default positive state if you practice the skill of being a happy person.\n\nDon\u2019t let negative emotions define you. Identify yourself as a happy person and treat negative emotions as something you feel temporarily."

        "text": "Recently I have gone through what can only be described as the laborious still paper-based process of buying a house. So I got to thinking there must be a quicker, more secure way of completing the process. One that makes the use of the technology available today.\n\nAs a first time buyer, I was blind, I never really had any idea what part of the process I was at, how long was left, all compounded by the vague answers from my solicitors. It seemed like I was waiting around for the endless packs to come through the post, sign and send back.\n\nIt seemed like this whole process could be digitalised. So I got my thinking hat on and started working on a new solution, one for the modern-day marketplace.\n\nA place for all parties involved to communicate over? A portal where buyers/sellers can have a clear overview of their part in the process, with the next steps laid out for them. No hidden fees, no guessing games. Just clear concise information.\n\nWith their offer accepted, Buyers have the ability to start the process by applying for and comparing a range of mortgage offers all from within the dashboard.\n\nWith the mortgage secured, the dashboard becomes the central hub for the buyer. Straight away the buyer has the ability to start on the paperwork supplied by the solicitor. No more waiting for a pack to come through the post, all accessible, all the time, from any device.\n\nWith the documents now digitised, the progression is clear. With each document that is successfully completed via digital signatures, the percentage of the progression bar increases. Buyers are left with a clear overview of how far they are through the progress, whilst being shown the documents that need to be completed next.\n\nFor the solicitors or estate agents, the portal becomes an easy to manage overview of all their properties. No large paper trails, instead one clear picture.\n\nOne of the main gripes I had with the whole process was the ability to get hold of my solicitor. Often I would be met with the response:\n\nIt sometimes felt like I had to precisely time my call to get any success. \n\nBut what if there was a more convenient way to get what is often functional information? People are looking to interact with people less and less when trying to find out purely functional information. Most often we just want to receive the information in the quickest way possible.\n\nOften I felt that most of my queries needed a small answer and a chatbot would have instantly solved this, leaving me as the buyer satisfied and the solicitor uninterrupted. Leaving only serious queries to be escalated to a phone call.\n\nWhat if we can leverage emerging technologies to help not only speed up the process, but also make it virtually risk free from mistakes or fraud?\n\nA blockchain essentially consists of records (\u201cblocks\u201d) that are inextricably linked and secured (into the \u201cchain\u201d) using cryptography (think bitcoin or ethereum). These records then exist via a ledger system that creates an open-source, decentralised place for exchanging all types of information and transfers of value.\n\nUsing blockchain for this process allows us to use what is known as smart contracts, which is a set of digital protocols that can run a series of commands set out in a contract. The protocols use a series of complex functions, which even allow aspects of a contract to be made partly or fully self-executing when specific conditions are met. For example the transferring of titles can be automated, instead of waiting for a solicitors to manually transfer details. Meaning a quicker process and stopping any potential for human errors or even fraud.\n\nSmart contracts have what is referred to as \u201ctriple entry bookkeeping\u201d, written in software code effectively form part of a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation.\n\nOr a DAO for short, it\u2019s where decisions are made electronically by a written computer code or through the vote of its members. In essence it is a system of hard coded rules that define which actions an organisation will take.\n\nSo, once a transaction is agreed, it is sent to the public ledger that I mentioned before, which operates on a open sourced basis via multiple servers known as nodes.\n\nEach transaction within the network has its own unique digital ID \u201cblock\u201d after all information related to transferring the title, deed and associated contracts are validated. Once this process is complete, the data \u201cblocks\u201d are permanently placed onto the \u201cchain\u201d and the transaction is complete.\n\nLeaving all parties with a unforgeable, time-stamped digital signature, meaning the integrity of the transaction is guaranteed, an immutable ledger of sorts. Where all the deeds, mortgage information, property records are stored and accessible much quicker, but more importantly, securely.\n\nAnd with your house purchase complete, now I will remove my thinking hat for today.

        "text": "You\u2019ve heard of businesses having a BHG or \u201cBig Hairy Goal.\u201d But what about a BHP?\n\nOne of the most common mistakes that runs businesses into the ground is trying to accomplish too many things at once. Even great systems fail when they\u2019re overloaded.\n\nAt JotForm we focus on one single Big Hairy Project at a time.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about unrealistic, short-sighted, and dangerous goals that burn out your employees and leave you feeling empty and adrift.\n\nI\u2019m talking about those game-changing, make-or-break projects that set you apart. They\u2019re why in 2017 we spent 326 days on our most user-driven BHP ever \u2014 JotForm Cards.\n\nWe thought about what forms might look like a decade from now. We performed multiple week-long hackathons. We went back to the drawing board more than once.\n\nWe were able to pull this off because of the systems that we\u2019d baked into our culture over the years; including Demo Days, regular releases, and other tactics I\u2019ll get into later.\n\nEspecially when you\u2019re just starting out, focusing on one project at a time allows you to develop systems to complete it successfully. And once that good habit is in place, it will carry over to future projects.\n\nThinking about one thing at a time instead of everything all the time will also increase your ability to make well-informed, project-oriented decisions.\n\nWe know that constraints breed creativity. A well-defined BHP can cut down on rework and help align people.\n\nAt JotForm, I usually give myself three months to choose our Big Hairy Project.\n\nDuring those three months, I discuss possible BHPs with our team, interview our users, run option analysis, and give my thoughts time to crystalize until the best contender becomes obvious.\n\nOnce we decide on a BHP, it\u2019s time to figure out what milestones will get us there in a year\u2019s time.\n\nThe systems that we already have in place work for us as a team instead of being tied to specific outcomes. I feel comfortable knowing that when we follow them, they will help us achieve the results we want \u2014 no matter how different those might be from years past.\n\nI regularly have to shoot down great ideas simply because they don\u2019t align with the BHP.\n\nAt times it\u2019s tough to be ruthless, but I stick to this system because it\u2019s one that has led me through many business breakthroughs since I started JotForm as a side gig over 12 years ago.\n\nWe have a habit of releasing an update to JotForm every single day.\n\nThis is one of the systems that makes it possible to keep a team of over 100 employees in different parts of the world all working toward the same BHP.\n\nAnd not only does it prove to our users that we care about making our product better for them, it forces us to stay out of the weeds and focus on what we should be doing instead of what we could be doing.\n\nShipping every day gives us tons of chances to conduct A/B testing. We can quickly see what users love and what they wish we would just leave the heck alone.\n\nThis iterative, agile system reflects the way we operate as a business, too.\n\nInstead of locking our engineers in a dark room for six months and just hoping users like what we spit out, we\u2019re finding out what they like and don\u2019t like on a regular basis.\n\nOne of the most satisfying aspects of daily releases is that after a few months, we\u2019ve suddenly built a whole new product or feature.\n\nThere\u2019s no disappointment that we didn\u2019t hit an arbitrary launch date, we don\u2019t spend months on quality assurance testing, and we don\u2019t suffer from anticlimactic adoption rates when it turns out our customers don\u2019t actually like what we\u2019ve been working on.\n\nOur shipping system protects us against the business challenges other software companies regularly struggle with.\n\nEvery once in a while, the whole JotForm team spills from their offices at the same time. They gather in a single room. The air crackles with energy.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the Hunger Games. It\u2019s Demo Day.\n\nRichard Feynman is credited for developing the concept that if you can\u2019t explain something simply, you don\u2019t fully understand it.\n\nDemo days give us the opportunity of explaining what we\u2019re working on to a room full of diverse people is an excellent opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of 1) what we\u2019re doing, 2) why it matters, and 3) how each team has an integral role in our overall success.\n\nDemo Days do more than provide a fun excuse to knock off work and talk about our wins, they also provide a chance to really practice some of the building blocks of our company culture: transparency, accountability, and autonomy.\n\nThe JotForm leadership team also takes this chance to check the pulse of progress and enthusiasm toward the BHP. We can provide course correction without breathing down anyone\u2019s neck."

        "text": "You could be successful in any task you pursue only if bad habits don\u2019t often interfere in the process. Eating healthy, being productive, producing quality outputs \u2014 they are all possible.\n\nThe only thing is that bad habits keep stealing your valuable energy. They attract you to give in to them. You try to resist them but most of the time, you succumb to them.\n\nHabits are the brain\u2019s way of helping us by establishing a pattern that neurons can follow. They put us on autopilot. They can be your servants or masters.\n\nMost people choose the latter by fostering the bad ones. They devote more time in front of their smartphones or TV screens instead of doing their work. They stress out during submissions because they can\u2019t break their procrastination. They struggle with weight and health because they can\u2019t stop their bad eating habits.\n\nThey feel good when they do it but feel bad afterward. They promise to break the bad habit, but they cannot resist the temptation. They pledge to do it tomorrow until the idea disappears into the ether.\n\nThere is nothing to be embarrassed about when you have bad habits. Every person has. I know I have.\n\nIn the words of Benjamin Hardy, \u201cIf you cannot admit you have a problem, you\u2019re not ready to make the change. If you still don\u2019t believe you have a problem, then the negative consequences of your behavior haven\u2019t become real enough for you. If you continue going against your gut, eventually things will become so chaotic.\u201d\n\nBeing open to break bad habits puts you on the advantage against most people who deny them. You cannot change something if you can\u2019t accept that something has to change.\n\nSmall, bad behaviors when piled up can have a negative impact in the long run. Your bad habits can create a dent in your productivity.\n\nMany cannot accept that the results they are reaping today are the sum of what they repeatedly do. No wonder only a few benefit from the power of habits.\n\nHabits are difficult to change because they are already ingrained in your system. Doing things regularly condition your neurons to make the action automatic.\n\nThis is why your brain does not exert a conscious effort when you perform your morning regimen.\n\nBad habits are magnets that pull you away from your goals. They slow down your growth. Many people would like to stop them. Despite their best efforts, they are unable to change. Their habits take them to the direction they don\u2019t want.\n\nBad habits are difficult to break because they make a person feel good.\n\nDr. Russell Poldrack said that pleasure-based habits are harder to break. The brain releases a chemical dopamine when it experiences an enjoyable behavior. He said:\n\nPeople have different habits, and so the way to break them differs from person to person.\n\nIt takes a lot of trial-and-error before you can nail what works for you. There is no one-size fits all formula that everyone can apply. Research shows sixty-six days is the average time for a person to form a habit. It varies from 18 to 254 days for it to stick.\n\nHere are some science-backed ways that can help break your bad habits or at least minimize their existence:\n\nWhether devouring a pack of potato chips or procrastinating, you have one bad habit you want to bid goodbye.\n\nCharles Duhigg shared the \u201chabit loop\u201d concept in his best-selling book, Power of Habits. He explained that habit consists of three parts: a routine, a reward, and a cue.\n\nOnce you identify each part, you can tailor ways to combat or replace those habits.\n\nFirst is to pinpoint the behavior you want to change or your Routine. It\u2019s when you get your phone and scroll social media feed instead of doing what you must. It\u2019s when you take a long nap even though you need to finish something. It is when you grab a box of cookies when you have to eat salad instead.\n\nThis routine robs your time that can be devoted to tackling more important tasks. Recognizing the routine that impedes your improvement is a key to correcting it.\n\nNext is to identify the Reward that you get from the routine. It is what makes you repeat the activity. It is the pleasure you get from doing it.\n\nDuhigg said to test different hypotheses to find out what drives your craving. As you test, change some variables like the location, time or object involved in the habit.\n\nAfter each experience, write three words that you can associate with the activity.\n\nWhat makes you satisfied doing it?\n\nIs it the salty taste from the chips? the crunch? the texture?\n\nIs it the gossip from social media? the funny meme? the updates from friends?\n\nIs it the quietness from your nap? the softness of the bed? the smell of the room?\n\nWriting down the words can help you remember the thoughts involve in that experience. Once you have identified the reward, you can find another activity to replace it.\n\nThe Cue is what triggers the habitual behavior. Certain time, place, activity, emotion or people can trigger habits. Making a plan to avoid what triggers them can create a difference.\n\nMany people want to stop eating unhealthy chips, yet, they cannot stop from buying them. You can develop a principle \u201cout of sight, out of mind.\u201d When you don\u2019t see that craving, it is easier to ignore it. Limit your contact with it.\n\nTo find out the cue, Duhigg suggests writing five things when the urge hits.\n\nTo have a clear picture, identify the five categories: location, time, emotion, people and preceding action. Track down the activity for at least three days until you find the recurring pattern.\n\nIf your bad habit is being on your phone for a long time, study the cues involved.\n\nTime: Is it there a certain time of the day you do it?\n\nPeople: Are there people involved when you do it?\n\nEmotion: Are you agitated or bored that prompt you to pick your phone?\n\nPreceding Action: What did you do before you pick your phone? What action triggered you to pick it?\n\nLocation: Is there a part of the house where you always do it?\n\nOnce you identify your habit loop, brainstorm possible activities to replace that behavior. You can test by changing the cue that drives the habit."

        "text": "How To Make More Money As An Entrepreneur\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you might be too.\n\nBut before you get too offended\u2026stay with me and hear me out. I\u2019ve got a quick story to tell you.\n\nTwo months ago, I was close to having no money.\n\nThings were going relatively well with my new lead generation agency, and I had covered all of my costs with a couple grand to spare. But then, I ran into two huge problems that derailed my plans\u2026\n\nTwo out of the five clients I have, decided not to pay this month\u2019s worth of work. One is re branding, and the other is a CPA firm who was buried up to their necks in work and can\u2019t take care of a few asks on their end.\n\nEach of these companies has been with me for a few months and for the most part we\u2019ve got great relationships. But this month\u2019s payments have been postponed. There goes $3200 unexpectedly.\n\nSo for a few weeks afterwards I was all over them and freaking the f*** out trying to recoup my money. When that didn\u2019t work I decided to send out around 45 proposals to other companies looking for work and thought i\u2019d be able to make up the difference for the month\u2019s loss. That didn\u2019t work either.\n\nI was done for.\n\nSo for the next few days I spent waaay too much time in my own feelings and being sorry for myself.\n\nAt this stage in my company\u2019s development (only 7 months old), I can\u2019t afford to have $3000 gaps in revenue.\n\nBut about a month ago, as I was paying one of my contractors for their work, I came to a realization that changed everything around for the better.\n\nHere\u2019s what I realized, and then did, that you need to realize, to make more money as an entrepreneur.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Seems intuitive, but when I added up all the time I was spending on different things, selling came in 5th place.\n\nSo I immediately hopped on Upwork, did some consulting work for other companies, and quickly made back 80% of those fees that I lost out on this month.\n\nIn the early stages of a company (especially a small or service based start up), you need to focus a majority of your efforts on activities that will bring you revenue.\n\nHere are things that you think are important out of fear or subconcious procrastination:\n\nThe point is, that before you start worrying about all of the extraneous aspects of your business and making sure that you\u2019re in some mastermind Facebook group, limit the amount you spend, define your product or service, and start selling.\n\nYou should be dedicating about 60% of your efforts to selling, meetings, or prospecting at the start of a new business.\n\nIf you do that, you\u2019ll be less likely to get stuck in the trap of producing all of your own work and will have the money to hire correctly and scale.\n\nIn the beginning, you might feel the need to become a jack of all trades due to the insane amount of different responsibilities that comes with being an entrepreneur.\n\nYou have to be your own bookeeper, salesperson, copywriter, web designer, and many other things. Those are all to be expected to some degree but your offering should not follow along these same lines.\n\nIt might be tempting to cast a wide net in order to make the most money but this is a trap.\n\nA better alternative is to get specific from the very start. Master one thing and then move on to the next as demand calls for it.\n\nThere are many ways to niche down but typically the following are all great places to start:\n\nThe more specific you are in your offering, the more likely you\u2019ll be able to connect to a core group of potential customers or clients that will trust you becuase of your abilitiy to address their needs better than a generalist.\n\nStop working for pennies and doing basic s***.\n\nTake a moment to sit down and think critically about a way that you can uniquely solve someones problem. Figure out how you can combine your personality, product, service, and brand together in such a way that adds a ton of value to someone else\u2019 life.\n\nThen, give this a nice and respectable price tag. If you offer \u201cWordPress design services\u201d but your only experience is adding sound and bold tags to your old Myspace page, you\u2019re not going to be able to charge a premium.\n\nBut if you know how to customize Avada themes, and customize the admin dashboard so that businessess get the flexibility of WordPress without having to understand the technical aspects, now you get to charge a few thousand easily.\n\nThey\u2019ll happily reward you with more money.\n\nTo delegate, simply means to give a task or responsibility away and trust that it will get done.\n\nIf you want to scale your business and create sustainable and continual long term growth, then this is a non negotiable part of the operation. Without it, you can only physically sustain a certain level of work while maintaining quality.\n\nPicture some of the largest corporations in the world. Mcdonalds, Walmart, Amazon. One thing they all have in common? They compartmentalize tasks and delegate those tasks extremely well.\n\nThat\u2019s what has allowed them to grow at such a staggering rate (along with incredible leadership, vision, and logistics planning, but you get the point). If you want to achieve the same kind of growth with your company you\u2019re going to have to understand the following.\n\nWhen you\u2019re working IN your business instead of ON the business, you have a very narrow focus. You\u2019re so wrapped up in getting each task and to-do checked off of your list that you don\u2019t stop and assess your performance.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, working hard and getting things done is not an inherently bad thing. In fact, when your company is in it\u2019s infancy, you\u2019re going to be doing most of the work.\n\nBut at some point you\u2019re going to have to figure out ways to remove yourself from all of the repetitive or non essential tasks, take a step back, and look at where the ship is headed.\n\nDoes it make sense to try and bail out water from a boat that is about to crash into a large rock?\n\nThere will always be someone better than you. At everything. Forever.\n\nLet that sink in. Take a moment to sit with that thought and give yourself ample time to digest those words.\n\nYou cannot expect to run a company and be every job within the company as well. Yes, your talents and skills were the reason that it was able to get up and running, but they will not be the tools that allow it to reach future success.\n\nAs a founder, your primary job is to be great at gaining new business, creating systems, having vision for the future, and quality control. Everything else can quickly be given away to someone who is better than you.\n\nNow go change your business for the better."

        "title": "Top Crypto Credit Card For 2018 And Beyond \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Crypto-Marketplace Series: Learn Where & How you can spend Crypto\n\n(5 part series \u2014 PART 1)\n\nThe use of crypto as an alternative currency is growing fast. Crypto credit card is yet another addition to the crypto community that is set to cause a major ripple in the world of real-life spending. With the new invention, cryptocurrencies are now more than just investments assets, they can be used as an actual currency for purchasing commodities.\n\nIf you are not well versed with crypto cards yet, today is your lucky day. Shortly, we shall review some of the top crypto credit cards that you should keep an eye on.\n\nThink of it as just like any other debit card that you can use at an ATM or point of sale. The only difference here is that you draw from a cryptocurrency wallet instead of a bank account. So whenever you make a purchase using your crypto card, an amount of crypto coins you need is automatically exchanged for fiat currency, and sent to the merchant. Usually, the process is seamless and you won\u2019t even notice it.\n\nCurrently, and as you can see here, there are many crypto cards in existence. In this post we shall review a few popular cards. For each card we shall explore the technology behind it, fees, rewards and finally its availability.\n\nTechnology: TenX is one of the commonly talked about. It has the largest market cap, and it is the first player to launch a product to the market. The Tenx card is developed on the COMIT network- a multi-asset, off-chain routing protocol that enables instant transactions.\n\nFees: Tenx is affordable. To order a physical card you be required to pay $15. However, the virtual card (yet to be available) will be much cheaper. It will only cost you $1.50 to activate. Also, there is an annual fee of $10 per card if you spend less than $1000 in 12 months. Not to forget a fee of $2.50 for every ATM transaction you make.\n\nRewards: According to the Tenx reward scheme, users will receive a 1% reward (in form of PAY tokens) for every purchase. As a PAY token holder, you will receive a further 0.5% share of the total network\u2019s transaction volume, and this reward will be in Ethereum.\n\nAvailability: The Tenx card can be used in any country (out of the US) where VISA is accepted. Presently, the card supports Ethereum and Bitcoin payments. Dash and more ERC20 tokens will also be made available in Q2 of 2018.\n\nTechnology: Monaco has the second largest market cap after Tenx. Much of her technology is proprietary. Monaco is built on Ethereum, and it integrates a mobile app and Visa-branded payment processor.\n\nThe project offers four kinds of cards, each with unique features, rewards as well as fees. Depending on the card you choose, you will be required to hold on the following amounts of your MCO tokens for a period of 6 months: Midnight Blue (0 MCO), Ruby Steel (50 MCO), Precious Metal(500 MCO) and Obsidian Black(50,000 MCO).\n\nFees: As we noted above, fees vary from one card to the next. And there are no monthly or annual charges. However, each card will be charged 2% ATM fee if the monthly limit is exceeded. And the monthly limits vary from $200 for the Midnight Blue card to $1,000 for the Obsidian Black. Also, you will be required to pay a 1% fee every time you buy cryptocurrency.\n\nRewards: Just as the fees, rewards also vary from one card to the next. While there are not cash back rewards for Midnight Blues, the other cards; Precious Metal, Ruby Steel and Obsidian Black have rewards of 1.5%, 1% and 2% respectively. All cash back rewards are made in MCO tokens.\n\nAvailability: The Monaco cards are yet to be made available. The team is expected to launch the cards, first in Asia, Europe, and then North America. To begin with, the cards will support Monaco tokens, Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nTechnology: Centra comes a distant third in terms of the market cap. Centra uses a patent pending Currency Conversion Engine (CCE) component to enable exchanges between currencies. The other key module here is the Centrachain which executes smart contracts and aids in the creation of decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nJust like Monaco, Centra offers three different types of cards with varying limits, fees and rewards. Depending on the card you want, you will be required to buy the following quantities of CTR tokes: Centra Blue (50 CTR), Centra Gold (10,000 CTR) and Centra Black (100,000 CTR).\n\nFees: To start using your card, it will cost you $20 to activate it, and a subsequent $2.50 ATM charges for every withdrawal. There is also an annual fee in CTR for each card, and it ranges from $50 the Centra Blue to $500 for the Centra Black.\n\nRewards: For every card upgrade, users get higher rewards i.e. Centra Blue gives 0.2%, Centra Gold 0.5%, and Centra Black has 2.0% cash back rewards.\n\nAvailability: Currently, only those who bought the ICO possess the Centra cards. However, the Centra team states that more cards will be made available this year. Currencies presently supported by the card include; Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin, Centra, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash.\n\nTechnology: TokenCard will close our list for today. It is also built on the Ethereum network. Combining the wallet app and the card, Tokencard gives users full control over their funds. It gives users the ability to choose how they would want each purchase split among the different coins that they have.\n\nFees: The Tokencard team has not yet indicated whether there will be an initial fee to issue the card. They are also yet to reveal their annual fee structure.\n\nRewards: Both the Tokencard whitepaper as well as the website is silent on the cash back rewards.\n\nAvailability: While Tokencard is not available yet, it is clear that the team has thought through it. The project roadmap indicates that the card will be available in a couple of months\u2019 time. Currencies supported by the card include; Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.\n\nWhen compared to conventional ways of trading crypto for fiat currency at exchanges, Crypto credit cards will offer many benefits. They include:\n\nFreedom- You can spend your cryptocurrencies without having to worry about exchanges or exchange rates.\n\nUniversality-Similar to Visa and MasterCard, crypto cards are accepted almost everywhere. So you will not need to hunt for vendors who accept crypto.\n\nRewards- Unlike spending cash, most crypto cards offer reward schemes that you can actually benefit from.\n\nAll said and done, there is no doubt that merging crypto with debit cards is a powerful innovation for mainstream adoption. If you don\u2019t have a crypto credit card yet, the options discussed in this article can be a great start for you. Try one and share with us your experience."

        "title": "Entrepreneur of the year goes to the old man on the street in Istanbul",
        "text": "Yesterday, I was at Emononu, a ferry station in Istanbul and spotted one of the most entrepreneurial person that I have seen. I was blown away by his entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nThe Sultanahmet area in Istanbul is teeming with tourists and so if you are a tourist and have spent anywhere beyond a day or two, you get used to being approached by shop salesmen trying to entice you with their wares. I don\u2019t want you to get an impression that these guys are in your face and asking you to see something without an iota of originality in their sales pitches (a la a phone vendor in a typical US mall). Almost all of the guys have a super interesting hook to start a conversation with you and bring you into their shops.\n\nThese sales guys set a high bar \u2014 they nail the cold call opening!\n\nPerhaps the highest bar in selling was set by Ibrahim at the Tuncer Gift shop who by far has been amongst the best salesperson I have ever seen and I have worked with many. Ibrahim had a unique conversational style that differentiates him over everyone else. He differentiated himself as opposed to the goods while selling commodity goods through a shop. (See his TripAdvisor reviews). Perhaps, I need to write a blog about Ibrahim but I have digressed.\n\nNow coming back to street vendors, my default reaction to street vendors \u2014 typically guys carrying tea, chips or other such sundries is a terse no. That\u2019s just the way it is, I don\u2019t want to hear or even see what the vendor is offering. I presume this is the reaction of most folks when approached by street vendors.\n\nAnyways \u2014 so if I have painted the picture that between the high salesmanship standards by shop salesman, my general dislike to being approached by street vendors and the fact that this was my third day in Istanbul that it was a high bar for someone to standout.\n\nThen, we saw him and lets call him Abu (Urdu for father) an elderly gentleman, perhaps in his late 60s or early 70s, with a weather beaten face. Not the ones that look tired and indicate a life endured by hardship but a weather beaten face with an underlying glow backed with a smile that shows a life well lived and worked hard with honesty and integrity. He was wearing a suit and in the middle of 24C day, it must have been genuinely warm. The suit was worn down too.\n\nAbu had a canon camera around his neck and a a big bag slung over his shoulder.\n\nThe bag had a kodak photo printer hacked with a battery pack to provide power to the photo printer!\n\nAbu, thus had positioned himself next to the ferry station of the Bosphorus tour and was reaching out to tourists who were waiting for the next tour to start at the dock and getting them to take a picture. His unique selling point, was a hard copy of your photograph. Not a regular tea vendor \u2014 that wasn\u2019t for him.\n\nWhy did we give in and get a picture clicked?\n\nHe was framing the pictures in a photo frame and I (Mr. Customer) got a choice between two colours. Totally unexpected and completely delightful (delighters anybody?).\n\nThis is interesting in itself while we were waiting and not really looking at him. We saw him from the corner of our eyes, he had just finished taking a picture of a Russian family and then get this \u2014 he offered them a choice of white or a black paper frame to go along with the picture. The guy had thought about everything \u2014 amazing.\n\nWhen we saw the picture frame, my wife and me decided we have to take a picture from this enterprising human.\n\nHere is the picture that he took for us.\n\nNow, I typically will not pose for pictures and Abu made us pose right for a great picture and he did that every other customer that we saw. All in the 30 seconds that it took him to take the picture while not speaking a word of english. Amazing!\n\nI regret not taking his picture though :-(.\n\nSo Abu from my point of view has done everything right as a CEO of Abu, Inc.\n\nAll this for 4TL or about $1!\n\nI wonder how things could be so much different if he was in Silicon Valley \u2014 he could very well be running a successful company.\n\nBut then again, who says he is not successful?\n\nHe is the CEO of 1 with a highly successful product in a niche market that is completely dominated by him."

        "title": "7 TED Talks to Help You Overcome Your Fear of Failure",
        "text": "Do you want to overcome your fear of failure? Then don\u2019t just sit back and think about it, go out and conquer it! Tackling your fears will take you places where you could never have imaged before. Imagine how it feels like to do anything in the world without fear or any negative feelings.\n\nFear of failure is infused in us from our early childhood, and we are always told not to do this or avoid that. So after a while, we become cautious of things and instead of taking action, we seek permission and confirmation.\n\nAs we grow, this belief tends to become unconscious and automatic. We aren\u2019t aware of its presence, yet it commands us from the shadows, like an unseen puppet master.\n\nHowever, learning to fight with the fear of failure can be a challenging task for everyone, especially when you are determined to take your personal growth to the next level. Fortunately, all fears are learned. No one is born with fears. Therefore, fear can be unlearned by practicing self-discipline repeatedly about fear, until it goes away.\n\nThere is no mystical pill for this, and we don\u2019t have to become fearless. We just have to be willing enough to face our fears.\n\nFear itself is not a problem. You are allowed to worry and stress. It doesn\u2019t make you weak, and it does not represent you. But, if you really want to get to where you desire, you have to fight your fear.\n\nYou don\u2019t need confidence, only a little courage, and competence.\n\nSo, here are a few inspiring TED Talks to help you find some:\n\nTo state Tim Ferriss is a high-end achiever would be an understatement, but this doesn\u2019t mean he is immune from fear and failure. When he was young, he feared water. He avoided swimming for many years. In this inspiring TED talk, he shared how he overcame his fear, and how this experience encouraged him to re-examine the role it plays in learning.\n\nIt had put him on an incredible journey and the realization that \u201cfear is your friend.\u201d Fear is an indicator. Sometimes it shows you what you should not do. More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.\n\nBarbara Corcoran is not a stranger to failure anymore. In this TED talk, she explained to us how failure has played a remarkable role in her success and how she learned to enfold it by shoving her fears to one side.\n\nShe further added that \u201cour fear is something we have made up in our mind.\u201d And, we can easily redefine and re-imagine what it means to us.\n\nTherefore, just like Barbara Corcoran, you may find your real successes come on the heels of failure.\n\nPublic speaking is a common fear many people experience. But, Jonathan Fields believe that this fear often fades away with time and once you start and get into your groove.\n\nToday, Jonathan Fields is a bestselling author who loves to work with creative people to build more meaningful and connected lives.\n\nBut in this TED talk, Fields rolls into how he allowed his fear to stay with him for many years and make him suffer before he turned his fear into the fuel to generate his best work ever.\n\n4. \u2018What I Learned From 100 Days of Rejection\u2019 by Jia Jiang\n\nIn this fascinating TED Talk, Jia Jiang describes an embarrassing moment from the time he was young.\n\nHe says it\u2019s easy to explain why he cultivated fear of rejection later in life. He had dreams and aspirations, but laid these to one side for a long time, opting for the more natural possibility, instead.\n\nWell, this is what that drove to his adventure into\u201drejection\u201d and the community that helps people overcome their fears of rejection so that they can fulfill their dreams with a blink of an eye.\n\n\u201cFear is something that affects us all\u201d\n\nHe further concluded that when you face rejection, you are going to face the next obstacle or next failure. So, consider the possibilities and don\u2019t run. If you simply embrace them, they might become gifts as well.\n\n5. \u2018Why You Have To Fail To Have A Great Career\u2019 by Michael Litt\n\nMichael Litt believes that \u201cfailure yields the ultimate experience needed for success.\u201d\n\nMost people dream about overnight success, and maybe they admire someone who started their business or career with a bang. But, the truth is, most successful people sneak into success, improving slowly over time since they make one mistake after another.\n\nHe explained this further in such a beautiful way;\n\n\u201cYou should fail to have a great career unless you fail to have a great career.\u201d\n\nAnd, at present, he is living proof of this, establishing and growing \u201cVidyard\u201d into a company that\u2019s transforming how brands connect in the digital age \u2014 but only after a lot of trial and error methods.\n\n6. \u2018Embrace The Near Win\u2019 by Sarah Lewis\n\nSara Lewis is a renowned art curator who years of experience working with world\u2019s biggest artists and galleries. She has had the privilege to learn how creative people work and how they form successful careers.\n\nAnd, in this Ted Talk, she shared one of these invaluable lessons and how she has learned to embrace the \u201cnear win.\u201d\n\nShe narrates us how success is a moment and how successful people always strive for more.\n\nSara believes that \u201cpursuit is in the mastery\u201d and making progress one by one.\n\nEvery new win pushes you harder, meaning your fear of failure is not only powerless but has a direct influence on the progress you make today.\n\nRichard St. John is the bestselling author of the book \u201cThe 8 Traits Successful People Have in Common\u201d In this TED talk, he explains to us why people reach success but then only to fail.\n\nAccording to him, with the fear of failure, many people fear for success as well.\n\nFurther, he added success is not a one-way road where you have to do everything that leads up to success and then you reach there. The irony is when we figure we have made it, we stay in our comfort zones, and we actually stop doing the things that made us successful in the first place.\n\nAsk yourself and you will get the answers. Learn to listen and trust your inner voice. Overcoming your fear is as hard as you make it. The moment you face your fears, you realize that they are not as bad as you thought they would be.\n\nSo, what will it be?\n\nFollow your passions despite your fears. You would surely be living the life you have always desired. You would not have to look back at your life with regret. Therefore, to live a regret-free life, you have to be willing to make mistakes. Throw some color at the canvas and see what happens. Live life for you, not for anyone else.\n\nThis is your experience. Enjoy the ride."

        "title": "How to Use Facebook as a Marketing Strategy For Your Startup",
        "text": "Out of the many things that Facebook can do, it has the impeccable power of shaping your startup and providing a huge platform to reach out to its customers. Startups are constantly using the features of Facebook to engage their customers and implement in their content strategies in the unique ways.\n\nDo you want to use this most popular social media platform as a marketing strategy for your startup or business?\n\nVideos are undeniably the hottest trend of present times. The first thing that you most often come across on the social media platform is videos. There are various reasons why the popularity of videos has grown to strikingly unprecedented levels on social media platforms.\n\nThe content around us is evolving more and more with each day and can be credited to the changing preferences of people. The long written blogs and other stories are being converted to short videos and video stories.\n\nTo understand why people prefer videos more than anything else, ask yourself if you were given a long paragraph to read and a video, what would you choose? Videos are always more engaging than written content.\n\nIt has the power to instantly connect with people and touch their emotional self in a more compelling manner. Videos are the relatable and much easier way of grasping things. More and more companies these days are using video as a marketing tool.\n\nSo, it doesn't matter if it is a product launch or a DIY tutorial, or an advertisement, videos are one of the best ways of engaging the customers. Facebook is providing a wonderful platform for videos to flourish and shape businesses in the coming years.\n\nOne of the most advantageous and unique features of Facebook is Live Marketing. Live Marketing has helped businesses and startups attain an upper hand in the market and stand out with their strategies.\n\nAs intimidating as live marketing on Facebook sounds, it\u2019s equally tricky and challenging to accomplish. If done the right way, it can do wonders for a business and shape their strategies towards unconditional support from their customers.\n\nFacebook\u2019s algorithm uses over 100,000 different signs to decide which posts should be prioritized on the customer\u2019s feeds. So, no matter how great the content you produce is, there is a strong chance that your content will get overshadowed by the unlimited posts from friends and family.\n\nSo, if you want your message to be heard, one of the best ways is to go LIVE on Facebook. The live feature from Facebook instantly provides a free pass to the business and enables them by reaching in front of the queue to speak directly to the customer.\n\nAs you go live, all those following you receive an instant notification to connect with you. While going live is facilitating Facebook to get more and more customers hooked on to their sites, it is also enabling companies to catch their customer\u2019s attention. You can stream a lot of things live on Facebook. These can be seminars, any discussions, interviews, or events. Think of ways to go Live and embrace this great feature.\n\nAnother way that startups are shaping their strategies on Facebook is through their own customers. It\u2019s always a great idea for customers to interact with your business so that you get some buzz in the market. You can ask your happy customers to create content for you. This tactic will help rush the engagement and accelerate more attention towards your business page.\n\nLet people talk about you more and more and letting Facebook know that there is a constant buzz around your brand. Driving engagement with the audience is a successful social media strategy that has a life of its own.\n\nOne of the most basic examples are the meme pages on Facebook. They let their audience post memes, which is the core content in their case, and circulate them to the rest of the world.\n\nYou can come up with contests which require posting photos and videos online. If you are a food brand, you can ask your customers to post pictures of a recipe that they tried at home, or video of a new recipe. This will draw a great engagement to your brand and help you gain your audience\u2019s attention.\n\nPaid advertising is one of the keys to achieve your objectives. It\u2019s important to understand that while paid advertising might not work for everyone, it ultimately comes down to the ROI of your strategy.\n\nPaid advertising is quite inexpensive, as compared to other advertising channels and platforms in the market. It can help you get a number of potential leads, and most importantly attention among your target customers.\n\nFacebook allows you to start a discussion to engage people and leave them with something to talk about your brand. There are some ways that you can initiate discussions, such as polls, quizzes, reviews, etc. Through these tactics, Facebook can help your startup get your customer\u2019s attention and understand their personas for forming better marketing strategies.\n\nCustomer personas revolve around knowing the habits, likes, dislikes, age, preferences etc. of the customer. Through the discussion, you can get to know your customer and customize your content based on their likes.\n\nTHANK YOU for listening this story.

        "text": "Coffee is known to keep us awake and alert. This is the nectar of life for hustlers and go-getters.\n\nMy love for coffee started during college. My mom bought me a brewing machine and this became part of my morning ritual. Weighing the beans, pouring water, and waiting for my fresh cup of coffee. I would then add a bit of milk and go on my way to class. I would open my tumbler and let the aroma keep my classmates sneer in envy.\n\nCoffee has saved me and I continue to find ways to love it even more. Coffee was there when I took my board exam as an engineer. And it maintained its constant presence during my working life.\n\nI am re-reading the book Millionaire Fastlane by MJ De Marco. I first read this book after graduating college, the same year I discovered the Four Hour Work Week \u2014 both books have scammy titles. But they became seminal into how I perceived wealth creation and building businesses.\n\nMJ De Marco says that people who have built massive wealth have a different perspective from those who are still on the Slowlane grind.\n\nSlowlane, the people who are still on their day jobs saving up 10% of their salary for mutual funds, have the consumer mindset. When something catches their fancy, they think of ways on how they can buy it. Should they work over time? Ask for a pay raise?\n\nFastlane people think about producing it. How can I create it? How do they profit from this? What is the distribution model?\n\nI want to apply this mindset to my obsession with coffee. Starbucks has made so much money from coffee. Creating your coffee will help you appreciate your next cafe latte from your local barista.\n\nHere are a couple of ways to create a perfect cup in the morning.\n\nThis is the cheapest and easiest way to brew your morning coffee. This is manual brewing and doesn\u2019t need electricity. You have the option to buy a cheap glass variation or stainless steel.\n\nCoffee is made through immersion. This is the same concept as brewing your tea.\n\nYou pour 10 grams of coffee grinds in your french press and then pour 180 grams of water. You wait for four minutes and thirty seconds then you plunge the filter.\n\nPour your coffee and enjoy your breakfast.\n\nThere are myriad of recipes online, a thousand of variations of the ratio of coffee to water. And ways to make your first bloom and then time to pour.\n\nBut this is as simple as it can get.\n\nMy younger brother introduced me to cold brew coffee. I saw him one afternoon taking out a massive jar of coffee from the fridge.\n\nI was flabbergasted. I haven\u2019t heard of such thing. What is this magic?\n\nHe gave me a sip and I fell in love.\n\nWhen I looked it up on the internet, this is not some new invention. This variation has existed for years. This has spawned a crave that some cafes only serve cold brew.\n\nThis type of brew is less acidic and perfect for those who have acid reflux.\n\nThis is 90% same as the method above. The only difference is that you use room temperature water and you wait for 12\u201324 hours.\n\nThe coffee to water ratio differs. For my recipe, I use 80 grams of coffee to 560 grams of water and I brew it for 24 hours.\n\nThis results in stronger coffee so I mix it with one part water to tone it down to regular taste. Adjust to your liking.\n\nI have yet to try this method. This is another cheap way to make your brewed coffee. The favorite techniques I\u2019ve seen are the Hario V60 and the Chemex.\n\nInstead of immersing beans, you let water pass by the beans in a shorter span of time.\n\nThe paper filters weed out the coffee oils resulting in a smoother blend compared to a French Press. Lots of people swear by this method and I should get my hands into one of this apparatus.\n\nThis is the heart of all the drinks you buy in your local cafe \u2014 latte, flat white, cappuccino, macchiato, and americano.\n\nEspresso means express. This is the fastest way to extract coffee from the beans. But the way to make it is complicated, that\u2019s why you see huge types of equipment in cafes that make loud noises, just to make that small cup of concentrated coffee.\n\nThere are DIY home solutions to produce this type of coffee - Flair Espresso, Cafflano Kompresso, and the Wacaco Minipresso. They are simple to use and don\u2019t require electricity.\n\nYou can buy a cheap milk frother and you\u2019re off to making your own cafe latte in the morning."

        "title": "Stop Pausing And Start Creating Unstoppable Momentum",
        "text": "I was once reluctantly taken to an American Graphologist for him to analyse my writing.\n\nI had been living abroad in my late teenage years, and feeling unwell constantly, with no real explanation which any of the traditional doctors could identify. Blood tests and examinations, led us no further to discover the source of my illness.\n\nOne of my older brothers suggested I see a Graphologist called \u2018Baruk\u2019 instead of going to yet another traditional doctor.\n\nA few days later, I found myself walking through a narrow cobbled alleyway, as I looked above me, there were lines of hand washing hung up resembling clouds hovering over me. It certainly was no Harley Street, I can assure you.\n\nMy expectation of this encounter at the time was minus zero.\n\nI put myself in the hands of someone I barely knew, with no knowledge of his professional background, but I felt a niggle of excitement at trying something new. We arrived at the end of the street, which signalled his address and knocked on his front door.\n\nAs I walked in, feeling like a lamb led to slaughter, I entered the smallest ground floor apartment I had ever seen. My brother chose to wait patiently on the other side of the shabby wooden front door, already scraped and worn from years of rain, wear and tear.\n\nI remember this encounter as if it was yesterday. Baruk was a wise, gentle and very confident man who analysed my writing carefully and methodically. The incredible way that every single thing he predicted about how I was showing up in life made so much sense in the years that followed.\n\nHe told me then, that I lived life through stops and starts. He invited me to imagine myself sitting in a car with one foot pressing the accelerator and the other pressing on the brakes; back and forth, signalling that I never seemed to get anywhere.\n\nAt the time, being young, inexperienced and naive, this prediction meant nothing. What did I know about life? I trusted him implicitly though, and the second big statement he threw at me as I prepared to leave changed the trajectory of my life.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why, but within a few days, determined and resolute, I packed my cases, left the middle east, and travelled out to live in London.\n\nThe illness I had then, never resurfaced again.\n\nI don\u2019t believe any doctor in the best hospital in the world could have given me a more accurate diagnosis or advice.\n\nI mention this encounter with the Graphologist, as today the wind is howling outside, it\u2019s raining, dark and cold, signalling a typical morning in London. A week ahead full of possibilities await, yet to kickstart the motivation today takes me back to his words using the car analogy of \u2018starting and stopping.\u2019\n\nWe all experience moments of an impasse in the week when nothing seems to reawaken interest when we feel absent and nothing moves us into action. Taking one step after the other, which constitutes a movement, but still not sure of the direction, even as we start to navigate, cover terrain and proceed from one place to the next.\n\nIn my writing habit daily, I spend one-hour writing before coaching my clients. Normally I sit across from my laptop and plough away effortlessly, but as much as I tried to think of the right article or the right way of commencing it, the words didn\u2019t pour out and darken the page.\n\nInstead, my mind wondered back to Baruk the Graphologist, and so today\u2019s article begins with him in mind.\n\nAs a life coach, who has worked with the mindset of hundreds of clients, I still get caught out in lack of self-motivation. The difference now is that I no longer attempt to force myself out of it or try to resist it. I just let it be and understand that some days I\u2019m so fired up that I do the equivalent of a weeks work within 24 hours. and at other times, pushing ahead with the day is like walking on treacle.\n\nSo I don\u2019t try to fight it, I just know that eventually my system will recalibrate, pop back up, and I will notice it as it does so, because things will take an effortless flow again. There are moments in life when we have to stop resisting because our internal system auto-corrects in a millisecond. there is nothing to do but be present with the unfolding of it.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, there are feelings and emotions that when they enter our world, we dread. It makes us feel icky and uncomfortable. Emotions like sadness, frustration, anger or frustration. We generally don\u2019t roll out the red carpet with these, instead, they are pushed to the side entrance. The energy we spend fighting and pushing this away can be exhausting.\n\nA mentor of mine once told me that we enter into feelings like we enter into different rooms.\n\nThey don\u2019t feel so great, granted, so in order to avoid them, we medicate, consume alcohol and create really busy lives, we then wouldn\u2019t have to stare at these feelings in the face. We perceive them as the shadow, the dark side, and we don\u2019t want to let them in.\n\nWe don\u2019t mind sitting in the movies, buying their promotional material and going to the very spot where these movies were created. But to face our own emotions is another matter altogether.\n\nWhat are the thoughts, feelings or beliefs that get in the way of building consistent momentum?\n\nIdentify and get them out there.\n\nThey could be \u2018It needs to be perfect\u2019 \u2018its not good enough\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s never going to work,\u2019 or your mindset might have a more creative dialogue.\n\nSince I have a timer when I write, to make sure I don\u2019t go over time, I do the same with the emotions and thoughts which are trying to sabotage my writing flow. I place a timer signalled for only thirty minutes when I will entertain the sabotaging thoughts/feelings and practice full surrender.\n\nI put a time frame on it because as much as I feel it\u2019s important to surrender, there has to be a time limit. Otherwise, I will not only be rolling out the red carpet, but I will be serving them continental breakfast and afternoon tea. And this is detrimental to any person who wants to flourish in their business like I would like to.\n\nJust like the Graphologist Baruk predicted, up to a few years ago, I was stopping and starting, Pressing one foot on the brake and another on the accelerator.\n\nLearning to understand my mindset, identifying the thoughts and emotions that were sabotaging my workflow, resulting in continuing to press my foot on the accelerator continuously. Only stepping on the brakes when I needed to take a metaphorical breath, catch some air and get my bearings.\n\nI had a client a while back who was struggling financially with his business, as he was not building up any type of momentum. I slowed him down and got laser focus on what was getting in the way of this.\n\nI observed how he would get into action, became productive, but the moment he had a difficult thought, belief or feeling, he began to spiral down, unmotivated and borderline depressed. He would experience such a wave of self-doubt that he would stop what he was doing.\n\nHe felt he was at the mercy of these feelings, and would become completely sucked in, either in trying to resist them or being sucked into its influence, which zapped all his energy, and there was none left to become creative or take action.\n\nI asked him to give this feeling a name \u2014 he decided that it was a male character and he called him \u2018Mog.\u2019 From thereon, whenever this feeling would plough in whilst he was actively engaged in his business, he would tell \u2018Mog\u2019 that he had to leave; he could come back later, but now was not the right time.\n\nThis was fun to create with him, and it worked a treat.\n\nIn recognising the culprit, instead of becoming passively sucked into its\u2019 influence, he began to create a fun element which allowed him to take more leadership in the interaction.\n\nWe simply identified it, gave it a name and began to interact. The difference was that my client was then in control of when he allowed \u2018Mog\u2019 in or out, rather than being hypnotised by its influences and losing a whole days work as a result.\n\nThis had a huge impact on him as he began to start a project, build the momentum, continue, follow through and complete his projects, without being at the mercy of \u2018Mog.\u2019\n\nPart of being a multi-dimensional human being (and not a blow-up doll), is that we\u2019re gifted with lots of different facets, thoughts, emotions and feelings that will drift in and out throughout the day. They\u2019re not wrong, bad or evil, but part of living fully is experiencing feeling these too. A few years ago, today would have been a wasted day where I would have paused, given up and left an incomplete piece of work. Instead, I experienced the resistance, worked through it and completed. I believe Baruk the Graphologist would be proud of how I\u2019ve moved from starting and stopping, to starting, continuing and completing.\n\nIdentify the thoughts/feelings or beliefs that get in the way of your workflow? What difference could it make to your life if you could shift this, rather than react to the feeling? Connect with me on micheleattiascoaching@gmail.com and let me know."

        "text": "I recently came across this question on Quora:\n\nHow can I tell my 15-year-old daughter she is awful at writing?\n\nThe moment I saw this, I became so incredibly angry, I couldn\u2019t control myself. I simply had to write an answer to this. To me, it stood symbolically for all those parents who are trying to forge their children into something, which they simply aren\u2019t.\n\nThese parents are basically telling their children:\n\n\u201cThis is who you (don\u2019t) have to be, or I won\u2019t love you!\u201d\n\nIn this way, society is trying to tell us who we should be. It is streamlining us into an army of willing followers, who simply do everything in the way that is expected of them.\n\nThrough millions of small acts like these, slowly our power to make our own decisions is being taken away from us.\n\nYou see, I am not angry specifically at this person who asked the question.\n\nI am angry at the fact that we have systematically learned that it is \u2018normal\u2019 to have expectations of other people to the point that we are shaping their lives into something that they never wanted.\n\nThey better get their sh*t together, or we punish them.\n\nWe punish them by slowly marginalizing them. By reducing their standing in society. By depriving them of their opportunities. By not allowing them to be a part of the community.\n\nIn this way, society clearly tells us what our standing in society is. Where we should be, and where we should stay. What choices we should make in life, in order to be an accepted member of society.\n\nI\u2019ll just do whatever I think is right for me. And anybody who wants to tell me what to do, will get a polite bye bye from me. If they can\u2019t accept me for who I am, then I won\u2019t even bother dealing with them.\n\nIf they want to deprive me of any of my rights, then so be it.\n\nI\u2019ll just carve my own path forward."

        "title": "How We Grew Traffic to Ahrefs\u2019 Blog by 1136% (and Got Thousands of Paying Customers)",
        "text": "I\u2019d just finished writing (what I thought was) my best article to date.\n\nFollowing countless hours researching, polishing my copy and fixing typos, it was perfect. All the fundamentals were covered. This had to work.\n\nOK, perhaps I\u2019m exaggerating. That article did get a bit of traffic, a bunch of tweets and even a few email signups. But did it have any significant impact on the bottom line?\n\nWorst of all, this exact thing had been happening to me for six long years. My hard work just wasn\u2019t paying off, and my attempts to figure out how a blog could help with business growth were verging on desperate.\n\nBack when I joined Ahrefs as a CMO, this blog was far from popular. It had ~15K visits per month, and traffic was plateauing, despite publishing three new articles every week.\n\nToday, we publish ~2 posts per week (in 2016\u201317, we only published ~1 post per week) and our blog traffic has grown tenfold.\n\nInstead, my primary KPI has always been ARR.\n\nI\u2019ve never tried to measure how well Ahrefs\u2019 Blog performed as a customer acquisition channel, mostly because I don\u2019t believe that conversions happen in such a linear fashion.\n\nBut if you look at our ARR graph for the same period, you can see it correlates nicely with the popularity of our blog:\n\nAnd I have zero doubts that content marketing is one of the two most significant customer acquisition channels for Ahrefs (the other being \u201cword of mouth\u201d).\n\nSo, let me share four core principles of our content marketing strategy \u2014 the same strategy that has helped us increase our blog traffic by 10x and get thousands of paying customers along the way:\n\nIt can be tempting to write about whatever currently excites you.\n\nPerhaps a hot industry topic, an exciting feature release, or even just a random rant.\n\nWhy? Ask yourself this simple question:\n\nNine times out of 10, the answer is no.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: this recent post from E! Online about Kim Kardashian\u2019s post-pregnancy diet.\n\nThis is a classic illustration of \u2018temporal content\u2019: current, topical and relevant right now, likely to generate a sharp spike in traffic.\n\nBut do you think people will still be searching for this in two years time?\n\nBecause of the post\u2019s short shelf-life, interest will quickly fade to nothing.\n\nYes, you could combat this by publishing temporal every day like E! (a celebrity news blog) does.\n\nBut this would only give the illusion that your blog is growing.\n\nAnd when you paused to focus on something else, traffic would nosedive, bringing you back to square one.\n\nNot to mention all the time, resources and energy spent constantly churning out fresh content.\n\nStep 1: Write about topics that people are searching for month after month.\n\nStep 2: Ensure your article ranks in Google for relevant search queries.\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll receive organic traffic, every month.\n\nNo need to publish 10\u201315 new blog posts every month; you can publish 10\u201315 articles in total and then take a vacation, leaving your blog traffic to grow passively.\n\nAt Ahrefs, we have almost zero flexibility with the topics we write about: no following trends or covering random topics we find interesting.\n\nWe ONLY publish posts with organic search traffic potential.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the general strategy explaining WHAT you need to do to grow your blog traffic.\n\nNow, how about some specific tactics that will teach you HOW to do it \u2014 step-by-step?\n\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t possibly explain everything you need to know in this article; there\u2019s too much advice.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent the past ten months creating a detailed video course that explains almost every single actionable tactic that got Ahrefs\u2019 Blog to where it is today.\n\nYou can sign up here: https://ahrefs.com/blogging-course\n\nTraffic is a vanity metric (have I mentioned this already?)\n\nIt barely means anything for your business.\n\nUnless that traffic consists of people who are specifically looking to solve an issue that your business happens to be an almost-perfect solution to.\n\nIn other words, if you want your content to bring you customers, you need to write about things that are closely-related to your business.\n\nTake a look at the topics of the articles that bring the most Google traffic to Ahrefs Blog:\n\nLet\u2019s say you Googled \u201chow much traffic does X\u2019s website get?\u201d\n\nNaturally, you click the first result \u2014 this post from the Ahrefs blog. It talks about the various methods you can use to estimate website traffic.\n\nWe\u2019re teaching people how Ahrefs\u2019 can be a solution to a problem they\u2019re ALREADY looking to solve, directly within our content.\n\nYes, we could publish content unrelated to Ahrefs that would get us a ton of traffic, as some companies do \u2014 but we would struggle to convert these visitors into paying customers; this tactic doesn\u2019t make sense to us from a business perspective.\n\nInstead, I assign a \u2018business value\u2019 score to all our article ideas:\n\nWe try only to cover topics that score 2\u20133 and never publish anything that scores zero.\n\nYou might be thinking: \u201cBut aren\u2019t you being too salesy? Don\u2019t you turn people away from your blog by talking about your product all the time?\u201d\n\nFunnily enough, I\u2019ve never received such complaints from our blog readers.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact."

        "text": "If you look at my archive, you\u2019ll see at least a dozen posts on Medium. Almost all of those posts are praising Medium.\n\nI take Medium seriously, use it as the single source of traffic, and learn a lot of lessons from my Medium stats. It\u2019s an excellent platform for readers, writers, and humanity.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m a fan of Medium. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t believe in its business model, and I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nThe Number of Paid Memberships Is Growing\n\nIn his last post, Ev Williams, CEO of Medium, shares the progress of Medium\u2019s subscription business.\n\nMr. Williams shares a chart of the daily new members and the total number of members. Both numbers seem to be growing, but there aren\u2019t actual numbers on the chart. We don\u2019t know whether the total number of premium members are 10K, 100K, or 1M.\n\nMr. Williams cites other stats. More than 50K writers publish at least once a week on Medium. Medium received more than 80M unique visitors in a recent 30 day period. Those are some strong numbers.\n\nThere is a critical question to be asked though.\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I don\u2019t think that conversion rate is high enough to sustain Medium in the long run.\n\nTo justify the premium membership model, Mr. Williams mentions other businesses based on similar models. One of his examples is Spotify.\n\nI\u2019m a premium Spotify member since it became available where I live. There\u2019s a huge difference between Spotify\u2019s premium and free offering.\n\nThat difference is worth more than the \u20ac100 I pay them every year, especially considering their vast, ever-growing back catalog.\n\nI don\u2019t see a difference that is worth $50 / year between the free and premium versions of Medium.\n\nIn the premium content space, Medium\u2019s offering can\u2019t compete with Kindle and Audible as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nIn the free content space, Medium is the biggest competitor of its own premium membership business. In the free audio segment, there are more than enough quality podcasts.\n\nWhile trying to prove his case, Mr. Williams is making some sad remarks in his post.\n\nI don\u2019t read \u201cfree crap\u201d on the web. The posts that I read on Medium aren\u2019t the content equivalent of the free food in the dumpster.\n\nI always have a Kindle book or an Audible audiobook as an alternative. I read a free Medium post, because I think I\u2019m going to get something out of it. The cost of a Kindle book is irrelevant to me compared to the time I invest in it.\n\nA Medium post is premium, because its author decided so. Outside of the no marketing rule, there are no criteria that separate a premium post from a free post, as far as I can see.\n\nWhat\u2019s the motivation to provide outstanding content on Medium?\n\nA writer can have several motivations.\n\nA paid membership website isn\u2019t the best way to spread your ideas, get exposure, and build an audience. Marketing isn\u2019t welcome in premium posts. Money isn\u2019t significant either.\n\nSure someone made $9K in a month, and a post made $1K, but those figures are possibly outliers. They probably don\u2019t represent a reliable income. If I were that writer, I wouldn\u2019t get a mortgage counting on that $9K monthly income.\n\nYou might argue that you have a Medium membership, because you want to support Medium\u2019s cause. I acknowledge that. I donated to Wikipedia and other non-profits in the past.\n\nI could buy a Medium membership to support it. However, that\u2019s not the point. Medium doesn\u2019t ask us to donate them money.\n\nMedium is trying to sell us something as a for-profit company. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I evaluate Medium as a commercial product, not as a non-profit.\n\nMedium\u2019s premium program doesn\u2019t provide sufficient value to the consumers. It doesn\u2019t offer enough value to the writers either.\n\nThe subscription model doesn\u2019t convince me, but there are other business models that Medium can use. I\u2019m going to publish a post about one of them tomorrow."

        "text": "The Entrepreneur\u2019s Guide to No Motivation Days At least, this is how I handled \u2018em.\n\nSome days, it\u2019s hard to get started working. No matter what you do, you just can\u2019t seem to get anything done. As a business owner, this can be pretty fatal to your business if you let it continue.\n\nAfter years of this, I\u2019ve slowly found some strategies that have helped me get past them. Everyone works differently, so these might not work for you \u2014 but, give them a try and at least see if you see any improvement.\n\nThis is something I picked up from Reddit, and it\u2019s helped me tremendously. The concept is pretty simple.\n\nNormally, once I get started I start to get into a rhythm. Which leads me to my next technique.\n\nIn the 1980s, Francesco Cirillo developed a new time management technique using a timer he had in his kitchen, which was shaped like a tomato (or, Pomodro if you\u2019re Italian like him).\n\nThe technique is simple. Start the timer for 25 minutes, and work. After the 25 minutes are up, take a 5 minute break and repeat. During your 25 minutes, don\u2019t get off task and try and accomplish as much as possible.\n\nAfter a few pomodros of time go past, take a little bit longer of a break. Eventually, you won\u2019t even need the timer.\n\nI\u2019ve been using this technique for a little over a year now, and it\u2019s really helped with my productivity. When I know I\u2019m going to have a bad day, and lose focus frequently I start the timer and force a couple tasks out. After a while, the work comes more naturally.\n\nIf you\u2019re more visual, like me, try the Forest App. Instead of tomato timers, for every 25 minutes you work you plant a tree in a little garden on your screen. They even work on planting trees in the real world for certain milestones. It tracks your phone as well, so if you get off task \u2014 the tree dies.\n\nWhatever way you do it, just make sure you\u2019re keeping track and staying focused. It\u2019ll all work out.\n\nThere\u2019s this idea out there that if you aren\u2019t \u201chustling 24/7\u201d, you\u2019re never going to get anywhere.\n\nIn fact, taking regular days to relax and reflect on your progress can help you take the step back necessary to see where you can improve.\n\nProcrastinate on taking those mental health days. When you\u2019re feeling pretty down, and you think you might need a break tell yourself \u201cTomorrow, I can take the day off if I still need it\u201d.\n\nIf you feel like you need it two days in a row, go ahead and take it. Most times though, you\u2019re going to feel much better the next day where you take it or not.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m beating a dead horse with this one, but it really does help. Every since I\u2019ve started working out and doing the keto diet, my energy levels have really spiked.\n\nIn a matter of two months, I was down 20 pounds and that added self-esteem boost gave me even more courage to do some of the things I had been resenting (things like public speaking).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt to start small, but I really recommend 20\u201330 minutes of moderate exercise every day at a minimum. As someone who sits in a chair all day for work, it\u2019s basically a requirement for me now."

        "text": "Stanford core NLP is by far the most battle-tested NLP library out there. In a way, it is the golden standard of NLP performance today. Among various other functionalities, named entity recognization (NER) is supported in the library, what this allows is to tag important entities in a piece of text like the name of a person, place etc.\n\nCore NLP NER tagger implements CRF (conditional random field) algorithm which is one of the best ways to solve NER problem in NLP. The algorithm is trained on a tagged dataset and the output is a learned model.\n\nBasically, the model learns the information and structure in the training data and can use that to label an unseen text. CoreNLP comes with a few pre-trained models like English models trained to structured English text for detecting names, places etc.\n\nBut if the text in your domain or use case doesn\u2019t overlap domain for which the pre-trained models were built for then the pre-trained model may not work well for you. In such cases, you can choose to build your own training data and train a custom model just for your use case.\n\nWe will show how we can use the NER tagger to learn entities in queries from e-commerce search.\n\nGet the dataset used below here.\n\nTraining data is passed as a text file where each line is one word-label pair. Each word in the line should be labeled in a format like \u201cword\\tLABEL\u201d, the word and the label name is separated by a tab \u2018\\t\u2019. For a text sentence, we should break it down into words and add one line for each word in the training file. To mark the start of the next line, we add an empty line in the training file.\n\nHere is a sample of the input training file:\n\nNote: Each word needs a label/tag. Here, for words we do not care about we are using the label zero \u20180\u2019.\n\nDepending upon your domain, you can build such a dataset either automatically or manually. Building such a dataset manually can be really painful, tools like Dataturks NER tagger can help make the process much easier.\n\nThe important class here is , which holds the actual model. Below is the code to build a model from training data file and outputs the model in a file.\n\nCoreNLP uses a properties file where we can define the parameters on how to build a custom model. For example, we can define how to build features to learn etc. Below is an example properties file:\n\nSince we have saved the model to a file, we can now load that model (or distribute it for others to use):\n\nFinally, we can see how the model can be used to tag unseen queries:\n\nHere is the sample output using our model"

        "text": "Personal branding. Have you heard this phrase yet? According to Wikipedia, the term has been around since at least 1997. But the concept has been around longer than that. People have written about establishing your individual brand \u2014 or marketing image \u2014 since the 1930s.\n\nPersonal branding \u2014 or self-positioning \u2014 is what you do when the product you are selling is you. For example, as a professional speaker, I need to be able to market my services by presenting a clear and consistent message telling potential clients what I have to offer. I need to be able to communicate my unique value proposition.\n\nMy personal brand isn\u2019t a fake version of me created just for marketing. I\u2019m still representing the real me \u2014 just coherently. No matter where someone encounters me, online or off, I want them to have a clear idea of who I am.\n\nIf you are planning to be an entrepreneur, you should have a personal brand too.\n\nWhy am I telling you about having a personal brand?\n\nI\u2019m telling you about personal branding because it is this professional image that you\u2019ll use to network and market your services through social media.\n\nNow let\u2019s discover how you can use social media to present your brand to the world.\n\nTo begin promoting yourself as a coach, speaker, consultant (whatever you want to be) on social media, you first need to choose your channels. There are a lot of places where you can post about yourself and your business. But my advice is to select just a few venues and focus your efforts there. You can always expand or change your focus later if your goals or your audience changes.\n\nWhen you consider which channels to use, consider your own preferences and your audience\u2019s likely hangouts.\n\nThink about where you go to look for advice and feedback about your speaking topics; those are probably the best places to reach your audience, too.\n\nPersonally, I love using Facebook for marketing. I enjoy the flexibility the platform offers. I can post links, messages, and even webcast live videos. However, not everyone who might be a candidate for my services is going to find me on Facebook. So I don\u2019t limit myself to just posting content there.\n\nMy clients include trade groups, corporate companies, business associations, and individual professionals. These audiences can be found on Linkedin. Because my audience is using Linkedin, I have to be active on Linkedin too.\n\nI also share content and post about upcoming events on Twitter. Twitter allows me to reach people quickly, even while an event is taking place. Other potential places to share include Instagram, Quora, and niche forums such as Inbound.org or private Slack channels."

        "title": "Here\u2019s why I converted my blog site to become a PWA (Progressive Web App)",
        "text": "Here\u2019s why I converted my blog site to become a PWA (Progressive Web App)\n\nIn developed economies such as the UK and the US, we now spend almost twice as long online using a smartphone than using laptops or a PC.\n\nIn fact, in my final months of working with KPMG, their entire workforce was being kitted out with tablet PCs. Hybrid tablet laptops with Windows as the operating system.\n\nClients I\u2019ve worked with have found it difficult to justify the cost of Apps for web experiences. A developer friend of mine mentioned PWAs and I became curious to find out more.\n\nThe concept for a PWA is simple, they are websites that feel like apps you would find in an App Store.\n\nAnd they can accessed through a conventional URL with HTTPS. This makes them search friendly for search engines.\n\nWith features such as push notifications, wake, refresh and instant loading for websites; they give us the opportunity to get the best optimised experience for any device.\n\nI\u2019m taking things back to basics so that I can explain some of the tech involved. So I apologise if you are already familiar with these concepts.\n\nTo create a Progressive Web App, developers created a concept called service worker. This is a bit of code that fetches information without affecting the main code that is the website.\n\nIt allows the PWA to fetch information to store it on your device. That means the website behaves as if it were an app on your device. After the first visit, it doesn\u2019t need to stay connected for the website to be present on the device.\n\nSo how easy is it to create a Progressive Web App without much experience of coding?\n\nFor someone like me for instance, who is familiar with code, but not enough to call themselves a developer.\n\nFirst of all, I tried the PWA Builder.\n\nI put my blog website URL in the box and waited. The page then analysed my site for any information that was missing.\n\nThe analysis showed that I am missing icon images to use to launch the website from a mobile device.\n\nThe next step of the builder created the Service Manager code for me to download.\n\nCode generated for web, windows, android and IOS. Now before I get too excited, the PWA builder is by Microsoft.\n\nAt the moment, Microsoft seems to making technology easy for people to access. Microsoft have embraced the opensource model.\n\nThat is to say they make it easy to transfer or adapt code to work in Windows and elsewhere.\n\nThe logic is of course clear. Microsoft make their ecosystem an easy choice for everyone.\n\nTurns out, I could not fathom out how to add the code to my blog site using WordPress and the premade template.\n\nI can just about change the CSS and entertain the idea of changing HTML. Looking at the code sample in the PWA is deceptive. It looked simple to put in place.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t simple, I needed to access something called \u201cThe Manifest for Web Apps\u201d.\n\nWhenever I get stuck, Google search is my best friend and ally. I typed in the words \u201cProgressive Web Apps Wordpress\u201d into the search bar.\n\nThe first result of my search was for a Plugin for PWA.\n\nRather than go down the DIY route of adding code generated by the PWA tool\u2026 There\u2019s a plugin ready to go in the WordPress community of Plugins.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I favour WordPress above other Content Management Systems. I\u2019ve worked with open source Drupal as well as Umbraco as well as enterprise level ones such as SiteCore.\n\nThey all have their particular strengths. It\u2019s about picking the one that best suits the task in hand.\n\nFor me WordPress was a clear choice for a personal blog. It has a community of developers that are helpful. Plus bloggers who want to share their experience.\n\nThe clincher was the fact that it needed zero knowledge or skills for programming or coding.\n\nI installed the plugin and followed the instructions.\n\nI will explore the tools available in Firebase another time. Right now, I\u2019m interested in getting my blog site converted into a PWA.\n\nIt took a while to figure out as I\u2019m not that patient when it comes to reading through instructions. If anyone who writes instructions out there, please take note:\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to provide a screen grab as it helps identify the page or function to look for:\n\nTo activate the plugin \u2014 you need to open and complete some details from the Firebase account. The starter license for Firebase is free, so it\u2019s great to be able to experiment and find out more about the features.\n\nOnce created, there is a toolbar for the settings. Toggle this, which then opens up a series of tabs. Select \u201cCloud Messaging\u201d and copy the code from this into the plugin, the screengrab below shows the code generated in Firebase to use in the WordPress Plugin.\n\nMy reason for doing this isn\u2019t random. I like exploring new ideas and technology, it also means I learn something new from the experience.\n\nHere\u2019s why I made my blog site a PWA. I\u2019ve noticed that I get push notifications on my mobile for tweets and Instagram posts. They are a distraction and I\u2019ve learned to ignore them when I need to focus on a task.\n\nBut, when I\u2019m receptive to them, they make me want to click and explore the new notification.\n\nFor brands seeking to increase audience engagement, a push notification generates awareness. It puts the brand in the pockets of their target audience.\n\nWhilst it\u2019s possible to develop a Web App, the downside is that it requires Wifi or 4G/3G access to connect to the web.\n\nIt seems out of the box plugin for WordPress is a simple solution that saves the website pages on the local device.\n\nPWA removes the barriers of App Stores, creating an app like website and that is the point. It can brings your audience closer to your brand, whether connected to the web or offline.\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed the process of converting my site to a PWA and now that I know it is relatively simple \u2014 a child could do it\u2026. (me) as a proof of concept for me to explain what\u2019s involved in simple terms. It also means I can explore on future projects wider benefits and use cases, especially when a client asks about whether to build an App or not."

        "text": "If you feel like Life is punching you in the mouth, read on.\n\nYou\u2019re down in the dumps. For whatever reason, life up to this point has gone unexpectedly, especially of late. The saying, \u201cnever give up\u201d most likely only refuels the fire that you have for wanting things to progress or change.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, that phrase kind of pisses you off more than it motivates you. It\u2019s the easiest advice that everyone is giving you \u2014 \u201cWell just keep trying, you\u2019ll get there\u201d, or \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day\u201d.\n\nWhat they fail to tell you is that Rome had architectural plans, a road map, and the resources to build! Resources that included engineering minds that were geniuses of innovation in their time.\n\nWhat you would give for a road map, much less the resources to get going. But, no one bothers to attempt to understand how hard you\u2019ve already tried, how much work you\u2019ve been putting in, and how discouraged you are when they tell you, \u201cyou\u2019ll get there\u201d.\n\nWell, since we\u2019re on the subject of Rome, I think it\u2019s important to look at how they were able to think unlike anyone else which allowed them to build the legendary city.\n\nMany of Rome\u2019s ancient buildings that are still (half) standing today were built with a special concrete. Long story short, they developed a type of \u201cpaste\u201d that allowed their buildings to withstand harsh climates and even chemical erosion.\n\nThe recipe used was put together with slaked lime and volcanic ash. They also built tens of thousands of miles of paved road. In this road, they constructed specific \u201ccurves\u201d so that water could properly drain off of them. Some of the roads are still used today.\n\nThe point is, they were innovators and had to think creatively on how they could each use their gifts and talents to contribute to accomplishing the work that was set in front of them.\n\nNow, maybe you\u2019ve been working your butt off for a promotion, maybe you\u2019re trying to finish your degree and it\u2019s getting more difficult, maybe you\u2019re grasping at a job, anything to get you by, or maybe you\u2019re going through a life change or a loss and the burden is significant to bear.\n\nYou have to find the recipe to build the strongest base of you that you can. Sounds awesomely cheesy, I know. Sorry, but something as simple as mixing slaked lime and volcanic ash is not your answer.\n\nBut, your answer could be as simple as your attitude. Giving up hope, in a way, is essentially called giving up.\n\nI see a lot of entrepreneurs on Medium as I\u2019m reading different posts. People love to create and start things that are their own. The truth is, if they aren\u2019t able to get through the criticism and the \u201cwhat the hell are you doing that for?\u201d questions, then they will give up before they\u2019ve even started.\n\nSo, don\u2019t let your hopes become thwarted before you even start your journey.\n\nA couple years ago, I was unemployed. I wrote a post about things I learned while being unemployed and in one of the blurbs I targeted my attitude during this time.\n\nI said, \u201cAre there times of bitterness, sadness, lack of confidence, and anger? Of course, but I can actively choose every single day to either entertain all that negativity or to put it to death\u201d.\n\nI consistently had to choose my attitude. I think that\u2019s lost on people sometimes. We think we\u2019re a victim of our attitude. Like it\u2019s some monster under the bed that just comes out and we can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cyeah but I can\u2019t always help the way I feel and that isn\u2019t my fault\u201d. You are correct, but I\u2019m talking about your reaction to the way you feel.\n\nOften times, I will flat-out declare that I\u2019m irritable just to make it verbal. It\u2019s really an accountability measure more than anything else.\n\nIf the builders were like, \u201cyou know what, look at all this crap we have to get done. We have to create the Colosseum and create the stuff to build the Colosseum?! Screw it, I\u2019m out\u201d, then we wouldn\u2019t even have that wonderful phrase to highlight this post.\n\nChances are, if you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re dealing with loss (of any kind), the attitude part may have to be your consistent battle every day.\n\nPrayer, meditation, music, writing, or reading books might be what you need right now every day to just keep going. That\u2019s okay.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to accomplish something, move up in the work force, get a new job, finish school, etc. then there is action that needs to go along with getting your attitude right.\n\nWhat was significant about Rome was their methods and materials. As said before, they were innovative, creative, and different. There\u2019s a reason for that.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been trying the same thing over and over with no change in the result, then change the method. Set yourself apart.\n\nStop writing the same bland cover letter. Stop just \u201choping\u201d your boss is going to notice the long hours you\u2019ve been putting in and will just hand you a promotion.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s as simple as asking if they can meet with you once per week or maybe once per month to allow you to expand on some of your thoughts or ideas about what the company is accomplishing and the work you plan to put in.\n\nNow, depending on what type of boss you have, this may not be okay.\n\nIf you\u2019re running a start-up or your own business and have hit a road block on it\u2019s progression, change something, anything that will allow you to get the right advertising you need to build a customer base.\n\nThis could come in the form of networking with other businesses or emailing people and setting up presentations that allow you to advertise your own stuff, or even expanding your social media platform.\n\nAnd, when you continue to fail, over and over again (it may happen), keep a positive attitude and stay creative. Things sometimes take a lot longer than we would like or anticipate, but while you\u2019re in the middle of the storm, look around and recognize areas that you can improve along the way.\n\nOne of my favorites by MJ,\n\nTo be afraid of failure means to fail.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t dragged through everything in your life up to this point, you wouldn\u2019t be the person you are today.\n\nKeep trying, keep changing, stay positive, stay creative, and never. give. up."

        "text": "We're All Trying to be Better Professionals. But What Makes Us Better Clients?\n\nTwo people contacted be for translating services last week. In both cases, I politely explained how my pricing system works and gave an estimated deadline according to the length of each piece. One potential client wrote back inquiring about my credentials, to which I replied with a detailed summary of my background, an attached r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the link to my LinkedIn profile.\n\nNone of them wrote back.\n\nNow, normally I try not to take these things personally, because as a freelance professional, you really can\u2019t expect to land every client you prospect. In fact, I feel very fortunate to have build a certain reputation in which I\u2019ve had these two contacts come to me instead of the other way around. Nonetheless, since both clients behaved in the exact same way, it did get me thinking.\n\nI truly believe that most people don\u2019t realize how significant it is to hire someone for a job. To put it bluntly \u2014 you are asking someone to do something that you cannot do yourself in exchange for money. Because clients bring monetary value to the table, we automatically assume that the power is all in their court. Is it, though?\n\nTo me, any type of work (especially creative work) is a two-way street. Yes, the client has the right to make demands. But the best projects I have ever worked on were those in which everyone on board understood that we were building a relationship, that the results depended on how well everybody partnered up. There was mutual trust and, most importantly, mutual consideration.\n\nOf course, this example refers back to a job that I landed. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to expect the same respect from a potential lead. I would have loved to have received some feedback on why they didn\u2019t choose me. Did they feel the price was too high? Was the deadline too long? Help me help you.\n\nI turned the tables on myself and asked how I would behave if I was in the client\u2019s shoes. Would I have written back if I hadn\u2019t liked that price estimate? Probably not. I would probably act as if I was in a store and none of the clothes I tried on fit, walking away quietly after leaving everything scattered in the dressing room.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\nHaving gained some perspective from this experience, I am committed to being more straightforward in my business relationships. As clients, we\u2019re a major part of the process. And it is only fair to keep everyone who\u2019s involved in the loop."

        "title": "A new approach for social networks \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "New social networks should be designed with more thought.\n\nHere I will try to give an example on how using a sociological concept can inform the goals of a new social network.\n\nDunbar\u2019s number is a sociology concept that may be very useful for designing social networks. Per Wikipedia, Dunbar\u2019s number is \u00ab a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships \u00bb. There is extensive work on the subject, and people who already tried to understand how this concept relates to (cyber) social networks. A simple web search will give you plenty of information on this.\n\nBut ! Even if this concept has been studied somewhat extensively, in effect it seems that it has been ignored or misused by current dominating social networks.\n\nLet\u2019s define a \u201cgood\u201d social relationship as a one-on-one relationship where each participant gains something for each interaction. The gain could be knowledge, money, solving a problem, having a good time\u2026 Quantifying the gain depends on a set of values. For instance, money could be very important to some people, for other people it could be knowledge.\n\nSo qualifying a relationship as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d than another relationship, depends on one\u2019s values.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that most people want the security that comes with trust and knowing that you can count on someone. That people want to be helped when they have a problem. That people want to gain money and have a good time. And that they want to reciprocate all that. In roughly this order of priority.\n\nThe current social networks (Facebook, Twitter\u2026) do not tick most of the boxes if we quantify social relationships this way. They mostly provide some entertainment, with a big dose of anxiety, outrage, and egotistic comparisons.\n\nDunbar\u2019s number more or less refers to the maximum number of relationships that one can manage. Let us expand on the concept and give some hypotheses.\n\nFirst that there is a limit on the social relationships that one can manage, and this limit is across all media and all types of relationships. Second that even \u201cweak\u201d relationships such as Facebook acquaintances \u201cuse up\u201d part of Dunbar\u2019s number, even if they use it less than very close relationships.\n\nWith these hypotheses, we could draw a comparison with a bucket.\n\nOne can manage at most 150 stable relationships (Dunbar\u2019s number). This is the \u201crelationships bucket\u201d. One can fill up the bucket with 150 stable relationships at most, or maybe 50 stable relationships (those that demand more \u201cwork\u201d) and 200 weak Facebook relationships, that demand less work, but still end up filling the bucket.\n\nSo, Facebook relationships can in some instances take the place of other relationships. Concretely Facebook relationships still require some time, some memory and attention. And studies tend to prove that new communication tools do not change Dunbar\u2019s number.\n\nBut, Facebook relationships are mostly \u201clow-quality\u201d as we expressed it earlier. Of course one can have meaningful, rich relationships using Facebook, but it seems the exception more than the norm.\n\nThis is a big problem: Not only are current social network often toxic, but they also fill our \u201cDunbar\u2019s Bucket\u201d.\n\nWhat can help social networks provide quality relationships?\n\nWe can suppose that in real life, and historically, the most fruitful relationships are/were relationships either at the family level, or with geographically close people, such as relationships within a village, neighborhood, or city. Relationships with people that you can easily see in-person, to exchange ideas or goods, buy, sell, work together, do stuff together.\n\nOne way for (cyber) social networks to be really useful would be to nurture, develop, aid these local relationships, which are generally more on the \u201cquality\u201d side than long-distance relationships.\n\nIn this case, the software tools should be synergistic with real-life relations, they should not replace or diminish them.\n\nHelping real-life local relationships is also a worthy goal and may reduce the alienation that can appear with the loss of the traditional \u201cvillage community\u201d in the face of urbanization and geographical mobility.\n\nHow could a social network help local relationships? Maybe by helping develop new interactions with people nearby. By providing software tools to help discovery, information sharing and management of interactions. With modern life, most of us have thousands of people living nearby (that you can meet with each traveling less than 30 minutes, say). But we do not know most of them. A social network platform should help us know these people, and have interactions that develop in \u201cgood\u201d (as described above) relationships.\n\nSocial network should help bring down walls, enabling us to interact fruitfully with people we may not have met by ourselves. Quite the opposite of the current social networks with their bubble effects, feedback loops and groups of like-minded people that create walls in our heads\u2026\n\nThis is an example of how taking a sociological view and exploring a sociological concept can be useful for finding the \u201cwhy\u201d and driving the design of a social networking platform. Currently sociology seems either ignored or misused. For instance the famous \u201caha\u201d moments of Facebook and Twitter (when an used has a certain number of \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfollowers\u201d and is \u201chooked\u201d) may have underlying causes in Dunbar\u2019s number or a similar concept, but it is only seen through a psychological/behavioral view, and is only used as a metric, a goal to reach to have addicted users.\n\nSociology can and should be a tool for designing better social networks, and having clearer, better goals besides amassing users and monopolizing their attention."

But to be successful, you need to keep showing up.\n\nIt seems obvious \u2014 but how many times have you stopped showing up to something just because you\u2019re not seeing results fast enough?\n\nTo make an impact, you need to keep showing up again and again \u2014 even when you don\u2019t want to.\n\nEspecially when we don\u2019t want to.\n\nAfter a while, showing up becomes easier \u2014 when you become so used to showing up that not showing up feels out of the ordinary.\n\nBut how long does this take?\n\nAt some point, you\u2019ve probably read somewhere that it takes an average of 21 days to form a new habit.\n\nBut unfortunately, this isn\u2019t quite true.\n\nIt was Maxwell Maltz, an American cosmetic surgeon practicing in the 1950\u2019s, noticed that it took around 21 days for his patients to get used to seeing their new face.\n\nFrom this information, he realized that he also took around 21 days to form a new habit.\n\nThis book went on to become a bestseller that influenced the work of almost every \u2018self-help\u2019 professional around the world.\n\nAnd somewhere along the line, people simplified the phrase \u2018minimum of 21 days to form a habit\u2019 to \u201821 days to form a habit\u2019.\n\nAfter all, who wouldn\u2019t like the idea of forming a life-changing habit in as little as 21 days?\n\nHowever, it turns out that in reality, things aren\u2019t quite so simple.\n\nA study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology has shown that the time taken for someone to form a new habit varies wildly.\n\nParticipants in the study actually took between 18 and 254 days to form a new habit.\n\nOn average, it took individuals 66 days to form a new habit \u2014 a length of time considerably longer than the 21 days that is so often quoted.\n\nSo if managed to religiously stick to your running schedule over the past 21 days and you still don\u2019t feel the urge to leap out of bed each morning and jog around your neighbourhood, don\u2019t fret.\n\n\u2026you just need to keep going for another 21 days.\n\nBy then, it might have become a habit.\n\nBut you\u2019ll probably need to keep going for another 21 days.\n\nLearning a new skill is rarely fun at the beginning.\n\nThe first hundred times you go out for a run, you\u2019ll feel like your breath is being sucked out of your lungs.\n\nThe first million words you write will be garbage that no one other than your mum would ever want to read.\n\nAnd you\u2019re going to have to put your great idea for the next Facebook on the back-burner while you learn how to make your code output \u201chello world\u201d.\n\nBut the next hundred runs will feel less straining. And soon you\u2019ll be able to write that \u201chello world\u201d program with your eyes closed. And maybe when you write your two millionth word, a stranger will email you to tell you that your words brightened their day.\n\nThinking about it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nDaydreaming about what it\u2019ll be like when you\u2019ve actually done it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nYou have to actually keep showing up and doing it.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you can send me a message at aimee.pearcy@gmail.com \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear from you. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nOtherwise, please clap & share to let me know you liked it! \ud83d\udc4f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f"

        "text": "Historically, revisionist history has gotten a bad rap and maybe deservedly so \u2014 case in point in the tweet below. There are those who will forever be in pursuit of denial disguised as their pursuit of the truth, and vice versa.\n\nWhich begs the question of whether or not Mark Twain actually uttered the line about denial in the first place\u2026\n\nAs a society, we should strive to collectively turn a corner and learn to accept all the different angles a story can come from. Some of us may have even pointed and laughed at Florida, circa 2006, when then-Governor Jeb Bush and his Florida House of Representatives banned the teaching of \u201cRevisionist History\u201d in public schools.\n\nEvery milestone, both good and bad, in the thirst for knowledge is a part of the process and should be appreciated as such. It\u2019s a chance to step back, view the bigger picture and consider the source of any new evidence before buying into a story \u2014 because you just never know. Plus, there could always be something to be learned from the reject pile. There is nothing inherently wrong with revisionist history, as long as it\u2019s truthful and factual.\n\nPraxeology \u2014 the science of human action \u2014 dictates that all action is directed toward some end. It takes Newton\u2019s third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction \u2014 and gives it an arbitrary deadline.\n\nClickbait is effective as a short-term solution in driving traffic your way, but truth in quality content beats revisionist history every time. Comedic films such as The Hangover take this theory to new heights as a parody of our own lives. Let\u2019s face it, we all have \u201cthat\u201d friend in our closest social circles suffering from selective memory \u2014 the one who remembers events differently than everyone else in the group. Whether some form of inebriation is involved is a story unto its own; you have to decide for yourself whether said friend is a reliable source.\n\nProducing quality content online for your business isn\u2019t so different. Before anything goes live to be consumed by the masses, there can be an endless amount of revisions that the end-user never sees nor should be subjected to. Content creation teams bear that brunt and wear their badges proudly.\n\nYou\u2019ll rarely meet a writer who doesn\u2019t want credit where credit is due and on the flip side, every good writer owns up to their mistakes. There may be no \u201ci\u201d in team, but the source of each edit matters. Accountability and credibility matter in a team environment because building trust is crucial.\n\nAt Story Chief, we provide a means to an end to the countless edits and revisions with a feature called version history, a must-have for any editorial team. Transparency in the form of a bird\u2019s eye view, of all the changes made in a story, is no longer a luxury but a basic need. Every member of the editorial team must have the ability to swoop in ad hoc, or go back and restore or recycle previous versions. Updating and relaunching \u201cold\u201d content is now \u201cnew content,\u201d and the responsible thing to do in the alarmingly saturated content library of the world wide web.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve embraced the beauty of the creative process and feel the same pain everyone else does in seeing ideas get tossed around and inevitably tossed completely, with an endless trail of dead darlings killed off \u00e0 la Quiller-Couch. Yes, Quiller-Couch, and not Faulkner. A reminder, again, to always check your sources in case you don\u2019t believe us.\n\nBut what if you could bring your darlings back to life?\n\nYou can, at Story Chief. You don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel because your hub and all its spokes will always remain in version history. We make revisionist history great again. Join us and see for yourself."

        "text": "The future of design is in the hands of machines.\n\nIsn\u2019t it crazy to think that just ten years ago, we were talking about the new revolutionary iPhone and how it was going to change our lives forever?\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and Apple\u2019s never-ending stream of iPhone updates are old news.\n\nThe real hot topic is AI \u2014 aka, how computers are starting to outsmart us.\n\nAs always, technological advancements change (and will continue to change) our experience with products.\n\nMeanwhile, technology continues to create new opportunities for organizations and designers. And companies that succeed in following new trends \u2014 especially before competitors catch on \u2014 are the ones who will come out on top.\n\nThey\u2019ll be able to create new-and-improved user interfaces for their UX that are both autonomous and adaptive.\n\nMy own company, JotForm, has experienced this first-hand. While developing our new online form, JotForm Cards, we utilized the latest technology available to us to create a UX like no other.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not the only ones.\n\nHere are some examples that illustrate exactly what I mean\u2026\n\nA product cycle consists of a number of stages. Whenever a discipline completes its job, it passes the responsibility to another discipline. Naturally, transferring this shared meaning takes some time. And time is something that no one wants to waste.\n\nAirbnb recently announced a new autonomous technology to address this issue. Their technology translates designers\u2019 whiteboard drawings into component-specific, executable lines of code for Airbnb engineers. By condensing several stages of the product cycle, they save plenty of time \u2014 and get ahead.\n\nFor the past eight months, we\u2019ve been working on a new form design at JotForm. Desktop and mobile versions weren\u2019t working quite how we\u2019d hoped, and our embed form view results fell short; so, we began digging a little deeper to better understand the root of our issues.\n\nShort version? Our research showed us three different embed form views that didn\u2019t fit our design (Box View, Column View, and Custom View).\n\nHence why it was tricky to maintain our responsive design approach using an embedded-forms website (because of unclear scaling and styling issues).\n\nSo, we decided to create an autonomous and adaptive system in order to generate a) proper form layout solutions and b) styling options for our users.\n\nHere\u2019s one of our new features at JotForm Cards \u2014 basically, it automatically matches our form to the design of your website.\n\nWant to give it a try? Just copy and paste the script-embed code to your site. JotForm Cards will analyze it and generate the best look for your website.\n\nThe technology we used to create this is called Smart Embed, an adaptable embed view that changes a form\u2019s layout and styling.\n\nIn a nutshell, it organizes the form\u2019s content to scale based on iframe size. It also generates styling to ensure visual harmony. And if you\u2019re not quite satisfied with the results, you can tweak it using the online edit mode.\n\nLogos are an important visual representation of any brand. But sometimes, it\u2019s not straightforward to combine a logo with a website in a way that flows nicely.\n\nWe\u2019ve experienced this issue first-hand. That\u2019s why we decided to create an autonomous, adaptive feature that takes a company\u2019s logo and generates a custom form based on its aesthetic.\n\nThe form\u2019s background, buttons and progress bar styles change automatically when you add in your logo. JotForm Cards also re-arranges the color scheme to make sure everything matches beautifully.\n\nYou can test out this feature in the My Forms section of the JotForm dashboard. Just add your logo to your welcome page, sit back and watch the magic happen\u2026\n\nEvery form at JotForm has a unique identity. So, if a form has a logo, communication between the form creator and its respondent improves. But some form creators may not have, or use, a logo.\n\nJotForm Cards uses custom icons to solve this problem. If you\u2019re a registered user, your form icons will be generated from your industry details. If you aren\u2019t a registered user \u2014 or you haven\u2019t defined your industry in your user profile \u2014 JotForm Cards will interpret an icon from your form title.\n\nCheck out this example:\n\nCustom background images are another cool feature of form-creation. But styling secondary design elements (such as buttons and progress bars) to complement these background images can be a pain for an inexperienced user \u2014 or simply someone short on time.\n\nWith JotForm Cards, you don\u2019t need to be an expert to design a cohesive form: you just need to upload a background image that reflects your tastes and preferences. JotForm Smart themes will handle the rest.\n\nAll UI elements of the form will be modified to guarantee an attractive end result.\n\nGoogle recently released Auto Draw, a program which generates visual elements based on users\u2019 sketches. Whatever you\u2019re capable of sketching with a mouse will automatically be completed \u2014 and improved \u2014 with AI.\n\nAuto Draw updates its suggestions based on submitted drawings. Users can also see a recommended \u2018closest match\u2019 from the \u2018do you mean\u2026\u2019 section.\n\nBrandmark is an AI logo generator. It\u2019s different to Smart Embed in that it requires a user\u2019s input. Essentially, it generates logo concepts based on keywords submitted; all you need to do is type your company\u2019s name and add in a couple of descriptions. Brandmark will autonomously find a proper typeface and icon. Then, it combines them to create your brand new corporate identity.\n\nHere\u2019s an example based on my input:\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the result, you can fine-tune it using the edit mode.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact: autonomous and adaptive design creates a better UX. They increase the quality of products while making them accessible to more people.\n\nTechnologies like these also save time and enhance a designer\u2019s capabilities.\n\nAnd companies who are able to follow this trend will reap the benefits early on.\n\nIs AI going to take over the world? Who knows. Maybe there\u2019s an even bigger \u2018next big thing\u2019 round the corner.\n\nBut in the meantime, let\u2019s make the most of the innovation at our fingertips.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

        "title": "How effective is your lead generation? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Whether you are trying to start your own business or attempting to grow an existing one, your research has doubtless inundated you with industry jargon. Certain sales and marketing terms are everywhere, but no one ever seems to be able to fully explain what they mean. One hackneyed phrase you may have encountered is \u201csales funnel.\u201d What exactly is a sales funnel, and how can it help you grow your business?\n\nThe funnel is a simple visualization of the sales process, with awareness of your brand at the top and closed sales at the bottom. There are a million different depictions of the funnel, each with their own labels and captions and bars and arrows and levels of granularity. But here is the one that will be used throughout this chapter and guide: Visitor > Lead > Qualified Lead > Opportunity > Customer.\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to help you direct new visitors into the funnel, turn them into leads and nurture them through the process until they become customers. Before you can jump into that involved process, though, here are in-depth definitions of each portion of the lead funnel.\n\nA person who visits any of your online properties, your website or your physical location is considered to be a \u201cvisitor.\u201d This is someone who may not have known about your company previously and is still performing casual research. Ideally, information on your product or service is visible and engaging enough that their interest is piqued and they are enticed into the sales funnel.\n\nAccording to the most recent PwC Global analysis of online shopping trends, for certain purchases, 62 percent of global shoppers prefer to research them online. This means that if your business is not engaging and catching the attention of each visitor from the outset, you are unlikely to retain them and convert them into a customer.\n\nOne way to accomplish your goal of making the visitor aware of your business is to have a well-designed website that clearly communicates the problem you solve, how you solve it and how they can get it. Eliminating noise and creating a clear message is the best way to ensure that visitors will want to continue to get to know more about your company. When they make that decision, they have just converted from a visitor into a lead.\n\nA lead is someone who has opted in to receive information from your company, and/or to be contacted by your company in the future. A lead might be someone who filled out a form online or entered their contact information into a different type of gathering service.\n\nMatthew Guay from Zapier said it best in The Marketing Funnel Guide: How to Qualify Leads and Turn Them Into Customers: \u201cRandom people on the street aren\u2019t leads. They could become leads in the future \u2014 for now, though, they don\u2019t know about your product. Leads, on the other hand, took action. They walked in, signed up, picked up the phone, asked.\u201d\n\nLeads are in the initial phase of the selling process, and needs to be nurtured in order to move further down the funnel. In this phase, the lead is someone who is interested in your product or service, but still has no definite purchasing intention.\n\nHere, your job is to pique the lead\u2019s interest enough that they are willing to take the next step: to develop a deeper interest and begin to engage with your product or service. To do so, you will provide them with information that will encourage them along the lead funnel process. At this point, you remain unclear as to whether or not the lead is actually willing or able to purchase from you.\n\nA qualified lead (or \u201cprospect\u201d) is someone who has demonstrated their ability and likelihood to purchase your product or service. There are several methods of qualifying leads. Some leads will qualify themselves by adding an item to their cart, for example; others may be qualified through asking specific questions in your sign-up form, such as income level or favorite brands; still others may be qualified using software that estimates the chances that an individual will make a purchase from you.\n\nAs you qualify leads, separate them into the \u201chaves\u201d (those who have demonstrated the ability and inclination to purchase your goods or services) and the \u201chave nots\u201d (those who do not have the ability or intention to purchase your product). The people who will actually purchase your product are those you will nurture, moving them along to the next step in the sales funnel. The others \u2014 or those who just want you to deliver them free, quality information forever without actually making a purchase \u2014 can be retained in an \u201cemail-only\u201d passive candidate pool.\n\nQualification in this manner helps to keep you from spending money on leads who will never convert, and allows you to target your efforts on those with the highest chance of converting. Once you have a list of qualified leads, you will initiate two-way communication with them, reaching out to them individually and beginning the personalized communications that will lead to trust in your product or service. At this point, your objective is to move the people from leads to opportunities.\n\nAn opportunity is a person or business who is actively considering buying your product or service. Your beginning nurturing steps are integral in leading a consumer to this point. All opportunities must share three characteristics:\n\n\u25aa They have a specific pain that you can solve for them. Without this, they will not purchase.\n\n \u25aa They have a specific interest in your product or service. They might know their pain exists, but not be altogether interested in fixing it.\n\n \u25aa They fit specifically with your company. Your product or service offering is developed for companies of their size or people with their budget.\n\nOnce you have identified a qualified lead as an opportunity, your goal is to find out what information the prospective opportunity needs or wants from you. Remember that this step \u2014 and every step (see Chapter 9) up until this point \u2014 are meant to do one thing: build a relationship. You need to provide the necessary information that they want or need in order to make their purchase from you. Most people make decisions based on emotions, and then back those decisions up with ration; your job is to develop that emotional relationship, then provide ample information to back it up.\n\nOpportunities are the people you actively sell to. This will probably be the most demanding and critical stage of your funnel, and it might also be the longest stage of your sales funnel. At this point, you have verified the consumer\u2019s need for and fit with your product or service. This is the time for you to close the deal, and to create a customer out of the opportunity.\n\nThis term should need little to no introduction. Customers are the people who have taken action, purchasing your product or service. You know they already like what you are offering enough to give you money. So that\u2019s it, right? Not quite. Now, your job is to continue to engage with them and continue to nurture them.\n\nKhalid Saleh, author and CEO of conversion software Invesp, explains that it costs five times as much to acquire a new customer as it does to retain a previous customer; so it is in your best interests to continue selling to customers long after their first purchase.\n\nOnce someone has reached this level in your lead generation funnel, you want to encourage them to take action again by selling the same product to them; to expand their initial purchase by upselling additional products or services to them; and to refer you and your product or service to everyone they know. One easy, automatic way to encourage a customer to take action again is to integrate different apps or services into your existing forms (see our growing catalog of options for ideas). Since these are consumers who have already indicated interest in your product and purchased it, you can leverage that sense of trust and dependability to offer more of your goods and services.\n\nOne the most important \u2014 and often overlooked \u2014 parts of nurturing customers is referrals. A recent Nielsen survey showed that 90 percent of internet-using consumers trust recommendations from people they know, and that people are four times more likely to buy a product when referred by a friend. What should you do with this information?\n\nEngage your customer and solicit a referral. You have already won their trust and have qualified them as someone who can and wants to purchase your product or service. Now, you can skip a few steps in the sales funnel and have your customer bring new qualified leads to you \u2014 pre-vetted people who already have an interest in your product and are willing and able to buy. They have an emotional connection to you \u2014 their friend just vouched for your product \u2014 and you have a lead that can move towards the final \u201ccustomer\u201d phase more quickly and with a lower investment.\n\nThe rest of this guide is designed to help you learn how to get visitors to your site, convert them into leads, nurture them and measure your lead generation and conversion efforts. By the end, you will have a new, versatile tool in your toolkit that will help you develop a relationship with your leads, turn them into customers, and grow your business."

I am five months into unemployment and one month into my e-commerce journey.\n\nMe and my wife have savings that\u2019ll last us two more years of no work. It helps that we live like minimalists and are based in Bali Indonesia, where the cost of living is lower than the Philippines.\n\nBut financially we are not doing well. Our bank account is bleeding cause there\u2019s no money is coming in. We don\u2019t have a steady paycheck and our e-commerce journey is not bearing fruit. We are still on the natal stage and it\u2019ll take us three months before we can start selling on Amazon.\n\nAnd then it hit me \u2014 I have the wrong perspective. All this exploring and unemployment stage is not an expense. This is an investment.\n\nWhat I lack in paychecks, I compensate with time and energy. I wouldn\u2019t have the time to learn about e-commerce, talk to suppliers and design products if I have a day job. I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to do so.\n\nSo what is the return on investment (ROI)? When will I get back the 5000 dollars that we have spent so far? If we get the Amazon business right, it can pay itself in a matter of six months. That is if we get things right.\n\nAsk yourself what is the ROI of your investments?\n\nOne investment I made was buying a power rack. I have spent years working out at a gym. Imagine the monthly membership I had to pay every year compared to buying my equipment. This option was inspired by Mehdi whom I follow because of his program \u2014 StrongLifts 5x5. Apart from the money I\u2019m saving, I save time. It takes me on average one hour to drive back and forth.\n\nIn the Philippines, a local unbranded gym will cost you 20 dollars per month. If it\u2019s Gold\u2019s or Anytime or Crossfit, that\u2019ll cost you 60 dollars. The rack cost me 1000 dollars. With simple mathematics, this will yield me 4.12 years of ROI.\n\nNot bad. I\u2019m not going to stop working out after four years.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019m obsessing about is an espresso machine. How many lattes do you drink every week? You can get a good espresso machine for 100 dollars. Starbucks averages 3 dollars per latte. That machine will pay itself after thirty cups.\n\nWhat\u2019s the ROI of your toxic friends? Don\u2019t spend an hour every week with people who bring you down and give you negative energy. It\u2019s not going to yield you anything positive.\n\nAre you currently starting up your business? Thinking about a big purchase? Or evaluating your social relationships?\n\nRemember to take into account your return on investment.\n\nTalk to you soon my friend."

The criteria for each of them are as follows:\n\nKeeping a daily journal is one of the most rewarding things you can possibly do. I have used one since I was 6 and would lose my mind without the sense of calm it injects into my days.\n\nFirst, divide the page in two. On one side, write down everything which is on your mind as a sort of idea capture. Get it all down as quickly as possible. I like to state it in the plainest terms possible as if explaining it to someone with no understanding of my situation. Each bullet point goes something like \u2018I feel X because of Y and Z\u2019 or \u2018A is wrong and that is making me feel B and C.\u2019 It does not need to be any more complicated than that. If you feel like ranting or going into a lot of details, turn that into a separate journal entry. This page is all about creating an inventory of your current problems, no matter how big or small each one is. This stage is to let you articulate your exact situation. It\u2019s common to be anxious without any real idea of what is causing it, which is why I find this stage so cathartic.\n\nOn the other side of the page, write an equally simple list of potential solutions for each problem. Again, keep each point short and broad. I find that some of the issues become meaningless as soon as they are on paper. A few lines of self-reassurance is enough to solve them. Sometimes all I have to write is \u2018this is bullshit. I am doing fine. Forget this point and move on.\u2019 In fact, you would not believe how often that is the real answer. For others, I write down an idea for a more thorough resolution.\n\nThis next part is optional, although usually necessary. Once the first page is full, take another to write a detailed, step by step plan for each of the biggest problems. This part is what makes this technique practical, not just satisfying. Writing down problems does not eradicate them. There are always ways to solve (or at least reduce or handle) them.\n\nThis post was originally published in January 2017."

        "title": "The dialogue between stories and consumerism \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Did you know that the universe is made of tiny stories? From cave painting to movies, stories never seem to stop fascinating mankind. Although the methods have drastically changed over the years, the desire to share and hear stories still greatly impacts everyday life. Great storytelling is what compels us to take action, to vote, to donate and most importantly, to buy.\n\n1: Storytelling is what makes us human\n\nIn one way or another, much of people\u2019s lives are spent telling stories. From a very young age we love listening to stories and, as we grow older, they become more and more powerful. Who doesn\u2019t remember the story of the forbidden fruit, little red riding hood and many other notorious classics. The idea that these (thousands year old) stories are still being passed on from generation to generation is pretty remarkable. How is it we can hardly recall what we did two days ago but we cant forget a thousand year old story? Well, as it turns out stories quite literally spark our senses, they engage our brain to imagine, elaborate and recall. According to Stanford University, stories are remembered up to 22 times more than a fact alone. That\u2019s why throughout history stories have been used for survival, to persuade and to give direction.\n\nWe don\u2019t distinguish between reading, hearing or experiencing a story and feel whatever emotions the characters are experiencing; anxiety, sadness, happiness, or relief. That\u2019s why they are so powerful, they elicit physical reactions in us. It\u2019s in our nature to see narratives even where there are none. We are a species addicted to stories, it is one of or strongest, oldest impulses. It is how we remember, connect and express values. Even when we\u2019re asleep our mind can\u2019t stop creating stories. They are a form of existential problem-solving. With an average human attention span lower than a goldfish, we need them for survival. Jungle book taught us to embrace our surroundings and enjoy life, little red riding hood taught us (among other things) to not trust a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing and coca cola thought us sharing is happiness. The thing all of stories have in common? They focus on universal human characteristics and how we take action to make a difference.\n\nIf I tell you the estimate of the number of slaves today range from around 21 million to 46 million, you\u2019d probably stand still and be astonished for about 5 seconds, and then move on to the next thing.\n\nHowever, let me tell you the story of Benita, a young 13 year old orphan. Whose tall for her age with freckles, big brown eyes and curly hair. Benita is one of the 46 million slaves that live in our world today. She lost her parents at a young age, and ended up having to work 12 hours a day for $2.43 / hour. She can\u2019t afford staying home when she\u2019s sick, hell, she cant even afford to try one of the shoes she sews everyday.\n\nHow much more likely are you to remember Benita\u2019s story? If I then tell you you can help Benita by buying one of our sneakers, there is a big chance you would be compelled to do so. Not because you urgently need a flashy new pair of shoes, but because you can see a smile appear on Benita\u2019s face while making the purchase. You won\u2019t persuade people to take action by throwing around some cold facts and figures, they simply don\u2019t stick! Use a story however, and people find common ground, they become emotionally involved. Research shows that messages with moral and emotional words are more likely to spread online. As it turns out, with each moral or emotional word the probability of it being reposted increased by an impressive 20%.\n\nThis is probably where the idea of solutions before product was born. Content has become such an overwhelming commodity that it only takes a blink of an eye to answer the question \u2018why should I care?\u2019. Now, almost all ads focus on providing solutions, community building and brand awareness, so what sets you apart from the rest? A good authentic story does. A great narrative literally connects us, when I tell you a compelling story our brainwaves will match up. We buy what we\u2019re emotionally drawn to and then logically justify it later. The use of language, settings and characteristics that we can resonate with, that bring reassurance and helps us visualise our future. You start with what we know, blend in some vivid details, common experience, and your unique twist. The twist, that\u2019s where context comes into play. Context shows you\u2019ve been paying attention, it is context that will make sure your common spirit and values will be remembered and it is context that makes you authentic. Most of our decisions aren\u2019t made rationally, it\u2019s our emotions that have the power to change opinions overnight. We stopped purchasing goods and started buying emotions. So without a compelling story, your product, idea or brand is dead on arrival.\n\n4: Storytelling with a whole new toolkit\n\nWe now have more ways of sharing our ideas and experiences than ever before. Technology has opened a door to a whole new level of storytelling. A great example is packaging. For a long time packaging was more regarded a necessity than a storytelling tool. But then some smart brains realised that every detail of the packaging tells a story, so why not make sure it\u2019s the one they want told. Suddenly supermarket shelves became a piece of art, with innovative materials, unique cut outs and lots of colour. Technology took it a step further and the brand story become more dynamic. Personalised packaging, hashtags, QR codes, augmented reality they were all created to take storytelling to the next level. In a way, brands turned all of us into storywritters, allowing us to personalise and change small details. But how do you tactfully use all this knowledge of someone\u2019s habits without letting them know you\u2019re studying their lives?\n\nMarketeers can\u2019t seem to stop screaming it out, serial storytelling, multi-faceted storytelling, engagement storytelling\u2026 All the commotion around storytelling got me curious. When did brands actually start leveraging stories and why?\n\nWay back before the internet-era, we were in the golden era of advertising. Cheesy in-your-face advertising was carried out through infomercials on radio, televisions, and billboards. Brands were busy building characters that match the products, nonetheless, the product was always at the forefront. People embraced ads, they had something optimistic, and at times, revolutionary. Brands were an authority we looked up to and ads only had one purpose: to sell, sell, sell.\n\nNevertheless, the birth of the internet turned the world of advertising upside down. Not only has it changed the way ads are broadcast, but it mainly changed the way consumers act towards them. The lines between who \u201cneeds\u201d who is more blurred than ever as brands need to get consumers on board to help sell their products. Brands first have to prove themselves before consumers will even consider taking a look at them. Detergent is no longer just detergent, it is a tool to help solve climate change. A watch isn\u2019t just a watch anymore, but a device that might save your life and the list goes on. Somewhere on the road consumers switched gears from being passive bystanders to being the most crucial part of advertising.\n\nWe\u2019ve been telling the same stories for millennia but now the story got a new narrator. Brands aren\u2019t just struggling to have their story stand out, but they increasingly have to focus on how people share their story.\n\nThis explains the constant rise of influencer marketing. Digital word-of-mouth needs to feel authentic to be effective among consumers and unlike brands, people are who we trust. Although they might have turned themselves into brands, influencers are people first and that still enforces trust. It makes us wonder, why is it so much easier to believe the same story told by a person instead of a brand?\n\nIs it because social media, magazines and billboards are notorious for endorsing whoever bids the most, while influencers still handpick the brands they choose to praise? Is it because we see brands as an extension of what the influencer stands for? Or is it the personal stories and authentic content they share that makes the product more relatable?\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just influencers persuading us to take or not take action, crowdsourced and user-generated content have been in full exploration for the last few years. Brands shifted from creating content to entertain you to creating content that engages you to make some more. We shifted from innocent bystander to creative masterminds and entered an era of collaborative storytelling.\n\nIt\u2019s the age of identity, and identity is all about the story you\u2019re buying. No pressure at all, right? You\u2019re a Mac or a Windows, a Heineken or a Duvel. The product is no longer the centerpiece, but the \u2018why\u2019 behind the product has taken over. A \u2018why\u2019 molded in a story with familiar traits of common values and promises and every interaction with the brand breathes that story.\n\n7: The Secret Dialogue Between What We Buy and Who We Are\n\nAs human beings we constantly want to feel connected with others. Interestingly, consumerism seems to be extremely effective in achieving this goal. We are more connected but feel lonelier than ever, as a result we identify ourselves with brands. You are what you buy and you buy who you are. Great narratives engage, they invite the listener to participate, to act and to tell the story onwards.\n\nCrowdsourcing platforms have never been as successful. Why? The companies on it are great storytellers! As kickstarter says: \u201cideas that ignited the imaginations of a community, creators providing greater access to their creative process, and voices that are often underrepresented are among the most commercial success stories\u201d. In a way we show who we are and what we stand for by assembling the stories of brands. We talk back! By buying products, creating content and showing up, we become part of what the brand stands for. In a way we buy our entrance ticket to an entire community.\n\nWe communicate complex messages through what we buy, but also through what we don\u2019t buy. We invest in sustainable product so brands will be forced to invest in sustainable solution. We call for a retail boycott when we question a brands ethics. It leaves us to wonder, are brands telling their stories through us, or are we telling ours through them\u2026"

Talk about someone who cares.\n\nWhether intentional or not, this is what companies do day in and day out with their new hires.\n\nIn the book, \u201cThe Power of Moments,\u201d authors Chip and Dan Heath kick of the second chapter with the following question -\n\nDid you walk into the office and immediately feel comfortable and think to yourself, \u201cWow, I just made a great decision. All the talk about company culture during the interview was not just talk, these people walk the walk. This place is incredible.\u201d\n\nYou get the idea right?\n\nBusiness reviews shout the benefits of \u201cPeople, Product, Process\u201d \u2014 Hell we even have Marcus Lemonis slamming it down our throats every week on his TV show \u201cThe Profit,\u201d yet when most of us start a new job we feel more like an inconvenience than we do a priority.\n\nWe applaud entrepreneurs and businesses when they say, \u201cWe don\u2019t put our clients first, we put our employees first.\u201d\n\nThey shout, \u201cHappy employees, equals happy clients,\u201d and we all cheer and think to ourselves what a great place that must be to work.\n\nYet our eagerness to start a new job and make a real difference at the very place that sings the songs above, is met with indifference \u2014 and eight long hours later you leave the first day at your \u201cdream job,\u201d thinking that you just said yes to, \u201canother job.\u201d\n\nNew employees are expected to come in and do their job, but from day one we see most of the managers we are supposed to be learning from, not doing theirs.\n\nAnd the worst part of this is that it is even not that hard.\n\nWe all sit through worthless meetings that accomplish nothing, but when was the last time you sat down and had a five minute meeting about how you can make the new hire feel special?\n\nWednesday, May 2nd, may just be another day for you, but for the new person on your team it is a huge day \u2014 and it is up to you to take their new energy and add to it by making them feel welcome.\n\nI get it. As a manager challenges arise everyday that did not exist a few minutes before. I have been there before and will be there again.\n\nBut this does not mean you cannot be available when the new hire arrives for a quick introduction, even if just to say, \u201cAt 12:30, if it is cool with you, I will come around and the two of us can go grab a bite to eat,\u201d before passing them off to another team member to make introductions so they can meet the other team members.\n\nOut of all of the sound advice in Dan and Chip\u2019s book, the line, \u201cThe lack of attention paid to a new employee is mind-boggling. What a wasted opportunity to make a new team member feel included or appreciated,\u201d hit me the hardest and I hope it does for you to.\n\nAsking someone to sit down and fill out paperwork becomes a lot more tolerable if it is preceded by even fifteen minutes of acknowledgement.\n\nAnd if you are a manager that does not have fifteen minutes for someone who you are going to rely on for the next year, you may want to reconsider how you are managing."

        "text": "A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a small version of a new product that can be used to gather the maximum amount of useful feedback from customers with the least amount of development effort.\n\nAn MVP strips out all unnecessary functionality, and includes the bare minimum amount of features in order to get feedback from potential customers.\n\nIt\u2019s an established, useful concept that, when utilised correctly, can minimise wasted time in the early stages of defining a product vision and establishing product / market fit.\n\nRather than spending a large amount of time creating a full product and hoping for traction, you can identify the crucial functionality and build just these features, in order to determine whether to pivot, or to pursue the project.\n\nChoose the audience and scope for your MVP carefully\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking at creating an MVP, you should have a hypothesis in mind that you\u2019re looking to prove or disprove \u2014 essentially, a measurable way of saying whether your MVP succeeded or not.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to create a general-purpose MVP to obtain feedback, but the problem is that different types of users have different expectations, motivations and abilities to understand your product vision at an early stage.\n\nImagine you\u2019ve created a micro-site to test whether your new \u2018widget\u2019 works well. If you test your MVP against a broad audience, you\u2019ll probably receive feedback such as:\n\nWhereas you were actually looking for functional feedback about the widget itself, such as:\n\nYou know that the micro-site doesn\u2019t work well on iPad, but that wasn\u2019t the purpose of the MVP.\n\nEven with explicit instructions to focus on the widget, some users will become distracted with other parts of your MVP, because users have different expertise, interest and expectations.\n\nTesting your MVP against a broad set of users will result in less-specific feedback, and this can waste valuable time and money if you\u2019re trying to focus on one particular area.\n\nTargeting the format of your MVP to users with a specific persona or technical ability can really help to obtain more useful feedback.\n\nFor example, at my startup Swiftcomplete, we provide a customisable search engine as a service. If I planned to test a new piece of functionality, I would create a different MVP depending on the user persona:\n\nIn reality, I would probably break these personas down much further, in order to create a more personalised and valuable experience for the recipient.\n\nFor example, I could create a Postman collection specifically designed for Salesforce developers in the manufacturing industry, or a video aimed at councillors to demonstrate how search technology could benefit local libraries.\n\nThe more valuable the experience to a user, the better the quality of feedback, and the more useful the MVP is likely to be.\n\nAvoid creating a general-purpose catch-all MVP if you\u2019re looking for feedback on a specific area of your product.\n\nCreating an MVP can reduce the time that it takes to validate an idea for a product or functionality.\n\nIf you create a one-size-fits-all MVP and send it to a broad audience, you\u2019ll receive a wide range of feedback that may miss the point.\n\nTargeting an MVP to a specific audience creates a valuable experience that results in more specific, actionable feedback, that can be used to determine whether to proceed or pivot at an early stage."

        "text": "With SaaS subscription-based software expected to continue its exponential growth, managing this growth is increasingly important. The following is a list of metrics to begin tracking your SaaS Subscriptions.\n\nNOTE: To get started managing your SaaS, consider downloading (at no cost) The SaaS Management Spreadsheet which brings many of these metrics together.\n\nFirst, you want to find your SaaS subscriptions. Most companies have a great deal of Shadow IT. Whether or not your employees are hiding them intentionally, these apps can be difficult to uncover. There are many ways that these subscriptions can remain hidden and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is finding them all.\n\nYou can start with a manual process, for example by asking people or looking at expense reports. That will uncover some of the apps in use across the organization. You can up your game by using an automated discovery tool like Alpin, which can discover all your apps using a variety of methods.\n\nWhichever method you choose, you will want to collect the general information of each of your SaaS subscriptions. Here are a few data elements that you should track:\n\nOnce you have a working list of your apps, the next step is to begin tracking your costs and contracts. Through accurate tracking of these subscriptions, you can increase efficiency and significantly reduce costs. Proactively managing these contracts will improve budgeting, help you achieve SaaS license compliance, as well as give you the upper hand in negotiating renewals.\n\nThe more Saas apps you have, the more work it will take to keep a lid on costs. Tracking SaaS subscription renewals can be a huge task that costs lots of time and resources (not to mention stress) when done improperly. It may feel like incoming signups and renewals are a never ending game of whack-a-mole.\n\nAutomation can eliminate this time-intensive and error-prone process. Alpin can help you cut SaaS costs by up to 30%, manage renewals, ensure license compliance, monitor and archive activity, get notified about important events, and more. You can govern all your SaaS applications in one dashboard, avoid surprises, and negotiate smarter.\n\nExtensive research on the security of your active apps, and what data they have access to, is a daunting, yet essential task. According to a Ponemon Institute\u2019s poll, the odds of a data breach have increased to 1 in 4, and the average cost is estimated at $3.62 million. Additionally,over half of IT professionals have identified a SaaS application as the source of a malware infection. Do you know what apps are active behind the scenes at your company?\n\nHave your users told you about their gaming apps? Dating apps? Gambling apps? They are there, we promise, and they are not just a waste of time, they are also potential security risks. Another area of security risks arises from users publicly sharing files that contain confidential information. This data leakage can have serious consequences.\n\nSince this information is particularly difficult to obtain, consider using a solution like Alpin that focuses on SaaS application security. Alpin not only gives you information, it also allows you to blacklist apps that present a security risk. And Alpin will tell you which files are shared publicly, so you can take action and pull that data back inside.\n\nWe hope this list helps you improve your SaaS Management. For an easy way for you to get started at no cost, download our Free SaaS Management Spreadsheet.\n\nLearn how Alpin can help you uncover your SaaS usage in just two clicks!"

They don\u2019t actually care what drill you use.\n\nHowever, it is stupid by this definition:\n\nActually, marketing is beautiful. It\u2019s also behind the times. The two most innovative companies of the past century (Google and Facebook) are both, for all intents and purposes, ad tech companies. There are also a suite of killer marketing tech tools available. There\u2019s a ton of backing to marketing tech startups and technologies.\n\nBut marketing is still archaic. Why?\n\nThis is the process I follow to make it a little bit less stupid. Typically, clients start with: \u201cWhat do you think $X could get me?\u201d Or, \u201cWhere do you think we should market?\u201d (For the record, it urks me when marketing is used as a verb).\n\nThem: This is like saying, \u201cHey, I want to make dinner. What ingredients should I use?\u201d\n\nMe: I don\u2019t know, Jack (at the time of writing this, I don\u2019t work with anyone named Jack). What dish do you want to make?\n\nThem: Well, I think I can spend $30 on this meal. What could that get me?\n\nThis type of thinking is akin to, \u201cWhat should I spend?\u201d \u201cWhere should I spend it?\u201d \u201cShould I do X?\u201d\n\nWhen you start a business, or roll out a new product, you are inherently making assumptions about human nature.\n\nIf I start a coffee mug company today, I am implying that 1) I can do this better than every other coffee mug maker, and 2) I know I can do this, because I know what humans want in a coffee mug more than the other companies.\n\nWe all have the tendency to just roll with this thinking and start figuring out where we\u2019ll sell these knock-your-socks-off-slap-your-grandma-and-call-her-skippy coffee mugs. But I find it helpful to take a step back.\n\nWe are hereby assuming:\n\nWrite these out. Put em on sticky notes. Use a whiteboard. Whatever floats your sloop. We\u2019re not getting tactical. We\u2019re just surveying the landscape without making any more assumptions.\n\nAssumptions are things we accept as true without data. Hypotheses are testable.\n\nEvery initiative a business undergoes should fall in to 1 of 2 categories:\n\nWhen an initiative is in the hypothesis phase, you are looking to validate whether or not it\u2019s true. In order to validate it, you need to define the appropriate metrics over a time period. I like 30 day windows.\n\nOnce the hypothesis is validated, you focus on scaling it. The validated stage is for minimum viable errthang.\n\nOnce you whittle it down to 2\u20133 hypotheses per category, figure out what metrics would give an accurate representation of the validity.\n\nThese are the umbrella hypotheses I feel everybody needs:\n\nEverybody has one. Some have it more than others. What\u2019s yours? This is not related to your team, drive, or ambition. It\u2019s related to the problem you are solving.\n\nDo people have this problem? (if yes, move on)\n\nIs it a big enough problem that they\u2019ll pay to fix it? (if yes, move on)\n\nDo you have the right solution to the problem?\n\nDon\u2019t use surveys for this stage. People vote with dollars and their time. Surveys are kind of like giving a 16 year old their driver\u2019s license based on their own assessment of themselves.\n\nMetrics can vary to pretty huge extents for this phase.\n\nWho are you talking to?\n\nDo have the problem that you identified?\n\nFor startups, this is usually pretty small data sets. Identify your hypotheses, then figure out where those people hang out. Then go meet them in person and pitch it to them. If they don\u2019t dig it, they\u2019re probably not the right audience.\n\nOnce you find out who you\u2019re talking to, then figure out what you\u2019re saying to them.\n\nDoes it move the needle?\n\nDoes it influence them?\n\nThis is isn\u2019t the tactical post, but I\u2019ll dip my toe in that water.\n\nPick 3 headlines, spend the minimum daily budget on Adwords, and put the headlines as the copy. Create a blank landing page that just says, \u201cwe\u2019re under construction.\u201d and have an email list signup form. It\u2019s not important that you get emails. The only thing you care about here is the CTR (click through rate) on the ads. The highest CTR wins.\n\nWhen Tim Ferriss was writing the 4 Hour Workweek (one of my favorite books), he couldn\u2019t decide whether or not he wanted to call it \u201c4 Hour Workweek\u201d or \u201cSelling Drugs For Fun and Profit\u201d. He employed this tactic, and ultimately picked \u201c4 Hour Workweek\u201d.\n\nMy, how the world could have been different had the latter won the competition.\n\nOnce you do that, then build a 1 page site using the winning headline, with 2 paragraphs of copy, 3 images, 1 video, and a call to action (form, quiz, ebook, whatever). This is where you test the other messaging elements: secondary messaging, taglines, narrative structure, etc.\n\nYou can manually create landing pages, use Google Optimize (it has a killer free version), Optimizely (no free version), Unbounce (DEFINITELY no free version), or anything of the like. Here, you\u2019re testing call to actions. Whichever combination has the highest, wins.\n\nHow are you actually going to get them to buy?\n\nThis includes everything from acquisition channels (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.), to offers (discounts, quizzes, ebooks), to some other stuff that we\u2019ll delve into with the tactical post coming out next week.\n\nHere, we want to test with a very limited budget. Rather than throwing $20k at it straight out of the gate, test it with $500. You already have the other elements. This should be the easier part. Here\u2019s how you decide what to spend*:\n\n*note, It\u2019s not important that these estimated metrics are super precise. It\u2019s just important to get the car moving so that you can steer it along the way. Don\u2019t spend more than 5 minutes estimating.\n\nThis is where you operationalize this. I\u2019m gonna go into this more in the next post.\n\nIf something isn\u2019t validated, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is invalid. Don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater. You very well might be just a couple of tweaks away."

But I answered anyway.\n\nThe voice on the other end started the call by saying , \u201cHello Mr. Fiallo. This is Maria from National.

Maria was calling about a bad experience at the airport in Miami on Thursday as I was turning in the rental.\n\nFor those of you that have flown in and out of Miami International Airport and had to navigate the jungle that is the Rental Car Center, you know of what I speak. Don\u2019t be in a hurry. Have lot\u2019s of patience. Wear comfy shoes.\n\nMaria was calling. At my home. On a Friday evening.\n\nThis call was clearly being made outside of her normal working hours. She was following up because she suspected that after her efforts to resolve my problem at the Rental Center on Thursday, I was still unhappy.\n\nDid someone direct her to call? Doubt it. It didn\u2019t sound like that kind of call.\n\nPerhaps I should set the stage and tell you what the issue was. These types of situations are typically not simple and straightforward.

        "text": "Understanding leads to progress and progress leads to understanding.\n\nEmpathy has been a buzz word in the service industry. There\u2019s practically an infinite number of articles that talk about it. I understand that as a customer service professional, talking to people about empathy can be super simple, but what\u2019s harder is ensuring that their level of empathy is at least the same as yours.\n\nWhat is exactly the mystery behind empathy? It\u2019s simple.\n\nIn the early days of a startup, most people will have the chance to experience a customer facing role which is an awesome advantage that most founders tend to forget about. Going above and beyond for your customers at the early stage increases your customer\u2019s trust and competitive advantage which can also lead to loyal customers.\n\nHow can you ensure that your team can continuously provide the same level of empathy?\n\nAs your business grows your customers also increase in number which leaves you with no option but, to scale your customer service team. Increasing your service team to even 1 person can be a crucial decision because you want to make sure that as your team grows, the level of empathy they have for your customers will remain consistent.\n\nRemember, that your customers can be your greatest ally (or enemy) and understanding them and genuinely feeling for them can massively increase their overall experience."

        "title": "The Art of StartUp Motivation \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Being an entrepreneur and running your own business is one of the hardest things you can do. It will tax every fiber of your patience, your finances, your family, your health and even your sanity.\n\nMotivation and your ability to dig deep and keep going even when everyone tells you to stop or when people cease to believe, is one of the critical things that separates those who succeed from those who litter the pages of startup history. Your level of motivation day in day out has a direct impact on all of the following, just to name a few:\n\nGetting S**t done: You ability to stay motivated is the primary driver in your ability as an entrepreneur to get things done. Whether it\u2019s those extra few lines of code, making 10 additional phones calls or making your 100th investor pitch, ultimately running a business and your ability to deliver is driven by how motivated you are to get the job done. If your motivation slips, things begin to get delayed and it can quickly be a downhill ride from there.\n\nEnrolling others: I talk about this often as a coach. One of the keys to getting things done, especially things that are hard, is sharing your goals with others. When you share your goals with others, not only do you get them curious and excited about what you\u2019re doing (since, if they care about you, they\u2019ll want you to succeed) but you also enroll them as passengers in your journey. Some may even text or call you about how things are going and how much progress you\u2019re making. The more motivated you are, the easier it is to get people excited about your journey and, if you\u2019re lucky, get them to actually join or help you out in some way. This is even more important when you have a team of people around you. When people see the founder is incredibly motivated and feel that energy, it\u2019s easier for them to get motivated and push forward when times get tough.\n\nGetting momentum: Have you ever felt that when you do a series of things in relatively quick succession they build on each other? Motivation, and being able to dig deep when you need it, is a key factor in creating momentum. The faster you, and those around you, see things happening, the easier it is to continue forward when things start to get hard. When you build momentum and see progress, you get into a flow where things simply start to happen. This is especially the case when you hire / bring on new people into your company. Getting them in can seem to take forever and be a real grind, but once they\u2019re in and start delivering on things, you\u2019ll notice that things start to happen that you\u2019re not even aware of.\n\nBuilding a better product: When your motivation level is high you\u2019ll be more focused on spending additional time getting your product right. You\u2019ll work harder to correct flaws, bugs or quality issues that may make the difference between a good product and a great product. You will also inspire others to go the extra mile to come up with innovative ways to make your product do things you don\u2019t expect and exceed customer expectations.\n\nSelling more stuff: Your ability to be excited, high energy, enthusiastic and positive will have a direct impact on your customers\u2019 willingness to buy. When you make that extra sale and get a new customer, that also helps build momentum and can lead you to the next customer. Just last week, I sold in 3 proposals in a row to clients. The energy was contagious and each and every sale just got easier and easier. Clients could actually sense my energy and motivation and that made them more comfortable to want to work with me. Motivation leads to success which can lead to more success as your confidence grows.\n\nStaying curious: I often find that people who are highly motivated are also generally incredibly curious. They\u2019re always looking for ways to break the mold and rewrite the rules of the game. Curiosity is the lifeblood of any successful business. It helps us build better products, shorten time to market, resolve customer issues more quickly, try new things and continuously hone how we grow our businesses. When you\u2019re highly motivated you\u2019re more likely to challenge yourself and others to think outside the box to solve complex problems.\n\nFind your Purpose: How can you reach your destination unless you know what it is? One of the key things you find among people who are hugely successful, whether they\u2019re founders, athletes or celebrities, is a crystal-clear sense of purpose. For some it\u2019s about a singular big goal like curing cancer or winning a championship, while for others their purpose might be to prove to themselves and those around them that they can achieve something epic. As a marketing coach, one of the main reasons marketing executives seek me out is because they\u2019re unhappy or frustrated with their lives. They\u2019re aimlessly running on the treadmill of life going through the motions one day at a time without any clear purpose. Once you find out what your purpose is and you share that broadly with the world, the universe simply seems to click into place and it becomes much easier to decide what you will and won\u2019t do.\n\nDevelop SMART goals: To fulfill your purpose you\u2019ll need goals. When you start with your end goals in mind, it\u2019s easier to keep your motivation up as you see yourself making progress. Establishing yearly, quarterly, monthly and weekly goals for yourself may seem daunting and you might not always hit them, but it helps you become disciplined and focused. Smart goals are Specific, Measurable, Accountable, Relevant and Time bound. Break those goals down into digestible bits that you can work towards on a daily basis. The more you see yourself hitting those goals, the easier it becomes. For example, my yearly cycling goal is 2500 miles so I know that I need to ride 208 miles per month or little over 50 miles per week. More importantly, I share my rides with all my followers on Strava each week which keeps me honest and motivated.\n\nSurround yourself with OQP: Les Brown, who is considered by many as one of the world\u2019s best motivational speakers, says it well: Surround yourself with Only Quality People. The higher the quality of the people you surround yourself with, the more inspired you\u2019ll feel about pushing yourself beyond your limits and the more motivated you\u2019ll be by their success, drive and passion. You might even learn a trick or two about how they stay motivated as well.\n\nShare your goals: If you\u2019re the only one accountable it\u2019s easier to cheat. If you have people working with you, particularly OQP, you can use tools like Asana to create your goals, break them down and allow others to \u201cfollow\u201d you as you complete them (or don\u2019t). Sharing your goals with others not only enlists them to help you deliver the goods, but also holds you accountable to taking action as well so that you\u2019ll really question yourself when you don\u2019t achieve what you set out to do.\n\nDevelop a \u201ckiller\u201d routine and stick to it: Routines are key. I can\u2019t stress this enough. On average, it takes about 14 days to get into a new habit but once you get into it, it can make a world of difference. For me, the killer routine is on my calendar. For example, I call Tuesdays Typing Tuesdays, because every Tuesday I\u2019m creating great content.\n\nHere\u2019s what my Tuesday routine looks like:\n\n- 6am up and at em!\n\nYou might notice that I try and take breaks every 90 minutes or so. At the very least, I try to go for a quick walk, get some air, stretch and get some water. Why? Well according to this article in Fast Company: \u201cYour brain can only focus for 90 to 120 minutes before it needs a break. Why? It\u2019s the ultradian rhythm, a cycle that\u2019s present in both our sleeping and waking lives.\u201d\n\nSleep: In Silicon, many people, particularly young entrepreneurs seem to think it\u2019s a badge of honor or that it\u2019s cool to permanently be in crunch mode and get little sleep. Guess what? It\u2019s not. It will literally, make you dumber. In this article on Business Insider, University of Berkeley sleep expert Matthew Walker, who is professor of neuroscience and author of \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d, attributes a lack of sleep to increases in blood pressure, increase in the chance to get cancer, a low level of amnesia (due to our inability to effectively create new memories), and increased risk of developing alzheimer\u2019s (due to the build-up of certain proteins in the brain). Extreme levels of wakefulness (ie. being awake 16+ hours after you should be sleeping) basically act as \u201clow level brain damage\u201d according to Walker. So do yourself a favor: stop being cool and get your 6\u20137 hours. I sleep 7 hours a night and don\u2019t function properly if I don\u2019t get them. I\u2019m moody; lacking in energy; don\u2019t get enough done and then get even more moody because I don\u2019t get done what I need to get done. The result: My level of motivation plummets.\n\nMusic: It\u2019s widely proven that the right music can really give us bursts of motivation and energy when we need it most. In my case, it\u2019s electronic dance music (EDM). When I\u2019m writing, music helps get me into a zone and is highly motivating. The key is to understand what kind of music motivates you and when is the right time to use it. For example, when I\u2019m doing strategy work or crunching numbers, I can\u2019t use music as it distracts me too much. But when I\u2019m doing more creative work like writing posts, creating graphics or writing a speech, the right music not only motivates me, but also improves the quality of my work.\n\nMotivational videos: I admit this one is a bit new to me, but I recently started listening to motivational videos on YouTube several times a week. Some of these videos, like those from Motivation Madness, can certainly help and provide bursts of inspiration when needed. The important thing is always to tie this back to your SMART goals and to keep the ball moving. Nothing will give you more motivation than actually working hard and seeing the results of your work or getting the praise of colleagues, friends and clients. Motivational videos can provide that extra boost each morning and could be part of your routine, but don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that just watching this videos is going to help you reach your goals.\n\nSo that\u2019s it for me folks. I hope this post has been useful. If it\u2019s been helpful please like, share and comment below. Also remember that mad mork stories is now on audio so check out my podcasts on Anchor.fm.

They don\u2019t want to have to move from the couch, pretend to change out of PJs by putting on a coat and Ugg boots, or go outside in any way, shape or form.\n\nTheir motivations may be varied (small kitchen, can\u2019t cook, lazy day, bad weather, hiding out, Netflix binge, hangover, etc.). But their need remains the same. They\u2019re itching to indulge in whatever specific craving they have right here and right now, in the privacy of their own homes. If that means scarfing down a whole box of Milk Bar cookies in the bathtub, so be it.

        "text": "This Mindset Will Make You More Creative and Innovative\n\nYour birthday is coming up soon.\n\nYou want to make it the most memorable ever. So, you call your friends for help. The brightest minds get together to plan your party.\n\nEveryone is excited. Some throw obvious ideas, other go with wilder ones. The brainstorm feels promising though it has just started.\n\nHowever, after a few minutes, the energy hits rock bottom. Your friends feel stuck. Most are checking their phones; they are not looking for ideas \u2014 they are just escaping boredom.\n\nYour idea is not as good as mine. There\u2019s no time. That idea is not cool. There\u2019s no budget for that.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what happens to most teams at work. They start brainstorming like if they were planning a party \u2014 everyone is excited and full of energy. But, all of a sudden, the party turns into an event no one wants to attend.\n\n\u2018No\u2019 is the enemy of creativity.\n\nBrainstorming is a game of addition. That\u2019s why a \u2018Yes, and\u2019 approach is so effective. It invites people to collaborate and build on everyone else\u2019s ideas.\n\nEach idea is a step \u2014 brainstorming is about building the staircase as a team.\n\nPlanning a team party is an effective way to bring the \u2018Yes, and\u2019 spirit to life. It\u2019s effective to set the right mindset before you kick-off a brainstorm \u2014 but also a great reminder of the power of true collaboration.\n\nBreak your team into groups of 6\u20138 people. The challenge: plan a party to celebrate last quarter\u2019s achievements.\n\nSounds simple, right? Though every round has a trick.\n\nRound 1: Everyone shares an idea (one-at-a-time). Every time one person shares an idea, someone else replies: \u201cNo, what we need to do is\u2026\u201d and explains his idea.\n\nRound 2: Same approach. This time, the response is \u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d The person presents an objection and then shares his/her idea.\n\nRound 3: Finally, you bring up the \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d approach. People need to build on other\u2019s ideas by replying \u201cyes, and we can also\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to put this into practice to realize what happens.\n\nThe \u2018No\u2019 immediately drains the energy out of a team. People feel that is pointless; the brainstorm will get nowhere \u2014 everyone is focused on killing other\u2019s ideas by pushing their own.\n\nThe \u2018Yes, but\u2019 has the same effect, but is more irritating. People pretend to be polite but are actually dismissing ideas in a politically correct fashion. It feels everyone is patronizing the rest.\n\nA team that plays together stays together. That\u2019s the biggest benefit of a \u2018Yes, and\u2019 mindset.\n\nWhen you apply a \u2018Yes, and\u2019 approach only good things can happen. From animals \u2014 both stuffed and real \u2014 live bands, Eskimos, exotic places, you name it; the party turns into a fun and wild one.\n\nUnfortunately, in most companies, people are wired to say \u2018No\u2019 to new ideas.\n\nThe purpose of the exercise I shared above is to help people realize what they are bringing to the innovation table.\n\nThe mindset that you bring to a brainstorm shapes the creative outcome.\n\nInnovation and creativity are fun but are a serious game.\n\nCreativity is the number one priority for most organizations, according to Boston Consulting Group. It\u2019s also a competitive advantage in an uncertain workplace where predictable jobs will soon be replaced by technology.\n\nEveryone \u2014 managers and not \u2014 should play with the \u2018Yes, and\u2019 approach. And challenge the usual mindsets that get organizations stuck.\n\nBeing right puts us in \u2018scrutinizing mode\u2019: we are looking for evidence to prove other people wrong. That\u2019s the problem with \u2018best practices.\u2019 Once a company defines the best way to play the game, teams are expected to follow a rigid process. People are supposed to do what\u2019s considered \u2018right\u2019 rather than experiment new ways to do their work.\n\n\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broken, why fix it?\u201d is a concept that drives disengagement. People want to be challenged, not to do repetitive tasks.\n\nMany organizations expect their people to be flawless, but they are not. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s okay accepting mediocrity by any means. However, people are humans; they bring their personalities, emotions, perspectives, and stories to the workplace. Rather than pretend them to hide their vulnerable side, let\u2019s realize that is humanity what drives creativity.\n\nPerfectionism is the worst enemy of change.\n\nEveryones talks about the importance of innovation, but very few leaders actually walk their talk. Teams don\u2019t need encouragement and motivational speeches. To embrace experimentation, organizations must provide a safe space. They need to have a \u2018mistakes policy,\u2019 as I explain here. To rethink mistakes as a means to learn and improve.\n\nWhen people are afraid of getting fired, don\u2019t expect them to be creative.\n\n\u2018Yes, but\u2019 speaks about perfectionism: people focus on what\u2019s not working about the idea. \u2018No\u2019 speaks about risk avoidance: most ideas are killed right after they are born.\n\nA \u2018Yes, and\u2019 approach removes excuses and the fear of making mistakes.\n\nSuccessful teams know how to improvise; they play like a Jazz band.\n\n\u2018Yes, and\u2019 is at the core of Improv Comedy.\n\nStandup comedians learn that one person is only so smart, or so original, for so long. The collective creativity is stronger than individual ideas.\n\nA \u2018Yes, and\u2019 mindset encourages a culture of abundance; saying \u2018No\u2019 promotes scarcity. Creativity is about finding more ways to make your party memorable.\n\nHere are some of the benefits.\n\nGeneration is more important than selection when running a brainstorm. You want participants to aim for quantity, not to filter their ideas because they are not good enough. There is a time to flare and a time to focus.\n\n\u2018And\u2019 is about adding. Each idea is a building block to create an amazing party. Each idea is a new spark; it ignites more ideas.\n\nRemember, creativity is about abundance, not scarcity. We are wired to choose options. What about combining two ideas? Or having two parties within one?\n\n\u2018No\u2019 and \u2018Yes, but\u2019 forces you to judge the work rather than contribute to the collective effort. When you are building, you are part of the team. There\u2019s no need to judge when you are co-creating with others.\n\nThe best teams embrace different perspectives. Group thinking is the opposite of creativity. Having people with different skills, abilities, perspectives, and walks of life makes ideas more interesting. Creativity is about connecting what seems unconnected, not about logic.\n\nCreativity is not the result of a mind but the byproduct of a culture of change.\n\nIf people can\u2019t have fun planning a party, don\u2019t expect great ideas at work. A \u2018Yes, and\u2019 gets rid of passive aggressive and judgmental behaviors \u2014 it unleashes collaboration and creativity.\n\nThe way a team plans a party defines how they play together.\n\nReflect: Are you a \u2018No,\u2019 a \u2018Yes, but\u2019 or a \u2018Yes, and\u2019 person?\n\nReceive my weekly \u201cInsights for Changemakers\u201d: Sign Up Now\n\nLearn how we liberate the \u2018creative gene\u2019 within everyone: Reach out"

        "text": "Medium Can Be the Pillar of Your Content Marketing Strategy\n\nI expect two groups to read this post.\n\nI\u2019m writing this post for the people who are at the intersection of both groups.\n\nSome people in the second group won\u2019t be interested in creating content in written format. As I explained in a previous post, some people are better at creating content in audio and video, and others in written form.\n\nThere\u2019s good news for both segments. Medium isn\u2019t a text-only platform anymore. It also serves audio. More about that later.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid of the people in the second group. It\u2019s the first group that I\u2019m scared of. Some people associate marketing with evil and hate everything about it.\n\nIn the past, marketing has been abused to get the most out of people\u2019s pockets without providing something significant in return. However, times are changing.\n\nThe New Wave of Marketing\n\nThere\u2019s a new wave of marketing. The new wave of marketing is enabling great work to sustain itself and reach its target audience who are willing to consume it.\n\nWhen I\u2019m writing about marketing, I\u2019m writing about the new wave of marketing, not about getting the most out of people\u2019s pockets.\n\nI\u2019m interested in building a business that provides as much value as possible to its customers and receives a fraction of that value in return. Marketing is a part of this business model.\n\nKeep Marketing out of Medium?\n\nThere\u2019s a notion that all marketing is terrible and it must be kept out of everything that\u2019s good, including Medium. I don\u2019t agree with that notion.\n\nNot all marketing is evil and decent marketing can enable great content on Medium. That\u2019s the topic of another post that I\u2019m going to publish tomorrow.\n\nIn this post, I want to focus on the value of Medium for content marketers. Among others, there are three reasons Medium is valuable for content marketers.\n\nThere are two types of social media platforms, content platforms and promotion platforms. Medium is a content platform.\n\nThat is good for consumers, and that\u2019s good for content producers as well. People can immediately see whether a content producer is worth their time or not.\n\nA content producer doesn\u2019t need to bother with promotion, which is a secondary activity anyway. That\u2019s why I focus on Medium as the single source of traffic for my blog.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to get your content consumed on Facebook.\n\nOn Facebook, you have to create convincing promotional posts, pay Facebook to boost those posts, and hope that some people click through to your actual content. In contrast, your Medium post is your actual content.\n\nThe average Facebook user will ignore anything longer than a few sentences or a few seconds. In my experience, 6\u20137 minutes long Medium posts perform the best.\n\nI consume content in two formats. When I have time, I read content in written form. Reading is an efficient way of consuming content. But I can\u2019t read a post when I\u2019m working out in the gym. Then, I listen to a podcast or an audiobook.\n\nMedium combines both formats, and this is an opportunity for you. I don\u2019t use this opportunity at the moment, but I don\u2019t underestimate it.\n\nSuppose that I follow you. I get stuck in a traffic jam. Instead of sitting there doing nothing, I can listen to your latest post, instead of waiting to arrive at home to read it.\n\nIf you record the audio versions of your posts, you can eventually broadcast them in a podcast or on YouTube as well.\n\nIn his last post, Ev Williams, the CEO of Medium, explained the changes they made to Medium\u2019s algorithm.\n\nThere are enough news sites that report about the recent events. There are enough books that provide evergreen content on timeless topics such as personal development.\n\nI also want to have something quick to read like a blog post on those timeless topics. Medium is meeting that need now. There aren\u2019t many major platforms that do that. Medium is distinguishing itself this way.\n\nWhat Are the Implications for Content Providers?\n\nIt\u2019s bad news, because your next post has to compete with the complete back catalog of Medium.\n\nIt\u2019s good news, because if your next post succeeds at this competition, it\u2019s going to pay dividends for the rest of your life.\n\nI prefer long-term value over short-term benefits. Medium\u2019s new algorithm favors this approach.\n\nYou better invest more time and effort in your next post so that you can reap its rewards for the rest of your life. If you don\u2019t, it won\u2019t produce any short-term benefits either.\n\n80% of My Post Views Come from Older Posts\n\nLast week, my Medium posts received 2701 views. 2134 of those views came from the posts that were older than a week.\n\nMedium\u2019s new algorithm will eliminate a lot of competition and make good work pay off. Our posts won\u2019t be archived after a few weeks and then forgotten.\n\nMedium is an excellent platform for content marketers who are willing to provide more value than they ask for.\n\nIf you post on Medium, you don\u2019t have to promote your content. There is an audience willing to read excellent blog posts. If you\u2019re good at blogging, your content finds its way to this audience.\n\nYou can include the audio versions of your posts on Medium and at least double your audience.\n\nThe new version of Medium\u2019s algorithm will eliminate a lot of competition, but there\u2019s a catch. You have to be willing to put in the time and effort, and be patient enough to wait for the long-term rewards.\n\nToday\u2019s post was about the positive sides of Medium. In tomorrow\u2019s post, I\u2019ll discuss the downside of Medium\u2019s business model and Ev William\u2019s vision.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check my post tomorrow.

        "title": "BlockChain Principle, Type & Application & Why You Should Care About It",
        "text": "BlockChain Principle, Type & Application & Why You Should Care About It\n\nBlockchain technology has become a new darling of this 21st century. But much before this technology came into existence there was a system of Digital Cash which was conceptualized by Chaum in 1983 to handle the concept of double spending, even though advanced cryptography existed at the time too, but it failed to be compatible with centralization, the anonymity of the transaction and double spending.\n\nSo three decades later in 2009 Satoshi came up with Bitcoin, a world\u2019s first decentralized currency, which replaced the digital cash centralized server signature mechanism, with a consensus based proof of work. It solved the issue of double spending and improvised the concept of Chaum\u2019s by introducing the decentralized payment system using revolutionary Blockchain technology.\n\nI would like to discuss the 5 underlying principle behind this tech of the future and how it can be utilized by techies to change the world in a bigger way.\n\nBlockchain is a P2P network where no single participant(user) controls the transaction, the power is distributed among all the participants in this network, that means no single stakeholder can hack,manipulate or close the chain of blocks or can shut it down. This blockchain network due to its distributed(Decentralized) mechanism is free from any hacks or fraud.\n\nIn the blockchain powered network all the participants have got the rights to make decisions, here the trust in the system is not forced but is totally guided by user intuition. The tight integrity is observed in the way every user gets incentivized for their effort and also in the way this entire P2P network function.\n\nBlockchain has been designed with this core principle to provide high levelof security and authenticity to the user. To ensure tightly knit security & data integrity it uses the power of cryptography. The Blockchain transaction mechanism is favorable & rewarding for an authentic user at the same time it is very harsh on reckless user. That means the blockchain system is fair for all who behave as a good user and reward them appropriately. But if you go about using it with wrong intent you are not spared and penalized.\n\nBlockchain being distributed network, there is no one central point of failure and also no single person can behave recklessly to damage the entire chain of network. The damage because of any individual hack of password will limit to that single person itself. With blockchain PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) encryption mechanism your transaction over the network is highly secured until you are a fool to share your private key for which no technology has a solution. So, largely you can trust on Blockahin technology to ensure your transactions gets completed without being hacked .\n\nThe Blockchain is inclusive in its approach where everyone is independent to participate without any discrimination in the global economy. The bitcoin allows all the richest, the poorest, to invest in their capacity and become part of this global economy, as the need to have a bank account was totally removed . They can directly decide to transact to whomsoever they want without third party intervention that too paying zero to very little transaction fee.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s main contribution to the world will be the inclusion of one and all to be a part of this global economy, which will be fair, safe, secure and just to all.\n\nIn a digital world, where consumers and businesses transact online for shopping, transferring payments & to verify information for a myriad of purposes, ensuring data privacy has become paramount. It\u2019s Strong Hash Key encryption is quite secure and helps you exchange data over the internet without disclosing your true identity.\n\nWith Blockchain your identity is never revealed while you transact using the blokchain P2P network.Your Rights and freedom is clear and enforceable, as you become part of the blockchain ecosystem. The Blockchain\u2019s Smart Contract is an awesome way to execute any agreement between two parties, which basically allow for transactions to go through only when certain predefined benchmarks have been reached and agreed upon both parties involved..\n\nNow that you have understood the underlying principle behind Blockchain let us understand the simplified explanation of blockchain as define by\n\nYou (a \u201cnode\u201d) have a file of transactions on your computer (a \u201cledger\u201d). Two government accountants (let\u2019s call them \u201cminers\u201d) have the same file on theirs (so it\u2019s \u201cdistributed\u201d). As you make a transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.\n\nEach accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary \u201cBitcoins\u201d). The first to check and validate hits \u201cREPLY ALL\u201d, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction (\u201cProof of Work\u201d). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file\u2026\n\nThis concept is enabled by \u201cBlockchain\u201d technology."

        "title": "7 Proven Steps Smart Entrepreneurs Take to Avoid Failure",
        "text": "In 1896, Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto stated a law which holds true in every aspect of life.\n\nFor instance, 20 percent issues cause 80 percent of your problems. In physical training, roughly 20 percent exercises have almost 80 percent impact.\n\nAround 20 percent customers contribute to almost 80 percent of a business\u2019 revenue. Microsoft noted that fixing 20 percent of the most reported bugs fixed 80 percent errors and crashes in a given system.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with startups, Small and Medium Enterprises, and Multinational Corporations for over six years. In this period, I\u2019ve figured out that certain actions (20 percent) yield rich rewards for every leader and entrepreneur. And I\u2019d like to share them with you.\n\nThese 7 actions will make you, the leader, standardize your business and scale it up without compromising on quality or your values.\n\nAccording to a report by CB Insights, no market need is the reason for over 42 percent businesses\u2019 failure.\n\nHow can you avoid being part of this unenviable group? By engaging with your most important customers: the 20 percent who contribute to 80 percent of your revenue.\n\nI asked a client whose business I was working on growing, why customers bought from him. The answers were clich\u00e9 \u2014 competitive (read \u2018cheap\u2019) prices even if it meant low quality goods.\n\nBut speaking to his top 15 percent customers presented a contrasting picture altogether. His top customers prioritized speed of delivery followed by quality. Professionalism ranked third and customization fourth. Price came a distant fifth.\n\nArmed with these insights, we went back to the drawing board and refined the client\u2019s business model. The result was a 63 percent jump in sales within a year.\n\nInvest your effort in identifying customers who\u2019ll pay for what you offer, and what they expect in return. Then delight them by offering what your competition doesn\u2019t.\n\nTakeaway: Approach your premium customers, ask them what they expect, and why. Accordingly, develop your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to delight them.\n\nDelegation is the shiny object that every entrepreneur chases. It makes her feel like she\u2019s in control of her company, like she has arrived.\n\nBut look closer at the chaos in the company and you\u2019ll find delegation at the root of it.\n\nIn the initial stage, you, the leader, must know the ins-and-outs of your business. Get your hands dirty. Avoid delegation.\n\nWhen your startup grows into a small enterprise, design processes to streamline each function. Your hands dirty will prove useful here, because you\u2019ll know how each function works optimally. You can delegate documentation and reports, but not decisions.\n\nWhen the enterprise turns into a self-running organization, you can delegate any task as long as you track the performance of the individual handling it.\n\nTakeaway: As a leader, stabilize your organization before scaling up. Get your hands dirty early on, and you\u2019ll enjoy remarkable success later.\n\nBut how will you find time to do so? By setting the right goals.\n\nImagine eight people rowing a boat, each steering it in a direction of their own choice. The rowers will break their backs, but the boat will go nowhere.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in most companies, and it\u2019s why they lose momentum.\n\nToday, knowledge workers lack indicators to quantify their productivity. As a result, they turn to an indicator from the industrial age: \u2018visible\u2019 work.\n\nAnswering emails, attending meetings, being online 24/7, and other \u2018visible work\u2019 is easy. But these tasks keep entrepreneurs busy in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole. All this does is burn them out.\n\nInstead, set wildly important goals (WIGs) in key areas which will make your company grow. These could include:\n\na.) customer satisfaction and retention,\n\nb.) fixing your MVP\u2019s bugs,\n\nc.) reducing turnaround times for delivery,\n\nd.) getting traction,\n\n\u2026 and so on.\n\nSet ambitious metrics for each WIG, and back them up with ambitious deadlines.\n\nWhen your team does the same, when everyone rows in the same direction, the boat will reach its destination faster and with less effort.\n\nTakeaway: Identify important actions for your company to succeed. Set WIGs and work towards them.\n\nHow will you identify the important factors which dictate your organization\u2019s success? By taking time off to ponder on them.\n\nIn 2006, Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis led a team to conduct an experiment. The aim was to detect whether actively working through a complex problem yielded better results, or whether shifting to other actions let the subconscious mind mull over the problem.\n\nThe team gave subjects information needed to solve a complex car purchase. Half the subjects had to go through the information and make the best decision. The others had to solve easy puzzles after reading the information. They were then put on the spot to make a decision without time to think. The distracted group performed better.\n\nRenowned music composer Steve Reich found that taking time off a problem helped him understand it better:\n\nBut time off doesn\u2019t mean multitasking or getting on social media. Instead, spend it with your family and friends, or pursue a hobby. Get bored.\n\nTakeaway: Give your mind a break. Let your subconscious mind sort through your most complex challenges.\n\nToo often, entrepreneurs focus on wrong problem. That\u2019s why those problems keep raising their ugly heads over and over again."

        "text": "With potential for both fame and fortune, a career in technology appeals to many.\n\nHowever, accessing this industry can often feel out of reach. Not only do the barriers to entry seem high, successful female role models are somewhat limited. The result? Many women aspiring to a career in tech don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nOver the years I have often found some of the best talent in technology to come from non-technical backgrounds. Many of the UK\u2019s most successful female entrepreneurs with multi-million pound tech businesses started out with humanities degrees.\n\nWhilst it might not be for everyone, working for a successful tech company can make waves for your professional profile. Those who do well can make the kind of impact that would take the equivalent of decades in more traditional industries where progression is often tied to years in service.\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve seen work well for many women, here are my top tips if you\u2019re looking to make a head start in tech.\n\nThanks to the recognition that we need more women working in the industry, there are many active communities designed to support the cause. Ada\u2019s List, DevelopHer and GeekGirlMeetUp can present a platform for being privy to the right kind of conversations, events and job opportunities. You don\u2019t need to be a coder or even already working for a tech company to get involved. Try to offer people something first (even if it\u2019s just energy and enthusiasm) to help your requests go further.\n\nLike most industries, who you know does indeed matter. If you can become friendly with well-connected or influential people, the right doors will open. Tech is such a dynamic industry where people buy people. You can get far by showing genuine interest in those who might become future mentors, coaches or employers. Show you\u2019ve done your homework and make your requests easy for people to action. The author Ryan Holiday has great tips for this. Put yourself out there by attending events, contacting people through LinkedIn & Twitter or asking your existing network for warm intros.\n\nImpress employers by going out of your way to learn the fundamentals of technology. The range of courses available has made learning more accessible than ever. By taking a hands-on approach you\u2019ll stand out from the competition in no time. Consider training such as: 23Code Street (where you\u2019ll in turn help women in developing countries), Makers Academy (which guarantees future employment for its graduates) or lighter touch options like General Assembly evening classes or learning online.\n\nIf you want to dip your toe in tech/entrepreneurship there are ways to do so on the side. Training like Digital Mums offers the chance to create social media businesses from home. There are plenty of online platforms for developing your skills in exchange for money on the side in a low risk environment. Places like PeoplePerHour and Guru can help you to build a portfolio in skills such as web development or design. You can even trade an existing skill (e.g. baking) for someone else\u2019s (e.g. coding) through schemes including Echo where there is no cash exchanged at all!\n\nThere\u2019s huge value in creating an online presence to showcase your skills, passion projects you\u2019ve worked on or testimonials from clients. Even if these sides of you don\u2019t feel related to technology per se. Consider showing off sides of you that potential employers might find attractive. And get creative. It might be that your experience working in fashion gives you the kind of customer experience credentials that a B2C digital business building its audience needs. Keep your Twitter and LinkedIn profiles up to date \u2013 sharing and liking relevant content is key. Creating an online CV or website will also help you stand out from the crowd. Writing on Medium is a great way to grow your following if you\u2019re just starting out, and you can always redirect viewers on there to other platforms you\u2019ve created.\n\nIt really is possible to land a role both outside your experience level and at highly sought after companies. It all relies on doing the right things at the right time. Stories of people sending handwritten letters, doing free work and jumping on a plane a the last minute to meet a potential employer, have been shown to be successful. An early Airbnb employee (now a senior executive for the business) began by creating a report on suggested tweaks for the making the user experience more intuitive. This kind of project would have taken weeks \u2013 with no guaranteed results \u2013 but it secured the attention she needed. Hustling is about knowing the target company really well, making yourself stand out as a human (not just a CV) and being proactive and persistent \u2013 without becoming a stalker."

        "text": "We\u2019re forever being told that we have to find a niche and stick to it. It cuts out a lot of the competition, it keeps us focused, and it will attract more clients.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with any of this. After all, it\u2019s better to be a master at one thing than average at many things.\n\nEvery article I\u2019ve seen on the subject has defined a niche as being a particular skill or industry. If you\u2019re a writer, for example, you could choose to specialise in web copy or article writing, or you could only write for businesses within the tech industry.\n\nAlthough this is a perfectly acceptable way to pick your niche, it can also be a pretty simplistic and narrow way of defining what your business does.\n\nThere are lots of ways to form a niche and a solid brand image without having to abandon other industries that you like working in and services that you enjoy doing.\n\nI want to go through a few ways to define your niche without working on one thing for the rest of your life (and dying of boredom along the way).\n\nAre you particularly good at getting quality work done to tight deadlines? Your niche could be that you can turnaround jobs in just a few days.\n\nHave you found a particularly innovative and simple way to keep clients up-to-date while working with them? Your niche could be that your communication with clients is superb.\n\nDo you carry out an extra service for every client for no extra charge? Your niche could be that you go the extra mile for your clients in a way others don\u2019t.\n\nWhether you do this using creativity, speed, extra hours, or something else, there\u2019s just something special about the way you get stuff done."

        "title": "How to talk to a company about blockchain: the IBM Hyperledger example \u2014 2/2",
        "text": "In the first article of this mini-series we proposed a possible approach for the presentation of blockchain technology to companies.\n\nNow let\u2019s go down more in detail. There are several solutions to implement corporate blockchains. Hyperledger is an open source meta-project under the aegis of the Linux Foundation which aims to create interoperable cross-industry blockchain technologies. There are several variations including Sawtooth and Iroha, each with unique features and functionality. Another meta-project, not open source, for the development of business blockchain is R3 consortium Corda framework.\n\nFor this introduction I chose the IBM solution, which consists of two modules operating at different levels, Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nHyperledger Composer is a suite of high-level applications that makes it possible to design a business network; the terminology used is linked to the world of business, commerce and companies, making this first modeling phase simpler and faster.\n\nIt starts from the real structure of the business network that revolves around a company: it creates a model that is developed and tested, using API and REST architecture to dialogue with other business systems.\n\nThe Hyperledger Composer architecture provides four modules that will be integrated into a final file with the extension .bna. This file will be the input and model for Hyperledger Fabric, the real blockchain system.\n\nThe modules are:\n\n- Model file, contains definitions and characteristics of participants, assets and transactions: The three key entities of a business network. It is the responsibility of the Business Analyst.\n\n- Access Control, which defines the different types and levels of permissions for different participants.\n\n- Script file, essentially contains the codes to perform the transactions. It is the responsibility of the developers.\n\n- Query file, implements the different types of queries that can be made to read the data recorded in the blockchain.\n\nLet\u2019s take a simple example of designing a business network, just to clarify the ideas.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the chocolate production supply chain.\n\nParticipants in our network are:\n\nAssets are anything that has value and can be transferred from one participant to another.\n\nObviously the cocoa beans are an asset, but there are others. An expedition is an asset (which can \u201cembedded\u201d cocoa beans); an asset is a contract between the importer and the confectionery company for the purchase and delivery of a batch of cocoa beans.\n\nA \u201ccontract\u201d asset can be identified by these parameters and be linked to these participants:\n\nOther parameters may be present, such as the permissible temperature range during transport. The temperature is detected through the sensors during the journey, on ships, on trucks, etc.: These data are transmitted to the blockchain.If the limits established and written in the asset code are exceeded, the shipper will automatically pay a penalty.\n\nA shipment can have these parameters and must be linked to the other asset, the contract.\n\nUnlike a public blockchain, not all participants have access to any information. Transporters can not access transaction data between importers and growers. And the forwarder are not authorized to view transaction data between importer and shippers.\n\nTransactions, written in the Script file, contain instructions for managing and completing a transaction, payments and any ancillary clauses such as penalties. In practice, it is a series of \u201cif it happens A execute B otherwise execute C\u201d.\n\nIt is important to understand how the steps that are traditionally accompanied by a purchase and a shipment are managed automatically by blockchain in a single \u201cenvironment\u201d common to all the parties involved. This automation can be upgraded if you use IoT tools or anyway devices able to talk to each other through mobile, wi-fi, NFC, bluetooth.\n\nWe can also assume that there are other participants with supervisory or control functions. If the business network joins to fair trade rules, a supervisor may be authorized to view asset-contracts and transactions between growers and importer to check that there is adequate payment. A government agency could read the blockchain in the context of monitoring imports from particular countries. A quality consortium would verify the origin area of cocoa beans and transport conditions. All these participants could be blockchain nodes, although they probably would not be block endorser, as we\u2019ll see shortly."

        "title": "My Journey Of Building A SaaS Startup in 2018 \u2014 Part One",
        "text": "I have a great job as a mobile software developer, I\u2019m not rich, but I have a good, stable income, a great sister, a fantastic girlfriend and two healthy parents that are very supportive with everything that I choose to do even if they are far away from me.\n\nWhy would I want to start this journey that will disturb my life with a lot of ups and downs that will happen in the next following years?\n\nIf you guys don\u2019t know what I\u2019m building, please read my first post HERE\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the definition of every entrepreneur, but I will tell you \u201cmy why\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s something that comes from inside; it\u2019s passion, it\u2019s the desire of building something and releasing it to the world. There isn\u2019t a day that it passes without me thinking about having my own business.\n\nI have a few apps on Google Play ( which are Free ), and I\u2019m so happy when someone leaves me a review saying that it helped them a lot.\n\nI\u2019m so excited about creating Netcrumb that I have evenings when I go to bed and I\u2019m not able to disconnect, and I hardly fall asleep because I think of what features I can add on top of what I\u2019m already building.\n\nI know it is not right, but I think that every entrepreneur has this.\n\nWhen they go to a shop, because some friend told them that it has the best orange juice, they do not thoroughly enjoy their drink.\n\nEntrepreneurs think of how much money that shop is making. Can he/she find a better way to make that orange juice? You got my idea\u2026\n\nOf course, everyone wants to make money, and that\u2019s the final goal, but before that, other accomplishments make us happy.\n\nEvery entrepreneur dreams big. Even if they start with just a coffee shop, they still dream of having 100 coffee shops around the world after a few years.\n\nMy friends can confirm the number of times I was excited about something, and then I would abandon it.\n\nEven though I still built a few things in the past ten years. I can\u2019t call any of them success as none is bringing in any revenue ( maybe under $100 ) and considering the amount of time I put to release those, I would say they are somewhat failures.\n\nNow coming back to all the ideas I had in my mind, I didn\u2019t consider any of them being the ONE.\n\nWhen you propose your girlfriend you know that you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life with her.\n\nSame with an idea. I had a lot of them, but none that would make me \u201cmarry\u201d it. None that would make me feel what I wrote above about Netcrumb ( That\u2019s quite a declaration. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s making my girlfriend jealous. )\n\nWhat I want to say is that when the perfect idea comes, you will feel it, this is what happened to me last year.\n\nIt was maybe October or November, I was browsing through different pages, and as always ideas were flowing through my mind, till one came.\n\nAll these recruiters that message me on Linkedin, they send the same messages over and over again, and I\u2019m not sure if they have something or it is click bait.\n\nDon\u2019t understand me wrong, I have nothing against recruiters, and they helped me a lot through my career, and I want to thank them. But like in any industry, some people do their job better than others.\n\nOk, Dragos, but what all this have to do with Netcrumb?\n\nIt might sound crazy, but the idea I\u2019m building now started from here, and I pivoted.\n\nRight after I had those thoughts, I messaged some recruiter friends, and I\u2019ve asked them about why they don\u2019t make beautiful landing pages for each job they have.\n\nWhile talking about this, they told me that this is not a big issue. The problem that recruiters have is with people creating their CVs.\n\nFor a few days, I had in my mind this idea of how I can help people creating their CVs, but tons of software can do that, and of course, I abandoned the idea.\n\nAt this point, I still thought that creating great landing pages for jobs is excellent even if the feedback was not the best from recruiters. I know, sometimes I\u2019m stubborn.\n\nA few days later after still thinking of how I can create such a service I tell myself.\n\nGuess what? I don\u2019t remember precisely the day, but I was doing my usual Product Hunt daily visit when I saw it. It was number one for that day, the same idea that I had and it was beautiful, the best website builder I have seen until that day.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I should tell its name, as somehow it is a competitor, but in the end, it is a great tool, and I want to make my web application better. I do not care about the competition. The web application is called Launchaco.\n\nThe first thing that came to my mind \u201cThis is such a strange coincidence\u201d.\n\nWhen I thought that I found the perfect idea that I want to work on, somebody else launched it. Later I discovered that this was Launchaco\u2019s second version and they released the product one year before.\n\nI had all these thoughts for a few days till I realised one thing.\n\nWhat about Wordpress Dragos? You\u2019ve created a lot of websites on Wordpress, and all the builders you\u2019ve worked with are very hard to use.\n\nWhat if you could make a Wordpress theme generator that will create a website instantly with a beautiful responsive design rather than searching for a theme, installing it, learning to use their builder and so on.\n\nAnd this is how it started.\n\nI had the idea and everything in my mind.\n\nI\u2019ve started to look on potential competitors, check all the builders and see how they work.\n\nNone was doing what I had in mind.\n\nI started talking with people, and they shared the same idea regarding how you can build Wordpress websites: you can buy a theme, install and try to customise it ( you need some design skills too ) or you can hire a developer that will do everything for you.\n\nThe difference in the budget is significant.\n\nThe first way is cheap, maybe $100-$200 plus hosting and domain and the second one is expensive, maybe over $1000 for a simple Wordpress website.\n\nI knew my idea would work and the next thing I wondered: \u201cCan I validate it?\u201d\n\nWhat would be the minimum viable product that I need to launch so I can test all the assumptions that I have, and which other users confirmed?\n\nThe answer came pretty fast. I\u2019m joking. It took me a few days.\n\nI decided to build a web application that will prove everything that I have in my head.\n\nOf course, the first release will not have all the features available, and it will be far from perfect, but I want it to bring value. The feedback from my future customers will make it stunning.\n\nNow that I had an idea and a decision I needed to start working on the actual product.\n\nBuilding it myself or paying some guys to do it.\n\nI\u2019m an Android mobile developer, which means that my skills are with Java \u2014 Android, but these two wouldn\u2019t be the ones I need to build the project.\n\nCan I learn all the other programming languages that I need to build Netcrumb ( Javascript and PHP )? Of course, I could, but how much time it would take? Maybe 1\u20132 years and I would still not be good enough to make such an application.\n\nSo I went for the second choice. Hiring some other guys to do it and I will help them where I can, and I know.\n\nThe decision was easy, but I didn\u2019t have all the money I needed for such an app.\n\nI started to calculate how much it will cost a first version of the product.\n\nFirst I thought about the number of hours needed and then the hourly rates available on the market.\n\nI calculated that if I find some developers that will work for $40-$50 per hour, then it will cost me a maximum of $30,000.\n\nI\u2019ve looked into getting a loan, and I found Virgin Start-up. They offer up to 25,000 GBP for 6.2% fix interest, you owe 100% of the company, but you have to pay monthly repayments. This loan is only for United Kingdom startups, and it comes with free mentoring support and other significant benefits. It is a good option, but the idea of getting 25k and then paying every month around 500 GBP was a bit too risky. I thought that this will be considered my last choice.\n\nNext thing I did, I applied for an accelerator. I found it by mistake, and it was for Romanian entrepreneurs. The only thing I had was just an idea, but they said that they would fund ideas and existing businesses. If they had chosen you they would give 25k EUR for 7% of the company and next; they could offer you up to another 100k EUR for another % of the company.\n\nI prepared my application for a few days, but apparently, they didn\u2019t choose me. They decided to pick only existing businesses.\n\nWhile all this happened, I spoke with my sister with excitement about what I want to create. I was telling her how I want to do it and what problem I\u2019m solving. She probably saw the passion in my eyes, because after one month she said to me that she wants to help me build this thing for a percentage of the company ( 10% ) and to refund her money once I can.\n\nGreat news. I knew I have to find some developers.\n\nI\u2019m a developer myself, and I never thought that it is that hard to find an agency or some developers to make you a web application. I imagine how difficult it is for someone with no knowledge in the field.\n\nFirst I wanted to hire separate developers to do bits from the app, and in the end, I would connect it, but this was a bad idea.\n\nI needed a small agency, that doesn\u2019t have huge rates and can help me build my MVP.\n\nI started looking on Upwork because if I would work through Upwork then they will try to do an excellent job as nobody wants terrible reviews and I\u2019ve looked and looked and found agencies from Ukraine and Russia with the rates I wanted.\n\nFound a few agencies and I searched for them on Google so that I can contact them directly, but in the end, work through Upwork.\n\nI got a few emails back, and even Skype calls, but most of them didn\u2019t understand what I want to build or their quotes were huge for what I explained I wanted. I got even estimations of 200\u2013300k GBP.\n\nA lot of them stopped answering my emails, they probably didn\u2019t think I was serious, but this is life.\n\nWhile I was doing all these things, a great Romanian developer invited me on Facebook to like a new page. It was a new development agency he had with another great guy.\n\nI met him right before he moved to Dublin for about two years to work as a software developer, but now he was back in Bucharest.\n\nI sent him a message on Facebook, and we discussed. I told him about my idea, and then I had a few calls with him and his partner on Skype, and they understood my plan precisely. They knew what I wanted to build and in the following days, they gave me an estimation of around 19,000 EUR.\n\nLater on, we signed the contract on 30th of March, but actually for 16,000 EUR as I removed some features from the first version of the product.\n\nI know it\u2019s not much and I know that in London or San Francisco it could have cost me 100k or more, but it\u2019s just a start, and I\u2019m pretty sure that if they will help me build the product that I want, I will bring them more work and more revenue.\n\nI don\u2019t want to disclose their company name for the moment, but if they do an excellent job for me, then you will find it out.\n\nWe signed the contract for three months, but I know that it will take 4\u20135 months to release the BETA version.\n\nIf you want to follow me along while I\u2019m building my SaaS startup and being the first one to know when Netcrumb releases the first version, then subscribe in the form below.\n\nIn the next part, I\u2019m going to write about what we did in the first month."

        "text": "Less than 24 hours later, I\u2019m breaking French bread with a Parisian client as she recounts how her office becomes a ghost town every May.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like August in there,\u201d she offhandedly remarks; my American-born mind marveling that the closest representation she can conjure up is the other month in the year where no one shows up to work.\n\nThe reason for the mass exodus, she continues, is that the French by law are required to use up their PTO by May 31st each year. \u201cIn rare cases people can negotiate a carry-over,\u201d she explains. \u201cMost people, however, just have to use it up by May or lose it.\u201d\n\nFortunately, using PTO for the French is as popular a national pastime as not taking PTO in the States. As recently reported by the U.S. Travel Association, Americans left a record 662 million vacation days unused in 2016.\n\nAll opinions on workplace best practices aside, the research shows just how differently these two countries think when handling paid leave. Below is a graph from The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) depicting the minimum amount of vacation time employers are required to offer (by country):\n\nI\u2019ve seen differing reports on France\u2019s official minimum annual leave ranging between 25 and 30 days and between 1 and 10 paid holidays. Then you have to keep in mind that this is the minimum allowance. As my Parisian client was quick to point out, \u201cMany people have more than the five weeks. I have a good friend for example that accumulates an additional two days per month.\u201d Doing the math quickly, that comes out to about 10 weeks of PTO per year.\n\nThere\u2019s no inconsistency however when it comes to the United States\u2019 official PTO policy for employers. It\u2019s a big, fat, ugly zero. Unfortunate side note, of the 35 member countries in the OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), which represents the far majority of the world\u2019s most advanced economies, the United States is the only nation that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation.\n\nThis means that my best friend Jim, with his MBA and C-level office accommodations, is guaranteed 30 times less paid vacation than the entry-level cashier at my village boulangerie in France. It\u2019s nuts, but true. I checked with her this afternoon just to be sure. She\u2019s a student that works Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays mornings yet still is guaranteed five weeks paid time off.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this type of discrepancy has an impact on work-life balance. France offers its workers a \u201cTop 3\u201d work-life balance ranking within the OECD:\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, manages to pull up the backend of the index, sharing a \u201cWorst 10\u201d ranking with countries like Turkey, Mexico, and Latvia (notice Latvia scores higher, BTW):\n\nWith the ranking comes a host of other nasty side-effects, as noted by Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business, in his new book Dying for a Paycheck:\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to imagine that poor workplace policies can result in premature death, but that\u2019s only because in the United States we\u2019ve yet as a culture to develop a clear link between working days, stress, and longevity.\n\nThis is by no means a clear example of why the French model is universally superior. It does however point to a willingness to focus on the well-being of the individual over the well-being of the organization, which is something I doubt will take hold in the States any time soon.\n\nIn the meantime, you might consider taking an entry-level cashier position in my village\u2019s boulangerie.\n\nBegin today to eliminate the fear of stagnation and add more purpose to your life. I\u2019ll share how to make your dreams of living abroad a long-term reality.\n\nDon\u2019t get stuck wondering \u201cwhat if..\u201d \u2014 sign up for my weekly newsletter today!"

        "title": "Why Startup Founders Should Never Hire Their Friends",
        "text": "Why Startup Founders Should Never Hire Their Friends\n\nPeople say you should never hire your friends.\n\nFor startups, I\u2019d double down on that piece of advice.\n\nIf you\u2019re splitting a venture 50/50 between you and a friend, that means you\u2019re going into business together as co-founders. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that kind of partnership.\n\nBut a lot of founders then make the mistake of hiring their friends.\n\nIn the early stages of a startup, you\u2019re making wagers on the people you hire. You\u2019re betting they have what it takes to move the venture forward and make the venture look attractive.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-risk bet, but it\u2019s easier to make wagers on your friends. You know their character and you feel comfortable with them, so you don\u2019t cast as critical an eye on what they really bring to the table.\n\nTrust me, I\u2019ve been guilty of this more than once.\n\nThere are a few reasons why:\n\nIt might hurt to hear this, but it\u2019s true.\n\nI hired a buddy early on for my second startup, Washlava. He certainly contributed to the concept development and the seed stage by giving us a robust financial model that worked. We kept raising money, so I felt good about bringing him on.\n\nBut once we began to get into the details, things went sideways. The closer we got to actual implementation, the less he had to offer, the less motivated he got, the more afraid he became.\n\nWhich would have been fine. But I had given him 10% of the company, and it started getting frustrating because nothing was happening. His capabilities to move the company forward were maxed out. Eventually, he told me he was quitting.\n\nThere is no quitting in startups, period.\n\nThe truth is, some of your friends just aren\u2019t built for startups. They\u2019re used to having people tell them what to do. Or they\u2019ve become very good at doing one thing, and they aren\u2019t willing or able to learn something new.\n\nSome people can set up great models, strategies, or presentations. But it takes a different kind of person to build a company.\n\nHonestly, no one knows their friends as well as they think they do.\n\nFounders often assume their friends will have the same commitment to the startup. The reality is usually very different.\n\nThe friends I\u2019ve worked with at different ventures didn\u2019t view the opportunity the same way I did. It was speculative for them. They saw it as something they could walk away from if they wanted to. But perseverance is everything in a startup. You can\u2019t have people around who aren\u2019t pulling their weight. And you definitely can\u2019t have people quitting.\n\nYour friends are not bad people. But your relationship with them influences how they see the venture. They assume because you both go way back, it\u2019ll be fine if they slack off or quit.\n\nBut people you aren\u2019t friends with don\u2019t play around that way. They don\u2019t assume there\u2019s a bunch of wiggle room for them to quit doing their job. I have employees who have a 2% stake in the company doing much more than the guy who was given 10%.\n\nQuitting materially hurts the venture. It leaves you with less gunpowder to sell to other investors or reward the people who are working hard. You\u2019re going to think about it every time you see their name on the cap table.\n\nAnd so will investors. When VCs see a random name in a top 10 position on your cap table, they\u2019re going to ask you who that is.\n\nWhat are you going to say? \u201cHe\u2019s a wholly unqualified buddy of mine that I hired early on.\u201d You have to work hard to be taken seriously after that.\n\nFirst, avoid bias when it comes to hiring friends and making decisions about equity. Don\u2019t overvalue what they bring to the table just because you like them.\n\nSecond, make sure they understand how a startup works and what\u2019s expected of them. Don\u2019t assume people who haven\u2019t been in startups understand what\u2019s involved. Make sure you\u2019ve explained the whole journey to them, both the business and what it means to you personally.\n\nFinally, make it clear that they cannot quit. Make it a condition of their equity \u2014 do whatever you have to \u2014 but make them understand they\u2019re in it for the long haul.\n\nYour friends are good to lean on when you have doubts and need some reassurance. But unless they have solid startup experience, it\u2019s best to keep work and friendships separate."

        "text": "The Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury (FSTB) has established that cryptocurrencies represent a medium-low risk in terms of money laundering and financing of terrorism. The findings were based on a report, titled Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report, which was recently published. While a risk connecting illicit activities and cryptocurrencies was present, it was classified as not significant. According to the document, an investigation on ICOs and cryptocurrencies is currently taking place. Furthermore, it is believed that one of the reasons for a weaker demand for cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong is its free market, along with strong foreign exchange market.\n\nBack in December, we reported that the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) would adopt blockchain technology to clear and settle its trades. The exchange is now going to replace its current Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with the FinTech company Digital Asset\u2019s (DA) distributed ledger technology (DLT), which is in charge of the technical side of the project. A blockchain-based post-trade system is going to be launched between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. A public consultation paper detailing the features of the new system, as well as the implementation period, has also been released. According to the report \u201cthe new system will allow settlement participants on both sides of a bilateral transaction to pre-match the transaction earlier in the settlement period without committing the transaction for settlement\u201d.\n\n3. CTFC Rules Are Too Old To Be Applied To Crypto, Says Chairman\n\nChris Giancarlo, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman, has stated that the independent agency\u2019s rules are too old to be applied to crypto. CFTC\u2019s rules were created in 1935, and this could mean that decades will pass before they can be used to create a crypto regulatory framework on the federal level. Giancarlo also acknowledged the success of local exchanges CBOE and CME at offering Bitcoin futures contracts. He went on to say that there is some interest within the Congress and the Senate to look into the new technology and create the right set of regulations for it. Therefore, the situation might change in the future. The chairman shared his thoughts during a video interview with CNBC.\n\nIran\u2019s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Minister Mohammad Azari-Jahromi has announced that the country state cryptocurrency is currently in experimental mode. We first reported on the country\u2019s plan to issue its own cryptocurrency in collaboration with the Post Bank of Iran in February. It has now been confirmed that they will introduce a pilot model to the banking system of the country. Despite the lack of details available, many are looking closely at the progress of the project due to fear of possible US sanctions. The uncertainty has already negatively affected the local currency, the Iranian rial."

        "text": "Unlock the Expert Advice From these 10 Authors to Improve Your Life\n\nAlthough a real life mentor might be a huge asset for your personal improvements, I would actually argue that books might sometimes be better.\n\nYou can consume all these different mentorships from books more efficiently than if you were just stuck with the one Yoda.\n\nAnd with the Kindle, it\u2019s easier than ever to find books that you\u2019re interested in. The Kindle is probably my favorite electronic device because it doesn\u2019t have any distractions. It\u2019s just for reading. Not for wasting time on Facebook and checking email. It makes you focus on actually consuming information that (hopefully, given that you\u2019re picking the right books) makes you smarter.\n\nHere are the 10 books that have changed my life, business, income and lifestyle for the better.\n\nI could give you so many more recommendations if I really dove back into history but these are the most recent ones that have given me the most wins.\n\nPay it forward by sharing your favorite books in the comments below.\n\nThis is a short read packed with great guiding principles on how to be a successful business person.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those books I buy, read, and then give to somebody I think should read it.\n\nThen I buy it again next year to read it anew. Rinse and repeat.\n\nRamit can be a hard-ass but I enjoy no BS tough love when it comes to improvement.\n\nMy favorite thing that I took from this book was automating my finances, especially when it comes to saving and investing. I basically thought about setting up a simple system for saving for retirement for about an hour a few years ago and since then it\u2019s been chugging along in the background.\n\nThis is a great book on productivity. It simplifies everything into focusing on only the one thing that\u2019s most important at each time.\n\nIt\u2019ll skyrocket your productivity and transform how you structure your work day.\n\nThis is the book that started it all.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for Mr. Tim Ferriss my life would\u2019ve been relegated to low income jobs and a boring life. Instead, I\u2019m successfully self-employed and get to do what I want to do every day. Pretty good trade-off just for reading one book.\n\nI want to call this the blue-collar method to creativity.\n\nBasically you just focus on doing the work as a habit and a ritual every day.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished a project you get up the next day and start a new one.\n\nA very interesting read about one man\u2019s introduction to meditation and mindfulness.\n\nI only mediate 10 minutes a day but it\u2019s been crucial in keeping me sane.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe why this book is good.\n\nIt\u2019s \u2019inspirational in many ways, and includes a lot of stories about individuals that became masters in their field. I need to read/listen to it again\n\nI was originally going to put \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d by Dale Carnegie on here but I think this one is better.\n\nIf somebody updated Carnegie\u2019s book for the new generation, this would be it.\n\nIt\u2019s a really easy read (with a foreword by Steven Pressfield!) but it encapsulates why it\u2019s pointless to try to please everyone all the time.\n\nI have my thing and I know there\u2019s an audience that likes what I\u2019m about.

        "text": "I\u2019ve made a habit in life of constantly looking forwards and analysing the coming days, weeks and months. I scan the horizon for potentially bad, hectic or unpleasant days and then mentally label them as hurdles to overcome before I can allow myself to enjoy life again. I also pick out the days that look appealing in prospect and mark those with notional goalposts. The theory seems to be that if I can just weather the bad days and get to the good days, then everything will be alright.\n\nI did this as a child too. On a Sunday evening I\u2019d feel the customary fear and mild desolation as I felt the weekend ebbing away behind me, and as I contemplated the week ahead. I\u2019d figure out which days I liked the look of least, the lesson with a teacher I found scary, a forthcoming test, a cross-country run or swimming lesson both of which would be endured in the hope of avoiding humiliation. I\u2019d map out the things I had to get through, and fixate on the next weekend as the point at which I could enjoy life again.\n\nMany kids likely do the same, but I suspect, more troubling, many adults do too. I\u2019m only just about managing to train myself to abandon the habit.\n\nAnd it is a habit, one that\u2019s wasteful and corrosive.\n\nWhat are we waiting for? Life is happening now. Today is all there is.\n\nThe poet and stoic philosopher Heraclitus put forward the notion that \u201cone day is equal to every day\u201d. No single day is inherently better or worse than any other. If we can give each day our full attention, effort and appreciation then by doing so we have the power to string together a series of positive days and live a happy and fulfilled life. Happiness and fulfilment notionally come from having given each day all that we could.\n\nIt seems simple and obvious to aspire to enjoy life one day at a time, to live your best life possible one day at a time. Instead, many lead a life of delayed-gratification, of anxious or excited anticipation of notional points in the future that we\u2019ve labelled either good or bad.\n\nHow many days are written-off as we use up oxygen while nervously waiting to get past an anticipated bad day? How many days do we fail to appreciate in their own right as we look forwards and wait for the notional good-day to come?\n\nI wear a ring, my only item of jewellery besides my wedding ring; my grandfather\u2019s wedding ring. It was given to me by my mother after she\u2019d had it engraved with the above quote, taken in this context from The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.\n\nIt reminds me each time that I look down at my hand that this moment, right here, right now is what life is about. It\u2019s all that life is about.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m flippant or negligent in the decisions I take and the things that I do, or that I operate in oblivious ignorance to the effects of my actions now for their future consequence. I don\u2019t dodge work and go on crazy adventures or blast money on indulgent impulse purchases while telling myself that tomorrow I might be dead. I maintain my sense of purpose about life and am committed to achieving long term as well as short term goals.\n\nI\u2019m constantly trying to remind myself that I cannot and should not lose sight of enjoying the moment, treasuring the process as much as the notional end-state. In remembering this, I am constantly trying to keep myself grounded in the present, focused and grateful for where I am and what I\u2019m doing.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but then what is.\n\nWhen we treat some days as incidental and just something to get through on the journey to where we think we\u2019re going, we deny ourselves of a valuable opportunity to actually live our life.\n\nWhen you look back in years to come, and reflect upon success or failure it will be impossible to determine which single day was responsible for the result. Progress or lack thereof is made by the compounding of many little things. It\u2019s a composite of the outcomes from many different actions, the effects of numerous decisions, thoughts and conversations. It\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the moment at which things that changed and when success or failure was determined.\n\nA single investment in bitcoin may have made someone a multi-millionaire overnight. They may claim the moment they placed that trade as the point at which everything changed. What about the time they invested in learning about trading and cryptocurrency? The days spent earning the money to invest? The inquisitiveness they developed through the course of their life that led them to explore developments in technology? All of these micro-moments, decisions and actions led them to that so-called defining moment.\n\nA car crash on the way to work may be blamed for ruining someone\u2019s year as they deal with the aftermath and the rehabilitation. The choices they made to that point, the time they got up, left the house, the place they work, the career they chose, the effort they applied in education, all of these contributed to putting that person in that place at that time. The crash itself was significant, but many other events conspired to put the person in that car in that moment.\n\nSuccesses and failures are a gradual accumulation of the many things that happen both within our control and in the environment around us. We can\u2019t control what the financial markets do, or whether another driver runs a red light. It\u2019s too flippant however, to surrender control of all the many other ways in which we can make an impact towards our own life and shape the quality of our lives and our destiny.\n\nIt starts by choosing to treat every day as an opportunity to make a difference. It starts by living each moment like it counts. Because it does!\n\nA flourishing and successful business isn\u2019t created in a single day, but as a gradual accumulation of successes and learning from failures. It\u2019s the result of carefully planned strategies, well executed tactics and a liberal and regular application of effort over a long period of time.\n\nA loving and supportive relationship isn\u2019t the result of the occasional bunch of flowers, a seduction or a kindly word. Instead it\u2019s forged over time through ongoing kindness, compassion, vulnerability and putting the needs of someone else ahead of your own.\n\nA beach-ready body isn\u2019t achieved through a crash diet and a couple of crippling sessions in the gym but rather as a result of steady, repeated and regular lifestyle changes.\n\nTo fixate on the end-point and remain selectively oblivious to the many steps that compound together to result in its achievement, is a sure-fire path to dissatisfaction and despondency.\n\nThe stoics used the expression memento mori. Ancient Buddhist texts refer to maranasati. Whatever you wish to refer to it as, it\u2019s helpful to remember that sooner or later we\u2019re all going to die. It might be today, tomorrow or at some point in the distant future, but death comes to us all. It would be as well for you to live acknowledging this point rather than operating under some delusion of invulnerability, picking and choosing whether to value each moment that life presents to you.\n\nAnchoring your appreciation of life to some notional point in the future is wasteful of the days up to that point. Holding back from your efforts or failing to invest yourself fully in today because you think it won\u2019t matter in the scheme of things is negligent. You\u2019re denying yourself the opportunity to get the most out of today, and you\u2019re blinding yourself to the notion that the better tomorrow may never come.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds morbid, but it is what it is. Ryan Holiday, author of and modern-day guru of stoicism puts it better than I ever will:\n\nWherever we look there are cues that encourage us towards appreciating and investing ourselves fully in each and every day. The sentiments may vary, whether they originate from ancient philosophers, religious doctrine, or music lyrics but the guidance is universal.\n\nA life well-lived is a culmination of a lot of days well-lived. A retrospective analysis of a life will not focus purely on the end-state, but on the sum of the accomplishments of the entire life, of the many victories and losses and the many days lived along the way.\n\nTo seize the day, to live for the moment and to aspire to win each day are heart-warming and inspirational notions. The sentiment behind them is certainly not (in my opinion) that we should live without regard for the consequences of our actions, for tomorrow may never come. Instead, I like to think that the message is firmly that today, and every day we must ensure that we take the action, make the mark and extract every moment of joy that we can, in case we don\u2019t have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.\n\nToby Hazlewood is an author, parent, husband, project manager, entrepreneur and in his spare time, cycling enthusiast.\n\nAs founder of the Kintsugi-Life movement, he advocates treating times of hardship, challenge and adversity as an opportunity not just to survive or recover, but as a prompt to grow and strengthen, equipping ourselves to live a better, more fulfilled and successful life.\n\nYou can learn more about Kintsugi Life and receive a free video overview describing the Kintsugi Life concept, here\n\nYou can access tools, products, services and insight via Facebook.com/kintsugilifestyle, Facebook.com/divorcedlifestyledesigner or kintsugilife.co"

        "text": "GDPR, The General Data Protection Regulation will come into force in less than a month. This regulation update will not only affect organisations in the EU, as long as your business serves customers who are EU citizens, your business will also be affected. If non-compliance with GDPR is discovered, the penalty will be severe \u2014 \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual turnover, whichever is higher.\n\nThis regulation update sounds like an adversity to lots of marketers. Due to the GDPR, businesses need to obtain clear consent from their existing email subscribers as to whether they would like to continue receiving future marketing emails or not. Marketers worry that there would be lots of unsubscribes and in the end, their email list would be so small that it is not even worth doing any more email marketing. Data profiling will be affected as well \u2014 although this marketing technique will still be allowed after May 25 2018 but consumers have the right to request to stop the profiling.\n\nLots of EU citizens welcome the GDPR but for businesses, it seems to be a bad news.\n\nHowever, is the GDPR really bad for businesses? Undeniably, there will be more restrictions and governance, but if you see this from another perspective, there is a sliver lining \u2014 the situation is not as gloomy as it seems.\n\nFor email marketing, businesses can take this opportunity to clean up their email list \u2014 people who unsubscribe probably did not and will not open or read your company emails, by trimming down the list, your email open rate will be improved. With a better email list, you can segment your subscribers and provide personalised email content to them. All these can enhance your customer engagement.\n\nApart from engagement, the GDPR can build customer trust and loyalty. How so? Your organization is investing time, money and human resources in safeguarding the customer data, your customers can see the effort and they will be more confident in continuing the business relationship with you.\n\nThe GDPR doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with customer experience but actually it does. By providing the choice to let your customer opt in or out to your email list, it is an obvious gesture that you respect your customer privacy and this is an important aspect of great customer experience.\n\nIn a post-GDPR world, marketing is not becoming more difficult. On the contrary, marketing will become more authentic and effective. Fellow marketers, embrace the change!"

        "text": "Building a Brand from Zero \u2014 Step 3: Conquer the world\n\nCreating a brand is tough, no question about it. Today\u2019s world is filled with early start-ups, crowd-funded brands and DBA\u2019s (stands for \u201cdoing business as\u201d and allows Joe Schmoe to act as a brand). Entrepreneurship is at an all-time high because we all feel entitled to be founders and CEO\u2019s; myself very much included. In this crowded market, it can be difficult to start a sustainable brand from literally nothing and build it into a global player without going broke during the process. But following the process lined out in this article will help you keep yourself organized and on track to build a brand ready to take over the world.\n\nIn the second episode of \u201cBuilding a Brand from Zero\u201d, we discussed various ways to build an audience, and effectively engage with potential customers and clients all around the globe. If you missed said episode, you should definitely check it out before reading on.\n\nThe final episode of this mini-series will focus on the steps you should take to ensure that your brand will be able to succeed on a global basis.\n\nRefer a friend: Current customers and clients are your greatest assets when it comes to growing your brand. Leverage the positive experience you have provided to your customer base to encourage the referral of your services or products. You could, for example, offer a special discount for new customers if they are referred by a current customer, or offer other incentives to drive referrals to your services and products. Stay in touch with past customers through E-Mail Newsletters or Social Media to foster a long-term relationship and to remind them of the incredible value your brand previously provided, and use this relationship to reach friends and family of past customers.\n\nGuest blogging: A great way to grow your brand with a limited audience is to leverage the audience of a different brand. For example, you could write guest blogs and posts for a variety of brands or news outlets in your specific niche. If your brand offers sporting apparel, find blogs that offer guidance to readers interested in outdoor activities and offer to write a blog post, free of charge of course. Use this opportunity to introduce yourself, and potentially your brand to this audience, and hopefully, your brand will start to gain recognition.\n\nCreate content: The quickest and \u201ceasiest\u201d way to grow your brand is by providing valuable content through your blog and Social Media platforms. Offering free content like infographics, videos, blog posts or even simple images allows you to foster a relationship with new and current clients, and builds trust in your brand. Providing free content also allows you to position yourself as an expert and authority figure on a specific topic, which in turn can be leveraged to obtain new customers and clients.\n\nI always like to say that entrepreneurs don\u2019t build brands with blood and sweat to simply stay small and local to one particular area. Brands are built to grow to a global level, it is the intention of every founder to achieve global success and recognition. That being said, going global takes time and plenty of effort, and cannot be achieved overnight.\n\nYou also have to keep in mind that your brand will face both language barriers and time differences, as well as a different political, social and economic landscape in different parts of our world. To expand your reach globally, keep the following in mind:\n\nFirm foundations are vital: Before you take your brand global, ensure that you have the basics in place and can build on a strong foundation. Resources and a solid team are necessary to balance your overseas venture while maintaining your current customer base.\n\nConsult global experts: Your goal and the main focus will be the expansion of your brand and juggling the small nuances that come with running your business day-to-day. You should, therefore, rely on the assistance of experts in your target market to ensure a smooth journey. Laws and Regulations can be quite different in countries across the globe, and it is vital to have the necessary inside knowledge to navigate potential pitfalls.\n\nPenetrating the market: Once you are ready to actually penetrate the market of your choice focus on the local Social Media platforms (these may be different from the platforms you use in your home-market, i.e. WeChat and Sina Weibo should be targeted in China) and marketing strategy to bring about a local brand presence. With the widespread use of technology and social media, you can reach global coverage without actually going through the bureaucratic hassle of incorporation in that country. Once you have gained a foothold in your target market, it is time to slowly expand your reach by providing value and gaining your first followers and future customers.\n\nThe last piece of advice I want to hand out is the following: Stay bold in your endeavor to build a brand from the ground up. Times can get tough, and you may feel like giving up. Don\u2019t. All the sweat, tears and long nights will be worth it once you succeed. Continue to stay bold and full of confidence on your journey, and nothing will be able to stop you."

        "text": "You have an idea of what your company is going to become. You plan and you strategise. But once you start, it\u2019s a whole different story.\n\nBefore we began our company, our goal was to help brands create content. We had identified it as an area that was sorely lacking in Hong Kong (and most of Asia, where brands are typically a few years behind). Brands had social media, but they lacked the resources or understanding to create content on a regular basis (far too many social media accounts were dormant). There was a real need, and we were looking to fill it. We weren\u2019t wrong, but that wasn\u2019t where the real demand was.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and we discovered that yes, brands needed help creating content, but there was an even bigger need! Brands in HK had no idea what they were even doing on the digital space. They all had websites and social media channels, but only because they thought they should be there \u2014 there was no thinking into why they should be there, what should be on them and how it was going to benefit the company. Before we could solve their content needs, we had to solve their strategy needs. Thus, we branched out to help brands figure out their digital strategy.\n\nA couple months later, a new need emerged. Companies that were starting to understand digital, were looking to make their first hires in the digital space. The problem though, was how are they supposed to tell the difference between a good digital person or a bad digital person? They didn\u2019t know the space personally, so they didn\u2019t know what questions to ask. Would the person be able to solve the company\u2019s problems? There was really no way of knowing \u2014 and it would all come down to dumb luck. But that wasn\u2019t it \u2014 once they hired the person, how were they going to figure out what the person was supposed to do?\n\nIn the past couple of months, a number of clients have approached with the same problem \u2014 how do we hire and what do we get them to do? As a result, we\u2019re looking to help address this problem. While the details aren\u2019t firm yet, we\u2019re looking to branch out into a bit of headhunting (not in the same way it\u2019s currently being done, but a hybrid approach) as well as consultation that involves us developing, nurturing and guiding the talent. Most likely this will evolve over time.\n\nInstead of branching out our digital agency in SEO/SEM, PPC, influencer marketing, and many other fields like 99% of the agencies out there \u2014 we\u2019re going in a direction that actually needs help. We\u2019re looking to create our own category and truly differentiate. It\u2019s a gamble for sure, but it\u2019s a risk we\u2019re willing to take (why fight among the crowds when you can outright standout?).\n\nIt\u2019s been a strange time. The point is that you don\u2019t really know where the demand really is until you start doing things. It doesn\u2019t matter how good your theories are, things in the real world rarely ever match up. It takes time and effort to see where the real opportunities are."

(Not that there\u2019s ever a \u201cgood time!\u201d)\n\nI broke a bone in my right hand, which is likely going to require surgery, and I may have torn my rotator cuff which could mean a separate surgery and track of rehab. And of course, I\u2019m right-handed.\n\nSo, since I use a computer for a living, what the heck am I going to do? Well, nothing has ever stopped me before, and this certainly isn\u2019t about to.\n\nI\u2019m typing and using the mouse with my left hand now. It\u2019s a bit slower going but I\u2019m getting better at it. I\u2019m also exploring \ud83c\udfa4 dictation and voice control software such as the built-in Dictation System within OS X. It\u2019s actually pretty good. I\u2019ve added a note in my email signature indicating that this email is being dictated, so apologies for any typos. I switched my iPhone keyboard to one-handed mode. I\u2019m also going to explore the Dragon line of voice control products. There\u2019s a guy who used Dragon NaturallySpeaking and some other add-ons to develop an entire video game using only his voice.

        "text": "The 5 Machine Learning Use Cases that Optimize Your Airbnb Travel Experience Wondering how Airbnb sorts and delivers its listings when you search for a place to stay on your next getaway? If you know anything about machine learning, you might have expected that there are a plethora of variables that go into sorting the tens of thousands of listings that are sometimes available in a specific location. Unlike machines, it\u2019s impossible for one human being to go through each listing \u2014 and if you\u2019re indecisive by nature, this could pose an existential problem. That\u2019s why Airbnb\u2019s machine learning algorithms do the work for you, pulling signals from a variety of data points, depending on whether you are host or guest. Optimizing matches between hosts and guests will be critical to Airbnb\u2019s success as it continues to grow. The variety in types of accommodations Airbnb has is an advantage, as long as it ensures guests can easily find a host that meets their criteria. And as Airbnb adds to its 4 million current listings, ensuring both guests and hosts are satisfied will become more crucial. If users can find the exact accommodation they are looking for, especially if it is at a cheaper price, they are unlikely to revert to using hotels. So how does Airbnb do such an amazing job of optimizing guest-host matching? After spending a couple of weeks digging up on Airbnb Technical Blog, I discover that there are 5 important use cases of machine learning that are currently being deployed by Airbnb\u2019s engineers and data scientists to solve this problem. Here they are, in respective order of presentation: The goal of this machine learning system is to discover what affects the hosts\u2019 decisions to accept accommodation requests and how Airbnb could increase acceptances and matches on the platform. After doing initial data query and experiments, Airbnb found out that the hosts were more likely to accept requests that fit well in their calendar and minimize gap days. Additionally, hosts in big markets (such as San Francisco or New York City) care a lot about their occupancy; while for small markets, hosts prefer to have a small number of nights between requests. Thus, if Airbnb could promote in their search results those hosts who would be more likely to accept an accommodation request resulting from a potential guest\u2019s search query, they would expect to see happier guests and hosts and more matches that turned into fun vacations or productive business trips. At first glance, this seems like a perfect case for collaborative filtering \u2014 we have users (hosts) and items (trips) and we want to understand the preference for those items by combining historical ratings (accept/decline) with statistical learning from similar hosts. However, the application does not fully fit in the collaborative filtering framework for two reasons. First, no two trips are ever identical because behind each accommodation request there is a different guest with a unique human interaction that influences the host\u2019s acceptance decision. Taking this point one step further, a host can receive multiple accommodation requests for the same trip with different guests at different points in time and give those requests conflicting votes. Thus, Airbnb engineers and data scientists built a model resembling collaborative filtering. They used the multiplicity of responses for the same trip to reduce the noise coming from the latent factors in the guest-host interaction. To do so, they considered hosts\u2019 average response to a certain trip characteristic in isolation. Instead of looking at the combination of trip length, size of guest party, size of calendar gap and so on, they looked at each of these trip characteristics by itself. For predictions, they combined the preferences for different trip characteristics into a single prediction for the probability of acceptance. The weight the preference of each trip characteristic has on the acceptance decision is the coefficient that comes out of the logistic regression. To improve the prediction, they also included a few more geographic and host specific features in the logistic regression. The flow chart summarizes the modeling technique used:\n\nThe goal of this machine learning system is to answer a very common question from Airbnb hosts: How do I pick the right price? Setting a price can be hard without reliable information about other listings in hosts\u2019 area, travel trends, and the interest people have in the amenities hosts offer. Thus, the team at Airbnb decided to build a model that can share insights that they learned with the hosts. An insight is a campaign that guides hosts to become more successful at pricing. Each insight must be personalized, targeted, and actionable. To serve up the insights, they created Narad \u2014 a backend service that ingests data from a set of offline and online data sources to generate personalized insights, rank their effectiveness for different listings and contexts, and deliver insights at the right place and right time.\n\nAn insight generated by Narad consists of the following: Identifiers: This includes the insight type that is the identifier of each insight, the placement that tells which host tool this insight can be delivered to, and other grouping information. Targeting: This is a list of targeting conditions that need to be satisfied in order for the insight to be eligible for a given listing. There are various dimensions such as occupancy, past and future bookings, market demand, geography, listing attributes and pricing settings over which insights can be targeted. Payload: This determines a set of personalized information that the insight displays to the host. Example payloads range from the suggested values for host settings to the benefit to the host such as the potential booking increase. Copy: This contains the information to fetch the internationalized content for the UI. Narad is responsible for delivering the most relevant and impactful insights to the host. The first iteration of ranking defines the total value of each insight through a set of terms. The first term is the weight which refers to the inherent impact of the insight. The second term is the historical conversion rate of the particular insight. Some insights might carry high impact but draw less attention from hosts. Other insights might get a lot of conversions but not be inherently impactful. The first term and the second term keep this balance. The last term is the repetition penalty that discounts the total value of the insight if the same insight was ranked as the top insight last time. This helps providing some variance on the top position so that the same insight doesn\u2019t appear at the top over and over even though it is the best insight in order to keep hosts more engaged. 3 \u2014 Predicting value of homes on Airbnb At Airbnb, predicting home values is a specific use case of Customer Lifetime Value modeling, which captures the projected value of a user for a fixed time horizon. At marketplace companies like Airbnb, knowing users\u2019 Lifetime Values enable them to allocate budget across different marketing channels more efficiently, calculate more precise bidding prices for online marketing based on keywords, and create better listing segments. For Lifetime Value modeling, Airbnb developed machine learning tools that abstract away the engineering work behind product-ionizing machine learning models. In specific, there are 4 tasks in their ML workflow for this task:\n\nAt the Feature Engineering phase, Airbnb used their internal feature repository Zipline, which provides features at different levels of granularity, such as the host, guest, listing, or market level. The crowdsourced nature of this internal tool allows their data scientists to use a wide variety of high quality, vetted features that others have prepared for past projects. If a desired feature is not available, a user can create his/her own feature with a feature configuration file. At the Prototyping and Training phase, Airbnb constructed data pipelines, available in Scikit-Learn and Spark, that allow their data scientists to specify high-level blueprints that describe how features should be transformed, and which models to train. At a high level, they used pipelines to specify data transformations for different types of features, depending on whether those features are of type binary, categorical, or numeric. The advantage of writing prototypes with pipelines is that it abstracts away tedious data transformations using data transforms. Collectively, these transforms ensure that data will be transformed consistently across training and scoring, which solves a common problem of data transformation inconsistency when translating a prototype into production. At the Model Selection phase, Airbnb utilized their AutoML frameworks to speed up the process. By exploring a wide variety of models, they found which types of models tended to perform best. For example, they learned that eXtreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) significantly outperformed benchmark models such as mean response models, ridge regression models, and single decision trees. Finally, for Taking Model Prototypes to Production, Airbnb built a framework called ML Automator that automagically translates a Jupyter notebook into an Airflow machine learning pipeline. This framework is designed specifically for data scientists who are already familiar with writing prototypes in Python, and want to take their model to production with limited experience in data engineering. Fighting financial fraud is one of the most important task at Airbnb to ensure the trust in their platform. The company has leveraged machine learning, experimentation, and analytics to identify and block fraudsters while minimizing impact on the overwhelming majority of its good users.\n\nLike all online businesses, Airbnb faces fraudsters who attempt to use stolen credit cards. When the true cardholder realizes their card has been stolen and notices unauthorized charges on their bill, the credit card company issues what\u2019s called a \u201cchargeback,\u201d and the merchant returns the money. Airbnb detects financial fraud in a number of ways, but their workhorse method uses machine-learning (ML) models trained on past examples of confirmed good and confirmed fraudulent behavior. To stop the use of stolen credit cards, their chargeback model triggers a number of frictions to ensure that the guest is in fact authorized to use that card, including micro-authorization (placing two small authorizations on the credit card, which the cardholder must identify by logging into their online banking statement), 3-D Secure (which allows credit card companies to directly authenticate cardholders via a password or SMS challenge), and billing-statement verification (requiring the cardholder to upload a copy of the billing statement associated with the card). Very recently, Airbnb has developed a Listing Embedding technique for the purpose of improving Similar Listing Recommendations and Real-Time Personalization in Search Ranking. The embeddings are vector representations of Airbnb homes learned from search sessions that allow them to measure similarities between listings. They effectively encode many listing features, such as location, price, listing type, architecture and listing style, all using only 32 float numbers.\n\nEmbeddings is a concept from Natural Language Processing used for word representations. Researchers from the Web Search, E-commerce and Marketplace domains have realized that just like one can train word embeddings by treating a sequence of words in a sentence as context, the same can be done for training embeddings of user actions by treating sequence of user actions as context. Examples include learning representations of items that were clicked or purchased or queries and ads that were clicked. These embeddings have subsequently been leveraged for a variety of recommendations on the Web. At Airbnb, they trained and optimized their models to learn listing embeddings for 4.5 million active listings on Airbnb using more than 800 million search clicks sessions, resulting in high quality listing representations. To evaluate what characteristics of listings were captured by the embeddings, they examined them in several ways. First, to evaluate if geographical similarity is encoded, they performed k-means clustering on learned embeddings. Next, they evaluated average cosine similarities between listings of different types (Entire Home, Private Room, Shared Room) and price ranges and confirmed that cosine similarities between listings of same type and price ranges are much higher compared to similarities between listings of different type and price ranges."

        "text": "The choices which are not really choices. Disregarded decisions. Doing things the way they\u2019ve always been done. Thinking what you\u2019ve always thought.\n\nDefault actions. Pressing snooze the second the alarm rings. Making coffee as soon as you arrive at the office. Going straight to your inbox after switching on your laptop. Pulling out your phone in a queue. Asking how are you?\n\nThere are figures floating around about how much of our day is taken up by habitual behaviours- around 40\u201350%. But I think it goes deeper than that. These defaults don\u2019t just manifest in obvious behaviours. They\u2019re also there in our thinking, our response to stress or crisis or failure.\n\nThe image Storr gives of a bankrupt business person leaping from a window, believing themselves to have no future and disregarding their past, is an extreme example. But it\u2019s so easy to slip into the mindset of always assuming the worst.\n\nWhat is catastrophic thinking? It goes like this:\n\nYou call your cat, she doesn\u2019t appear straight away and you assume you left a window open and she\u2019s fallen out. You panic, start running around the house calling her name, and then she emerges, yawning and rumpled, from under the bed and blinks at you.\n\nA friend is late for meeting you and doesn\u2019t answer your call so you start thinking she must have been hit by a car, starting imagining what it will be like to blame yourself for the rest of your life because it would never have happened if you hadn\u2019t arranged this. And then she shows up a few minutes later, she was just held up and didn\u2019t answer your call because -duh \u2014 there\u2019s no signal on the subway.\n\nA coworker doesn\u2019t answer an email and then you realise another coworker hasn\u2019t answered your email from yesterday either. You panic, you think you\u2019ve done something terrible, you\u2019ve fucked up, you\u2019ve been fired, you\u2019ve done something so awful that you\u2019re going to get blacklisted and never work again. Just as you start debating which organ to sell first, you hear from them both and it was just coincidence, they were both just busy.\n\nIt goes on and on. It becomes a default. Any tiny setback or mishap or mistake and it\u2019s the end of the world. Everything is a sign that you\u2019re going to die alone and broke with no friends. No matter how well things so, you\u2019re always anxious. You\u2019re always imagining death and destruction and misery.\n\nAren\u2019t we humans good at creating our own little private hells?"

        "text": "Now I\u2019ve been guilty in the past of starting many a personal project. Some I\u2019ve put my heart and soul into and others I\u2019ve kind of let fall by the way-side. Yes, many of us have been guilty of this process I\u2019m sure. When I started out on each of these projects I always had the very best intentions (or so I thought), and felt like I was bringing something valuable to the table with Project X, Y or Z. But as I came to realise, if your heart is not in it and the project at hand is not floating your entrepreneurial boat then you\u2019ll lose interest and Project X will unfortunately become neglected. And that\u2019s not cool for both parties. With my recent project, the one I\u2019m going to be filling you in on in this article, it\u2019s something which I\u2019ve always had more of a passion about, and it was something that I felt hadn\u2019t been done, well not exactly in the way I was hoping to present it. So I was bringing something fresh(er) to the table this time around.\n\nBefore I\u2019d mostly been re-hashing products that had come before, and felt that what I was creating or had created was not peaking on the originality scale in any shape or form, and that has always bugged me. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t take an existing product and put your own spin on it. MySpace > Facebook anyone? And achieve remarkable success with it, but I never felt that comfortable with doing that. With my latest product, which I attached the label of MentorOla to (It\u2019s a service for connecting Design Mentors & Mentees), I wanted to take things back to basics a little more. Think of it is an Anti-Twitter/Slack product, taking things back to a more personal level, one-one-one.\n\n#DesignTwitter for example, can be vicious place for a fledging designer in this industry. I\u2019ve seen it first-hand and it ain\u2019t always pretty! And Slack channels as valuable as they can be, can drown out your voice in a sea of, well, lots of other voices. Now, I cannot say that a certain book, by a certain author didn\u2019t set me on the path to my \u2018Creating a product in 7 Days\u2019 adventure, but the ball still was in my court to whether I took their advice and acted on it. Too many past projects have been stretched to unimaginable proportions of time spent. 3 months, 4 months and more\u2026 And for me to then realise maybe this wasn\u2019t such a great idea is a crazy waste of my time and energy, so barring one project that an outside developer is taking way to much time on finishing things up, all of my recent personal projects have been sticking to the 7 day suck-it-and-see method. Without risking sounding like a broken record, you will probably know that having the least amount of time on your side does spur you on to completion of a product. I know this from working on client projects and have a weekend to fix s**t by Monday morning or that aforementioned s**t will be hitting the fan!\n\nWhen time is not on your side you block everything else out and focus on the essentials for getting Product X out of the door. MVP, MLP whatever you want to call it can be tweaked, fine-tuned and the like after launch. Don\u2019t lose your shit over those smaller details that are holding you back from launch, and can more than wait till Version 1.0.1. That\u2019s not to say you should be looking at pushing out a broken product, oh no, no, no! You\u2019re going to piss off potential customers right from the off, make sure it does its job and works, but don\u2019t sweat the small details that don\u2019t need to go into that launch day product of yours. All of those tiny elements can come at a later date. Don\u2019t sweat it! No one is going to give the slightest f**k if the Titles on your homepage are 24pt instead of the 32pt your creative visionary mind is aching to display. Forget about \u2019em and leave that stuff at the door until the next update. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed the time restrictions imposed on me and getting past that initial worry or maybe the right term would be a misunderstanding of is it really possible to get a working product out of the door and into the hands of Joe/Jane Public within a week!\n\nIt has not been a worry for me be that on Day 1, 5 or 6 if I could achieve my goal. Granted I do have a knowledge of both Design and Code so those bases were kind of covered and did not have me relying on a 3rd Party to get certain aspects of my product completed. That in itself I\u2019m sure helped shave some time off, and gave me the confidence that I could knock this bad-boy out of the park! Even then, grabbing a WordPress theme, keeping it in its plain vanilla form and uploading that to the URL of your choice would not be that much of a challenge to the non-code loving person. There\u2019s umpteen tools out there to assist you nowadays when your skill set is lacking in a specific area. My advice to you, if you\u2019re thinking about launching that product that you\u2019ve talked about until the person sat across from you has now switched off to your ramblings, is just go ahead and launch that s**t!\n\nDon\u2019t just talk about it, don\u2019t just dream about it, just go ahead and get it done, live and kicking, then ask questions (user feedback to be exact) later. My new project is ticking along nicely. With quite minimal exposure, and in a short amount of time (around 3 or 4 weeks), the sign up for Paid Mentees is looking quite promising and the Churn seems to be on the low which is a positive. You will never know until you\u2019ve gone ahead and launched, and it pains me to think how many great ideas never came to fruition because of folks never getting that big idea of theirs into the hands of users all the while shouting \u201cI don\u2019t have the damn time!\u201d 7 Days to see if it will sink or float? Surely you have time for that right? Fire up the Coffee Machine, and your chosen device, and just give it a shot (make that a double-shot). If you\u2019d like to check out my new product; MentorOla you can gladly hop on over here. Thanks for reading the article,"

        "text": "5 Common But Huge Mistakes You Are Probably Making In Your Business\n\nSo you\u2019re a business owner, right? Besides running your own biz are you also in charge of the accounting, finances, social media, email marketing, content creation, advertising, etc\u2026?\n\nSounds like the life of a business owner! Being your own boss comes with freedom but it also comes with a lot of responsibility because everything begins and ends with you.\n\nYou are the #boss.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably worked for other companies before starting your own business and soon found out that it\u2019s just not the same.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s only up from here! Everything you take the time to learn now and implement in your business will bring value to you and those around you in the future. It all starts with taking action, building a foundation, and gaining experience.\n\nSo I wanted to take today to share some of the biggest mistakes I see business owners making and how you can avoid making these seemingly small but impactful mistakes.\n\nThe idea that blogging is just for bloggers and not business cant be farthest from the truth. As Gary Vaynerchuk says, your business is first and foremost a media company.\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? Well the way you build a brand and therefore a business is through putting out content that your audience finds value in. You\u2019re able to build both credibility and trust by doing this.\n\nBlogging is always a good way to go because of the SEO benefits but if you just hate writing then there is always podcasts and YouTube videos.\n\nThe mediums are there; it\u2019s now your choice of what you do with them.\n\nI hate to use this phrase since its been used way too many times, but \u201ccontent is king\u201d and the medium you use matters also. The medium that you use whether its blogging on your site, podcasts, or youtube is the vehicle to get your message out.\n\nIt\u2019s about how consistently you do it and what\u2019s within those blogs that matter. Putting out a 300-word post once every other week isn\u2019t doing you or your audience any favors.\n\nLike with everything, consistency is what makes the difference.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to put out a 1,000 word blog post every day (if you can then that\u2019s amazing!), but it does mean that you should commit to a posting schedule that is realistic to you.\n\nI put out posts every Tuesday\u2019s and Friday\u2019s(on my business webiste) because this is what is realistic to me and I know I can do this without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBesides posting your content on your site you can also repurpose this content on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, etc\u2026 Of course these are all different platforms and should be treated at such but you can still repurpose your blog content accordingly.\n\nBefore I go more in depth with this I just want to say I have not yet used FB ads for my business, since I am in the beginning stages but this is something I am planning on jumping on.\n\nI have run FB ads in the past for one of my clients and have seen it work for them, not to mention the countless podcasts and books that swear by FB ads.\n\nThink about it though, how much of your personal information is on FB? From what high school you went to your favorite TV shows, Facebook is built for effective targeting.\n\nFacebook\u2019s organic reach is not as good as it used to be so we now have to pay for what used to be free but it is what its is and its still \u201ccheap\u201d for what you get.\n\nIt\u2019s all about supply and demand, unless people suddenly drop off Facebook then using FB ads is going to continue to increase so might as well take advantage of it now.\n\nWhether you sell a physical product or a service, FB is a great platform for getting in front of your ideal audience. Of course you have to know what you are doing so I\u2019m not suggesting you start a FB ad campaign today and throw thousands of dollars at it, but I do want to get FB ads on your radar.\n\nTake the time to learn how to run effective ads or hire someone that knows how to do it. Before you start your campaign don\u2019t forget to figure out what\u2019s your goal with it.\n\nIs it getting more FB likes, building brand awareness, getting email subscribers, or selling products?\n\nKeep in mind that you are popping up on peoples news feed (or side bars) and it may be the first time they even hear about you so trying to sell something right off the bat might not be the best approach (although not impossible).\n\nYou want to target your ideal client and let them know how you can help them. This brings me to the next point, which is email marketing\u2026.\n\nEmail marketing has been around since the 1990\u2019s but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s become irrelevant it\u2019s simply evolved. Open rates have declined since the beginning of email marketing but it\u2019s still an effective way to communicate with your ideal clients and most importantly build a relationship with them.\n\nYup, you gotta build that relationship with them! Here\u2019s another cheesy but true phrase for you, \u201cPeople buy from people they like and trust\u201d.\n\nThis is where email marketing becomes your best friend ! Like I said in my previous post.\n\nThere is so much more that goes into email marketing but I just want you to get you in a mindset of embracing how important it is for your business.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not saying this just because I offer website design in my business.\n\nTrust me, I get it. Starting a business is hard and you\u2019re spending your own hard earned money on launching it. Most people start their business as a side thing while working a 9\u20135 to pay their bills so it\u2019s a tricky position to be in.\n\nIf you can afford to invest in a designer then do it but if you cant then you cant and have to work with what you\u2019ve got ( I developed \u201cThe Ultimate Guide To Website Success\u201d to help you do just that).\n\nBut once you are in a position where you\u2019re more established and can afford it then find a designer that understands your goals + your audience and can deliver a website that is not only beautiful but one that converts.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially like an employee that you pay once (to create it) and then it just keeps working for you for years to come.\n\nOf course you will have to make changes to it as you grow but it should be created in a way that it communicates your brand story while taking your audience to the pages you want them to land on.\n\nPinterest is known as the recipe and home d\u00e9cor heaven for most but its sooo much more than that.It\u2019s a platform that is not as intuitive as FB and Instagram but it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nThink of it as a visual Google with keywords and all. Unlike FB and Instagram, your posts live for more than a couple of hours and the pinning aspects of the platform allow you to be found by so many people.\n\nIt\u2019s not about how many followers you have but about the value in the content you post and how many re-pins it gets.\n\nYou can post images that send users straight to your website where they can read your full blog post or opt in for that freebie you promised. You can even post images that send users to your YouTube videos if that\u2019s more of your thing!\n\nI\u2019ve seen stories of people getting hundreds of visits to their website just through Pinterest alone. To me that sounds crazy!\n\nYou are not paying for any type of ads. Of course you need to learn how to use the right keyword and pin descriptions though.\n\nSounds like a lot of work? Well thanks to software like Boardbooster and Tailwind you can pretty much automate most of the process."

        "title": "SportsCastr: Beta IV Release! \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "There\u2019s an old adage in the development community that goes If you\u2019re not embarrassed by your initial release then you\u2019re doing it wrong. While it would be a fallacy to say that we were at all embarrassed by the version of SportsCastr that existed nine months ago, had that Alpha included any features beyond the bare minimum \u2014 an out-and-out MVP \u2014 we would have handcuffed our own creativity. Of the many projects we, as individuals or other permutations of the current SportsCastr dev team, have built in the past, some entered the world as near tabulae rasae while others were introduced in evolved states. The latter sort never (really, never) came to fruition.\n\nA human being is born with an extraordinary neural deficit. It takes some twenty years or more to develop the billions of neural pathways that define one as mature. A bee, though, is more or less born mature. Since its programming is orders of magnitude more simplex than that of a human being, it can leave the egg/larval state without the necessity to build complex systems. Meanwhile, a human being, by being born vulnerable and dumb, requires time and care in order to fully develop; and this very process of development \u2014 from dumb to smart, from vulnerable to self-sustaining \u2014 renders man more intelligent than a bee.\n\nSo it goes with applications.\n\nResources take many forms: time, money, energy, creativity, focus, people. Allocating resources improperly, or even simply in the wrong order, can upset the entire development process. Imagine a baby that can run extremely fast on strong grown-up legs. How often is this baby running stupidly into traffic or into a predator\u2019s jaws? Now imagine a digital platform that includes a complex feature like predictive search before it has sufficient inputs from its user-base about what the users are actually searching for. Now imagine that you need to pitch an investor group for a Series A, using the funds to develop your core functionality. No one is investing and you\u2019ve wasted a great deal of your early-stage resources. Time. Money. Energy.\n\nWhen we conceived of SportsCastr we recognized that it would be critical to build from the ground up. This approach would provide the proper creative space for, among many other possibilities, us to present a vision of an exciting future, and for any collaborator (user, advisor, investor, journalist, etc.) to dream up potential uses. One of our senior advisors likes to tell a story about his experience in the oil business decades ago. Nobody wanted to invest in wells. Wells were stable, predictable investments. Instead, people wanted to invest in exploration. The moral of the story is that fantasies of the future are more attractive than existing operations. Overlaying this model atop the development cycle of an application, a good user experience has a launch point and a direction, but not an end. To produce something \u201cfully baked\u201d from day one negates the potential for the platform to mature based on its community activity. It restricts an investor\u2019s potential to be excited about the platform future. And it hamstrings the development team by, in essence, packaging the product before getting to know the customer."

        "text": "As my company has started to pull down the pre-launch curtains, we have found ourselves confronted with a predicament that I never expected. People in Silicon Valley want to give you their money, and for a large percentage of them, I don\u2019t want to take it.\n\nI\u2019m twenty-three years old, I\u2019m white, I\u2019m from a small town in New England, and I\u2019m fortunate enough to be fairly well-educated. Right now, our team is 70% white and 17% female. It doesn\u2019t take much to recognize that these numbers don\u2019t reflect the demographic United States, let alone planet Earth.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read anything from me before, you\u2019ll know that I think companies operate a lot like countries. My goal isn\u2019t to be a middling startup company, but to be like the UK, Singapore, Germany, the USA. Unsurprisingly, all of these have more or less an even 50\u201350 gender breakdown. To shed the metaphor, I want us to lead, to be a body of creatives, and to cultivate the most important of all things:\n\nIn my view, there is only one way to create Organic Diversity of Mind:\n\nPlant the seeds when growth is most rapid.\n\nHerein lies the problem with some, but not all Venture Capital funds. It\u2019s not that they reject Diversity of Mind, but that they ignore it. To ignore this integral variable is to limit the potential of organizational success \u2014 and that\u2019s something I am not willing to compromise.\n\nIt might be beneficial here to think of Affirmative Action as \u201cArtificial Diversity of Mind,\u201d created in the later stage. Unfortunately, this has proven to be a far more difficult and complex endeavor. So, given the gift of hindsight, I want to build a company that doesn\u2019t make this same mistake. Sure, it will make my life a bit tougher today, but if we start valuing thought diversity from the first dollar in, life will be a hell-of-a-lot better at the millionth."

        "title": "13 Principles to build successful and vibrant communities",
        "text": "Lessons learnt from leading one of the most successful open source software projects\n\nMy colleague Kohsuke Kawaguchi, has built Jenkins, one of the most popular open source projects in the market. He has built a vibrant and thriving community (by conservative estimates, 2M+ people use Jenkins) that continues to grow 14+ years after it\u2019s inception. I can confidently bet that Jenkins is behind at least a few applications that you are using in your daily lives.\n\nI have worked closely with Kohsuke Kawaguchi for the last 12 years, 10 of them sharing an office space where we have had long conversations about elegantly built software projects, thriving communities, monetisable business models and building successful startups (cloudbees.com).\n\nThrough all of this, I have been his partner growing the Jenkins community.\n\nAmongst others, I was the primary instigator who with a gang of 4 people started Jenkins World, a DevOps conference in 2011. Last week, Jenkins World was listed as the top #8 DevOps conference for 2018 (source: techgenix).\n\nI have had a co-driver seat in helping build this community and have had tremendous joy in discovering these principles and enthused about sharing them.\n\nThese lessons are applicable to a wide spectrum of communities from personal brands, engineering projects and marketing departments. You can take these principles and apply to build small tribes or huge communities.\n\nThe product or service is the bottom of the pyramid around which tribes are built. To get to the product, you have to show up and build something \u2014 day in and out.\n\nAfter years of coding, I had lost my verve in building things. Watching Kohsuke excitedly walk in on every Monday morning with a new project he built over the weekend was inspiring.\n\nI realised that building things isn\u2019t hard work if you take joy in making. Move away from angling for success in every endeavour.\n\nThe enlightening part for me was that I truly understood one of the principles laid out in Bhagwad Gita by Krishna, which goes as \u2014\n\nThe motto thus becomes\n\nFinally, you build a lot of things because you don\u2019t quite know what things will grip your community and take them by storm. The only way to discover it is to just do it.\n\nEven the best get jaded, if they are doing the same thing repeatedly.\n\nPick a hobby that fulfils you and make that as your outlet away from work. I had given up art because I am a workaholic and this lesson was a life-saver. Picking a hobby was a fantastic outlet for me (my pictures, my art).\n\nInterestingly enough, I easily experienced flow as I was making things during my hobby hours. Being in the flow state, left me fulfilled and energised for work. My idea levels, energy levels hit through the roof when I showed up at work the next morning. You can go build a community (or not) around your hobby too but remember it should not replace the joy of making.\n\nWhen you show your work, people get inspired and their inner maker longs to shed the cocoon of passive consumption and the vacuum that follows along.\n\nThe wings of inspiration give flight to humans and people are looking to get inspired.\n\nIt took me a while to go, I am going to build my own interesting body of work and show it to the world but it does happen.\n\nAusten Kleon in his short and lovely book \u201cShow your work\u201d makes a case that people want to see work in progress and not just the finished product, so shed any nervousness of showing incomplete work.\n\nIn the source software community, it is easy if you make your software open source and push it out for the world to see. Once people see the cool work, they want to know more, hear more and voila \u2014 you have the beginnings of a tribe.\n\nOnce you have got people intrigued, they will take a few nervous steps towards you \u2014 welcome them with open arms. My involvement in the Jenkins community started because I liked it and nervously walked across the office hallway to ask a really naive question. Not only did I get an answer, I was encouraged to contribute back and when I did contribute back, I was celebrated \u2014 they had me as a community member right there. Ten years and I am still a part of the community.\n\nYour tribe is a Venn diagram of contributors and users and each constituent is on the ride with you because you satisfy their particular needs. Thus, never forget that each circle in the Venn diagram exists to serve its constituents. You serve your contributors and tribe; your contributors serve your tribe; the tribe serves your need to provide something tangible and of value back to humanity.\n\nServing starts by listening to these sub-tribes and building what they ask for. A tribe will die on the vine if this cardinal rule is repeatedly flouted.\n\nIf there was a candidate for the word to show up most often in our conversations, it was credibility. Building a community stands on the bedrock of trust and credibility. Your tribe should see you not only do the talk but match it up with the walk too.\n\nLife isn\u2019t perfect and one messes up occasionally but if the tribe perceives you as authentic to your core ideals and promises, they will stick with you through the bad times.\n\nYears ago, a key client pounded on the table asking us to paint a 5 year vision for Jenkins. We didn\u2019t quite lay it out that way.\n\nThe key philosophy is that it is better to actually do the work than paint a rosy picture that might be unrealistic to adhere to. If you do look at the rate of innovation in the world, it is extremely hard to predict what\u2019s will happen 1\u20132 years from now let alone 5 years.\n\nSo show up and do the work and show the work, there are enough people who are promising the moon \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t be in that tribe.\n\nBuild a community that comes to you to scratch their itch and over time empower them to scratch their own itch. As a community leader, you want your community members to have a symbiotic relationship with each other. This can only be done if the community members can help themselves and the others.\n\nMark of a great leader is to build institutions and processes that outlast the leader. Once a community is up and thriving, the community leader should step in only when required and only in areas necessary.\n\nThe tribe will not scale if you are always in the middle of relationships. Set them free to chart their own paths and build their own relationships.\n\nPeople join communities if they know that they are valued, respected and believe that they will be treated fairly if things go south.\n\nEstablishing ground rules in a community to treat other humans fairly and with respect is an endeavour that has to be lived day to day as well.\n\nDo you want to follow someone who is a pompous ass?\n\nA community or leader can attract others only if they have an attitude of humility. If your core contributing team is ego-driven, you will have consumers following you and these members will never be in your tribe.\n\nThe difference between consumers and a community is that the consumers will flee to the next shiny product when it becomes good enough whereas the community will stick with you to build a shinier product.\n\nSide note: A year ago, I saw a keynote speaker show a picture of a dying man on screen and said that this person died on his watch in the ambulance that the keynote speaker manned. More importantly (as he took a breath full of himself) was how seeing a human die was a life changing experience for the speaker.This, while the rest of us watched in shock at the narcissism of this speaker.\n\nHow many followers do you think he garnered for his company that evening?\n\nShow up day in and day out.\n\nShow up day in and day out.\n\nShow up day in and day out.\n\nShow up day in and day out.\n\nShow up day in and day out.\n\nI cannot stress this enough.\n\nI live in Silicon Valley and see too many people who strongly believe that \u201cthey\u201d had everything to do with the success that they are enjoying at the moment.\n\nLuck is a huge factor in bringing success to your doorstep. Keeping this aspect in mind will bring the requisite humility to help facilitate other principles that I talked about earlier.\n\nWhen I grew up in India, our maids would bring in their kids to help them in their chores. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see how incredibly lucky I was as compared to these smart kids.\n\nKeep this in mind \u2014 always!\n\nIn summary, the keys to building a successful tribe or a community rest on the principles that your mother taught you \u2014 work hard, help and respect others, treat people fairly and count your blessings. It is painful to see that not too many people do it \u2014 so go ahead, employ them and a see a community build around your work."

        "text": "The ordering service takes the endorsed transactions and RW sets, orders this information into a block, and delivers the block to all committing peers.\n\nThe ordering service, which is made up of a cluster of orderers, does not process transactions, smart contracts, or maintains the shared ledger. The ordering service accepts the endorsed transactions and specifies the order in which those transactions will be committed to the ledger. The Fabric v1.0 architecture has been designed such that the specific implementation of \u2018ordering\u2019 (Solo, Kafka, BFT) becomes a pluggable component. The default ordering service for Hyperledger Fabric is Kafka.\n\nIn a blockchain network, transactions have to be written to the shared ledger in a consistent order. The order of transactions has to be established to ensure that the updates to the world state are valid when they are committed to the network. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, where ordering occurs through the solving of a cryptographic puzzle, or mining, Hyperledger Fabric allows the organizations running the network to choose the ordering mechanism that best suits that network. This modularity and flexibility makes Hyperledger Fabric incredibly advantageous for enterprise applications.\n\nHyperledger Fabric provides three ordering mechanisms: SOLO, Kafka, and Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT)\n\nThe committing peer validates the transaction by checking to make sure that the RW sets still match the current world state. Specifically, that the Read data that existed when the endorsers simulated the transaction is identical to the current world state. When the committing peer validates the transaction, the transaction is written to the ledger, and the world state is updated with the Write data from the RW Set.\n\nIf the transaction fails, that is, if the committing peer finds that the RW set does not match the current world state, the transaction ordered into a block will still be included in that block, but it will be marked as invalid, and the world state will not be updated.\n\nCommitting peers are responsible for adding blocks of transactions to the shared ledger and updating the world state. They may hold smart contracts, but it is not a requirement.\n\nLastly, the committing peers asynchronously notify the client application of the success or failure of the transaction. Applications will be notified by each committing peer.\n\nIn addition to the multitude of endorsement, validity, and versioning checks that take place, there are also ongoing identity verifications happening during each step of the transaction flow.\n\nAccess control lists are implemented on the hierarchical layers of the network (from the ordering service down to channels), and payloads are repeatedly signed, verified, and authenticated as a transaction proposal passes through the different architectural components."

        "text": "Asking these questions helps me find useful insight. Solving new problems helps me generate ideas for the initial problem. This is how I developed Human Media .\n\nAnd try to approach it from a more distant perspective. Expressing the problem out loud helps me identify it and call it by its name. Giving it other forms often leads me to different ideas to solve the problem. What I do to rethink my issues is to identify adversity from different angles:\n\nYes, and rethink my perception from different points of view. No matter what situation you have to face, I will most likely be stuck in a set of predefined assumptions. Challenging these fundamental assumptions allows me to extend my conception and awareness of the possibilities that I have not considered until now. I always start by asking \u201chow\u201d and then \u201cwhy\u201d and then I go deeper asking \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d again to each of the answers. Using this technique I always find new and better ways.\n\nOver the years I have worked on training the mind to overcome adversities and to improve it every day. I have designed a high-performance system composed of four critical factors. Here I share my experience and results:\n\nAnd take my thoughts and actions to the extreme. For me, this is the key to teaching the mind: investing in common conventions or considering radical alternatives. If it seems like I can\u2019t discover something new, then I try to reverse things. That is, instead of focusing on the problem or context, boosting sales or improving my service or product, my usual practice is to consider how I could create that same problem, decrease sales or damage my product or service. It\u2019s incredible how many resources and ideas I get from reverting ideas, helping to train the mind to leave the safety zone. When I get to them, I turn them over again as feasible solutions for the original situation.\n\nThis is how the Ultraproductivity method was born.\n\nYes, and discover new possibilities that shape my idea. According to the psychologist Howard Gardner, we all have multiple intelligences and not general intelligence. However, when faced with complex challenges, we tend to express ourselves, uniquely, through our ability to verbal reasoning. We lose so much there.\n\nEvery time I face something \u201cimpossible,\u201d I try to use different ways to communicate my thoughts. From talking to myself out loud, writing about the matter, sharing it with my five counselors, asking about it on Twitter and seeing what answers I get. I also put together a video of my concern and transmit it via podcast. I try to be creative, the experiment of doing a new thing a day for 520 days benefited me a lot. There are many ways to do it. For example, I also use colored pencils, putty, lego blocks, music, the association of words or painting, even sex.\n\nMost importantly, I do not try to solve (or create something) problems in this phase of expression. Just express it and have fun to discover new results. I know that my brain continues to work unconsciously on the initial problem (or creation or idea). It does this by trying to process information in different ways. By doing so, it triggers new thought patterns, which will generate more creative and disruptive results.\n\nThrough this system, I came to the idea of creating Stand OUT Program.\n\nTraining the mind is a matter of the following: training, testing, error, testing, error. Consistency, insistence, self-discipline, and self-awareness.\n\nNote: when I speak of ideas or problems, they can be extrapolated to projects, businesses, products, experiments, super habits, systems, productivity, and lifestyle."

        "text": "For centuries, people (including doctors) didn\u2019t believe in germs. In fact, some \u201cgentlemen\u201d were offended at the idea that their hands could be unclean. It wasn\u2019t until 1847 that soap-related hygiene started to gain recognition and even then it took many more years for the idea to be accepted.\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, observed that babies born in the streets were surviving more than those born in the clinic. Dr. Semmelweis noted,\n\nFrom this observation, Dr. Semmelweis realized that the doctors and medical students in the clinic would come from the autopsy room to the patient\u2019s room to deliver babies. He figured some unknown \u201ccadaverous material\u201d was infecting the babies. He ordered the doctors and medical students to wash their hands before examining patients and by doing so reduced the mortality rate from \u201cabout 10 percent (range 5\u201330 percent) to about 1\u20132 percent.\u201d Despite his large success, the medical community in Vienna viciously harassed Semmelweis for his stupid idea that soap could save lives.\n\nThe stupid ideas you have may be lifesaving\u2026even if it just saves one. That one, may just be you!\n\nDr. Semmelweis was brave. He was a doctor and his patients were dying \u2014 a tragedy that he said, \u201cmade me so miserable that life seemed worthless\u201d and still had the courage to be himself and do something about it. Even in the face of scorning, ridiculing and belittling by his peers, he chose the right path. He could have easily told himself not to believe or act on the crazy idea that an invisible force without a name at the time (germs) could be spreading disease and that washing hands was the remedy.\n\nDespite his feelings of misery (diminishment), he turned his hardship into playing hardball (increased capacity). Compelling thoughts and questions must have pressed on his mind that instead of ignoring, he tested, tried and proved.\n\nDo you have thoughts (stupid ideas) or questions that continually weigh on your mind that if you did something about them could improve your world?\n\nSome people think that because they\u2019ve suffered a tragedy or a hardship that they are somehow less and not able to move on. Dr. Semmelwies could have thought that he was a failure and stopped treating patients, but he chose to increase his efforts and try new methods to get desired results.\n\nAnd you are more now because of it.\n\nMy wife and I could have curled up into a ball and lived the rest of our lives as victims because our brother and then our baby passed away. But that would not have honored the life they lived, it would have made us miserable and suffocated our potential.\n\nThose ideas could change your life and the lives of others for good. Don\u2019t worry about the how of making those compelling ideas reality when they first come. Allow yourself to entertain the idea for a while and see it through in your mind. The how will come in time as you take steps to start making the idea become your new reality.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know how to talk before you talked or walk before you walked, did you? Nor did you know how to swim before you swam. Why would changing the world be any different?\n\nStarting something doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an entrepreneur. It\u2019s about making the improvements in life that you see need to be made. In fact, in today\u2019s ever-changing global economy, when employees have the guts to get stupid enough to start stuff within their company the company employees are refreshed, excited to come to work, trust increases and the bottom line flourishes.\n\nStupid creates meaning. Stupid generates money. Stupid is the new economy. Be the \u201cstupid one.\u201d\n\nNew Smart ideas and individuals have literally changed the world. Consider this quick handful of examples:\n\nThe telephone. Western Union originally rejected the telephone, saying in an internal memo in 1876, \u201cThe device is inherently of no value to us.\u201d\n\nThe automobile. In 1903, the president of Michigan Savings Bank advised Henry Ford\u2019s lawyer not to invest in the Ford Motor Company. \u201cThe horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty, a fad.\u201d\n\nThe radio. In response to David\u2019s Sarnoff\u2019s urgings for investment in the radio in the 1920s, his associates said, \u201cThe wireless music box has no imaginable com- mercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?\u201d\n\nMan on the Moon. In 1957, Lee De Forest, the man who pioneered radio and invented the vacuum tube, said, \u201cA man-made moon voyage will never occur regard- less of all future scientific advances.\u201d\n\nSatellites. In 1961, T. Craven, the FCC commis- sioner said, \u201cThere is practically no chance communica- tions space satellites will be used to provide better tele- phone, telegraph, television, or radio service inside the United States.\u201d\n\nThomas Edison. Said Edison himself, \u201cI don\u2019t know now what it was, but I was always at the foot of the class. I used to feel that the teachers never sympa- thized with me and that my father thought that I was stupid, and at last I almost decided that I must really be a dunce. . . . One day I overheard the teacher tell the inspector that I was \u2018addled\u2019 and it would not be worth- while keeping me in school any longer.\u201d\n\nWalt Disney. Walt Disney was fired by a newspaper editor because \u201che lacked imagination and had no good ideas.\u201d\n\nElvis Presley. Elvis, the king of rock and roll, was fired from the Grand Ole Opry after only one perfor- mance. \u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere, son. You ought to go back to drivin\u2019 a truck.\u201d\n\nThe list could go on for days.\n\nThese innovations and individuals spurred huge changes in the economy, the way we live, and the way we view the world. The New Smart has served as a catalyst that opened entirely new industries, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. People who lean into the New Smart courageously put on the metaphorical dunce cap and change the world.\n\nWhen you look at life through the stupid filter, you quickly find that quite often the stuff that sticks is the selfsame stuff that someone, somewhere, once wrote off as \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nIf some of the world\u2019s greatest success stories weren\u2019t willing to stop at stupid, neither should you."

You report back, too!\n\nI\u2019m ashamed to say that I\u2019m not already doing this.\n\nIf someone takes the time and effort to respond to one of my posts, I want to take the time and effort to acknowledge them and, hopefully, get a conversation going.\n\nThe connection and conversation is really why I\u2019m here, after all. It\u2019s my most meaningful income \u2014 you know, after my babies are fed, etc. So, my personal challenge for the month of May is to respond to every response left for me on a Medium post.\n\nAgain, if someone takes the time and effort to engage with me and my writing, I want to be on their team. It\u2019s super easy to follow someone when you\u2019re reading their comment. There\u2019s a little green follow button right there.\n\nThis is my favorite following story of all time:\n\nWhen my daughter Adrienne was in high school, she loved Meg Cabot. She followed Ms. Cabot on Twitter \u2014 and Ms. Cabot followed her back! My girl was so excited. Just so excited for a long time. It made an impression on me, as an author, and I make it a habit to follow back young readers who follow me on Twitter.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I haven\u2019t been following people who reach out to me on Medium. I\u2019m going to from now on. And hopefully? They\u2019ll follow me, too. And we\u2019ll get to be life long friends. (That\u2019s not creepy or anything, right?)\n\nThe thing that Michael wrote that stuck with me the most was this: If someone has 89 claps \u2014 get them to 100. Man, I love the idea of giving another writer a boost.\n\nIt feels so good to be able to see proof that what you write is affecting someone. It\u2019s also one reliable way that a reader can offer support to writers whose work they enjoy. When Medium can see that readers are engaging with a post, they show that post to more readers.\n\nClapping matters, and I don\u2019t do it enough. I just read and move on. Not okay!\n\nI noticed that Michael\u2019s post was at 451 claps and I pushed him all the way up to 500! That felt amazing. Did you know you can clap 50 times for a post? In the month of May, I\u2019m going to be an unrestrained clapper! Claps for everyone.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t stand there silent after a concert or a play \u2014 this month, I\u2019m not going to walk away from a Medium post I enjoyed without applauding."

        "title": "6 Top Ways to Get Free Publicity for your Small Business",
        "text": "Going public is something that every entrepreneur wants when it comes to the marketing part of both themselves and their company. And the main reason behind this is due to the enormous profits that can be harvested. The benefits here include the ones like the conversion of the potential clients into regular clients or even to make them loyal clients.\n\nAnd being the owner of a company, you definitely need the publicity of your company for allowing the public to learn all about your products or services that you have to offer them. It is laudable to record that no company can endure for long without publicity.\n\nAnd the reason is simple; if you do not share about your company with the public, then you would not have the chance of letting the general public learn all about your business and what you have to offer to them. Moreover, this is the reason why there are a lot of companies that are paying millions of dollars for advertising every year.\n\nMoreover, if you have an excuse or lack of money for advertising for your small business, you need to stop there. A lot of methods are out there through which you can easily get the publicity of your business with just a little money. As a matter of fact, a lot of the small business owners have taken up these methods and have a smiling bank account today.\n\nHence, if you are not sure about what these strategies are, then you can take help from the 6 tips shared below for obtaining a low cost or free publicity of your business:\n\nOne of the very first ways to get your business online and in the eyes of the public is by developing a website for your business. This would help you share all your information along with the products and the services that you have to offer.\n\nMoreover, you can create a sub-blog by adding valuable content that would let the public learn more about your products and services. And if you concentrate on SEO of the website, you would be able to get a good amount of traffic.\n\nThis is the best way in which you can gain publicity, but you would need to spend money for this. In short, you can just set up a referral system where a person can earn an amount of money when they refer your business or products to others.\n\nEventually, this would lead to a good amount of sales for your business. In short, you would have people marketing about your product as an affiliate, and they would be earning money just as you make both sales and cash through them.\n\nNot only this, seeing the others earn by promoting your business, many other people would join in to become affiliates and help gain sales for your business.\n\nVideo marketing is another method that can help you to market your business via videos easily on platforms like YouTube. If you decide to use YouTube to make your video about your business, you are making the right choice. This is since YouTube is the third most visited site in the world and has about 50 million visitors that come here each day.\n\nAnd if you are worried about the types of videos that you can make for your business, do not worry. You can easily make the \u2018how to\u2019 videos or even give proper information on each product or services that your company is selling, in the video. Moreover, you can also select from the many other video websites to share your video and obtain publicity.\n\nAn authority website is a site where people usually begin to trust and regularly visit for a specific niche or topic. The website gets it popularity over time, with hard work and even by spending money on it. And by posting guest posts on such websites that are related to your niche, you would be able to make your site popular and get traffic on it.\n\nFor this, you would need to contact the owner and let them know about your plan for the guest posting. After that, the owner can permit you to write on whatever you feel like or on a specific topic. And in the area for the information of the writer\u2019s profile, you can give details about your services, your website and even about yourself.\n\nAlso, the Authority sites should be from the same niche and offer the same services that you offer. This would let you get a good amount of visitors to your website.\n\nWith the help of the social networks, you would be able to get free publicity of your business. For example; there are about 800 million visitors on Facebook alone, and this can help you get new members on your website.\n\nAll you need to do is spread the word by making a page, searching for groups and joining them. You can also create a group and invite people to connect easily. Keep updating bits on your website so that people will stick around. If you do not like Facebook, there are other places like Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram.\n\nIn this method, it is obvious that you might need to give away free things to develop your fan group. You can do this on your social media page or even on your website. The free stuff can be anything from a product you are selling to ebooks, podcast, Webinar, etc., in exchange for emails or likes.\n\nAnd with the help of the emails, you would be able to notify those people about new services or products. You can also extend this to develop relationships by sending emails to them.\n\nAnd with the help of these ideas, you would be able to get publicity without spending millions of dollars for it. And this advice is to try almost every one of them, as they would cost you little to nothing and you would enjoy a good amount of traffic while you grow your brand."

        "title": "How to Set-up an Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence in Your Organization?",
        "text": "You need to bring in research orientated tech expertise and establish a platform that can catalyze the growth of the deep technology ecosystem and present the stimulus for innovation in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.\n\nThis new team should function like an extended team to the external units to deliver excellence by scaling up existing/new product/project activities build around artificial intelligence technology.\n\nFrom value creation to value realization, this new AI COE should deliver minimum viable product (MVP) with original ideas by experimenting with emerging technologies. A key step towards preparing COE for its success in the organization is to build prototypes with a long-term view and enhance ecosystems and partnerships to promote purposeful artificial intelligence\n\nThe people, process and technology must be in alignment for any new venture to be competent and holistic. These three components are the key steps towards a successful organizational transformation\n\nExecutive sponsorship: Senior management people play a significant role in the organization and an effective sponsorship from them is required so that you can improve collaboration across the organization. This will benefit you stay aligned on the strategic priorities. Once you secure their commitment sponsors can function as a point of escalation \u2014 but make clear you don\u2019t engage them for day-to-day tactical issues\n\nFinding the right team: This could be your biggest trouble. Getting people on-boarded for the right skills could make or break your center of excellence strategic plan. How do you source these people? Internal hire or external, local to your COE region or a mobile/remote worker from some another country\u2019s office\n\nCapture benchmark that can demonstrate value: If you can\u2019t measure it you can\u2019t manage it. Your leadership want to see measured progress and you need to have a dashboard to represent internal performance. Make it transparent and comprehensive.\n\nFinding the right problem: Be it your organization internal problem or customer use case, you need to research multiple launches. You need a design thinking before you act on building an AI platform. Talk to sales, interview clients, know their business pain points that can be solved by the adoption of artificial intelligence. Problem need to be thoroughly investigated so that you can apply the right AI tool to iron out, and present COE value proposition even for the early pilot launch.\n\nLeveraging the data to solve it: The importance of data availability and data quality are of pivotal value. Artificial Intelligence provides a whole different meaning to the importance of data. The collection, distribution, and validation of data are thus important issues in the formulation of solutions involving AI\n\nBuild a repeatable AI solution: A repeatable solution that can be offered to others in the company or marketed to the customer, drives value to the business. A template approach that can be applied to the different situations is invariably favorable. Center of excellence leaders need to hook up with numerous product owners, designers, business analysts in building horizontal or industry specific offering solutions"

        "title": "1000 True Fans Is Enough to Make a Living as a Creative",
        "text": "What Does It Take to Create 1000 True Fans?\n\nWhen I reported the analysis of my Medium stats, some of my readers suggested to analyze the number of claps as well. I didn\u2019t follow that advice back then. Unlike views, reads, and fans, claps cannot be downloaded.\n\nI received a comment a few days ago, that made me reconsider analyzing claps. My reader wrote that one of her posts received a low fans to reads ratio, but a high claps to fans ratio.\n\nShe asked me whether she should cultivate a small audience that liked her style or go for a wider popularity. My gut reaction to that question was to stick to that small audience.\n\nBefore explaining my point, let me mention that I\u2019m writing from my intuition. I didn\u2019t make a comprehensive statistical analysis on this.\n\nThe Goal of Copywriters, Bloggers, and Marketers\n\nCopywriters, bloggers, and marketers try to get their readers to take certain actions. In my case this is to follow me on Medium and to sign up to my email newsletter.\n\nThe number of people on each level is lower than the number of people on a higher level. That\u2019s why we call this sequence a funnel.\n\nThe More People at the Top, the More People at the Bottom?\n\nWe might expect that the more people there are at the top of the funnel, the more people would be at the bottom of the funnel. This might not be the case.\n\nA blogger could be wildly popular on the level of post views, but they might have a difficult time getting their books sold.\n\nAnother blogger might have modest post views, but they could be successful at converting those views to premium program purchases.\n\nWho would you rather be? The popular blogger with modest book sales? Or a modest blogger with high premium program sales? Honestly, I\u2019d like to be the second blogger.\n\nHow to Have Higher Conversion Rates\n\nIn order to be the second blogger, we might need to sacrifice popularity. Instead of trying to appeal to a broad public, we need to be ourselves and double down on what makes us unique. If that is an odd sense of humor, we need to cultivate it.\n\nThe idea is to polarize the public. That way, a portion of the public wouldn\u2019t want to consume our content at all, but the rest would love it.\n\nThis discussion reminds of \u201c1000 true fans\u201d who are ready to purchase whatever product a creative puts out. I don\u2019t think that we can create 1000 true fans by trying to please everybody.\n\nWhat Do the Numbers Say?\n\nIn order to back my ideas with stats, I made an analysis of my last 111 Medium posts. I calculated the clap to view ratio of these posts. Then, I calculated the correlation between the views and the clap to view ratio. This correlation was -40%.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we have an inverse correlation, but it doesn\u2019t show a positive correlation either. What my reader suggests might be true.\n\nI can see this relationship clearly in my most engaging and least engaging ten posts. By most engaging, I mean the posts with the highest claps per views ratios. The least engaging posts are the ones that have the least number of claps per view.\n\nMy most engaging posts aren\u2019t the wildly popular ones. On the other hand, most of my least engaging posts have above average views.\n\nWhen I look at my least engaging posts, I see that some of them are among \u201cmy most hated posts.\u201d I already wrote a post about why those posts had low fans to views ratio.\n\nI\u2019m intrigued by the most engaging posts. Even though I analyzed all kinds of stats, these posts didn\u2019t show up in my radar.\n\nI suspect that a high read ratio contributes to engaging posts. I\u2019m going to analyze what made these posts so engaging and report that in a future post.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to miss my post on writing engaging posts, sign up to my email newsletter. Once a week, I send an email that contains my latest posts on writing, blogging, marketing, entrepreneurship, productivity, and personal development.\n\nI thank Michael K. Spencer for recommending me to look at the average claps per article and Catherine Turner for her question that inspired me to write this post.\n\nAs copywriters, bloggers, and marketers, our aim isn\u2019t necessarily to be wildly popular. Our aim is to get our readers to take action at the bottom of our funnels. This can be following us on social media, subscribing to our email newsletter, and purchasing our products.\n\nIf you want to create 1000 true fans, you might want to let go of trying to please everybody. You might want to be unique in your own way.\n\nAs a result, you might be less popular with the general public, but you might end up with 1000 true fans who are in love with your work and willing to support you in every way possible."

        "text": "Creatives take dictation from divine. So they say.\n\nNon-designers would agree that they mostly aren\u2019t in a position to see sense in this process. They with best of their intentions, would rather pick certainty over this self-proclaimed unsure process.\n\nAnd between the two spaces is what this article is going to talk about.\n\nWhat do the two terms mean wrt to this article?\n\nProficiency : Proficiency of a designer, how much a designer knows to use her faculties/tools.\n\nBoth are important, but don\u2019t you think perception takes one farther? More than proficiency alone could take one? Oh! come on.\n\nThis is true for almost everything. Let\u2019s not contest that, man is a social animal.\n\nAs of today, perception building might happen superficially, mainly because of consumption of enough redundant data regularly.\n\nBest talent recruiters are still learning to decode hiring designers.\n\nRegarding design, we are in a place where we are yet to form a quantitative understanding of skills associated.\n\nCurrently, with respect to design, people are chosen by hunch. \n\nMore hunch than what happens in other fields.\n\nDesign Thinking is one skill which has made so much noise, that I fear to point it as my skill. \n\nI, in fact, find it funny. I was attending Make in India, CNN IBN Young turks media session, the anchor was introduced as a design thinker. Every one claims to have their own \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d process.\n\nDesign as a skill has remained isolated coz of it\u2019s very own nature.\n\nWe as a community are improving but I guess it\u2019s safe to say, that there is a certain mis-match of expectations from both sides.\n\nTo understand a designer/ artist\u2019s perspective, let\u2019s listen to what Elizabeth Gilbert has to say in her TED2009 talk called \u201cYour elusive creative genius\u201d\n\nPeople believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity \u201cdaemons.\u201d Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.\n\n\u201d\n\nAnd now let\u2019s understand this from a Chief/Chef\u2019s perspective, the one who has to \u2014 has to let things in the pipeline running to provide adequate food.\n\nA Chef can not wait for a Dobby to give dictation. He has to provide more basic needs and would rather prefer putting up a plate without a sweet.\n\nThis expectation mis-match is the major reason why average work happens.\n\nI don\u2019t have answers to this expectation mis-match coz I find it more of a WIP but I can tell you how I work around it.\n\nFrom my experience of working at a creative digital consultancy, I try and do work in steps. Every step is a complete step i.e work done at every step is complete to provide for basic processes to be running.\n\nThis helps creative process not hinder the more basic process. And thus buying time for Dobby to answer.\n\nI hope this helps in plotting points into your graph of designers vs your next hire.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback.\n\nWrite to me at work.with.shiva@gmail.com."

        "title": "5 Steps to Building a Brand \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "We hear the term \u201cbrand\u201d thrown into conversation right the way from our daily commute through to senior board level, but what does \u201cbrand\u201d really mean and what have we learned throughout our journey at SYZO?\n\nMany of us (unless you\u2019ve lived in a bubble) are familiar with the likes of Apple, McDonalds and Hilton whom are global experts in leveraging a perceived value of quality, taste and experience when encountered. To those in the startup scene though, brand is a hard fought and increasing earned badge of honour, one that doesn\u2019t come easily and is lost with the slightest of failures.\n\nWhen defining \u201cbrand\u201d though, it\u2019s hard to stay focused in the context of startup business. For most, brand is defined by the ability to slap an eye watering price tag on a product or service. As advocates of critical thinking, meaningful growth and the sharing economy, we found most resonance in the words of Seth Godin. Seth, to those who are unfamiliar (stop reading this and follow him across social media) underpins the modern paradigm of marketing. Cutting through the jargon his openly direct approach and plethora of well placed, fashionable content provides an industry leading Gold Standard to trained and untrained folk.\n\nSpeaking in his acclaimed bestseller Permission Marketing, Seth defines brand as;\n\n\u201cthe set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer\u2019s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer (whether it\u2019s a business, a buyer or a voter) doesn\u2019t pay a premium, make a selection or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer.\u201d\n\nTaking this forward, our engagement with aspiring brand consultants, agencies, business psychologists and most importantly our \u201ctribe\u201d of potential members, has cemented our fabric and propelled us forward.\n\nHere\u2019s a selection of our key takeaways from humble beginnings up until today, as we look to push SYZO forward:\n\n1. Build a vision that resonates through the entire business\n\n\u00b7 Consider what is driving the business, revisit the business plan and ensure your mission statement is up to date\n\n\u00b7 Research brands within your niche, undertake a SWOT analysis and log their movement (don\u2019t be afraid to stalk your competitors)\n\n\u00b7 Develop a consistent message and visual identity to reinforce your mission\n\n\u00b7 When building your brand, think of it as a person\n\n\u00b7 Create this as a collective team in a social setting for expanded lateral thinking\n\n\u00b7 Create a Tone of Voice document to give examples of your current written language (Your voice is dependent on your company mission, audience, and industry)\n\n\u00b7 Define how you communicate with your customers and how they respond to you\n\n\u00b7 A business voice could be professional, friendly, informal or service orientated (to name a few)\n\n\u00b7 Form a consensus narrative. Sell yourself in one sentence and expand this pitch for captivating audiences\n\n\u00b7 Engage with an agency, rock star designer or marketing guru once you\u2019ve learnt how to communicate with a creative and have some substance\n\n\u00b7 We advise you quickly learn that timescales are often broken in this world of out of the box thinking!\n\n\u00b7 Create Brand Guidelines to iron out differences in the team, focus your design and visual preferences\n\n\u00b7 Implement these rules from email banners up to billboards\n\n\u00b7 Ensure quarterly updates to these documents are maintained\n\n\u00b7 There will always be brands with bigger budgets and more resources to command their industry. Delve down deep and figure out what you offer, that no one else does, define your USP and value added in your sector\n\n\u00b7 Strategise, visualise and repeat. Without continual iteration you cannot keep the brand interpretation on point and as a result risk losing your identity\n\nA solid brand building process can transform your startup from a small player into a successful competitor. We\u2019re not claiming to be the next brand agency but we\u2019ve certainly learnt a lot the past 18 months through doing it first hand. With the right approach, building a brand doesn\u2019t need a 6 figure budget, but it does need a core understanding and respect for the bigger picture.\n\nFor SYZO, brand shapes our personality and interaction outside the business. From the visual presence through to the tone of voice when dealing with conflict or criticism, the way a startup embraces brand is ultimately a key indicator to it\u2019s future potential.\n\nWant to know more about our brand development?

        "text": "Meaning will transform your business. Here\u2019s why.\n\nUsually, when someone starts up a business or new product, they start with an idea. Then they get people on-board with what they want to do, figure out a name, have a logo designed, get a website and so on. These are all necessary and important steps in getting an idea off the ground, but they are putting the cart before the horse.\n\nYour WHY is the horse.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the surface WHY, like \u201cI need to earn money\u201d or \u201cI need a job\u201d, I\u2019m talking about your deeper purpose or belief that is more meaningful than what you do or how you do it. At Remote, we believe that meaning drives purpose and purpose drives business transformation.\n\nEveryone has a deeper WHY, and while we might might go on to create some custom software for a client, we now first help them to make their WHY conscious. Why? Because whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, a leader of a team or an employee, before you can be motivated to do your best work, you need to understand WHY you are doing it.\n\nFor example, we\u2019re all about delivering great software that has a positive impact upon peoples working life. We spend much of our life in the workplace. Without a WHY, our working life becomes a meaningless grind: Wake up, go to work, do work, moan about it, earn money, come home, eat, watch TV, go to bed, wake up and repeat. So, without a WHY, there\u2019s no chance any software we might create is going to have a positive impact on someone\u2019s working life.\n\nOnce you have articulated your WHY, it will give meaning and that meaning will inspire you and your team. It will provide the foundation of your company culture and inform every decision and every action you make \u2014 including where custom software might improve your working practices, processes or product delivery.\n\nThis realisation isn\u2019t new or unique. It was made more popular by Simon Sinek\u2019s TED Talk in 2009. Inspired by Simon and the work that Daniel Priestley does with entrepreneurs at Dent, we\u2019ve made it central to the work what we do at Remote.\n\nWith a sense of meaning, you and your whole team will feel a sense of purpose \u2014 valued, supported, united and inspired to create a positive and productive work environment, where trust and collaboration make a positive and lasting impact.\n\nIt will mean that you and your colleagues are not driven by superficial ideas or desires, like money or success, but are instead inspired by a deeper purpose to do meaningful work.\n\nBeing driven will exhaust you. It will result in you and your colleagues slaving away for long hours just doing busy work. This approach is unsustainable and unattractive, and so it will inevitably be short-lived.\n\nBeing inspired by your deeper reason will fuel you, and guide you and your team to do the right work. Making a greater, positive impact on not only yourselves and your organisation, but also the world.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve really grokked your personal and unique WHY, and your organisation\u2019s WHY, the meaning it gives can be communicated to all your stakeholders, colleagues and customers via the name, logo, website, blog and other assets, giving those assets depth. Because when an organisation understands their WHY, their work has real meaning and they have a brand that communicates what they stand for that is of true value in the world.\n\nYour WHY can also then inform your environment, your processes and exactly how you can apply tools, such as software, to make work more enjoyable and more productive, driving business transformation.\n\nFinding your WHY involves asking yourself a lot of questions about what you do, and getting beneath the answers to the deeper motivating force behind them. Doing this can seem abstract, esoteric, futile and impossible at times, but it\u2019s my bet that everyone feels like that at first \u2014 I know we did \u2014 so stick with it.\n\nYou might find it difficult to distinguish between what you do, how you do it and why you do it at first, because we\u2019re submerged in a society that stresses the what and the how and gives little to no credence to the WHY. Keep going though, because your WHY is there, just waiting to be discovered.\n\nFrom my own experience, creating a kind of funnel of questioning might help, a bit like this:\n\nWhen our team at Remote understood their personal and our collective WHY, good things started to happen. We felt valued. We felt invigorated. We started to develop a deeper sense of trust. We started to work together to create better processes. We became more autonomous, more innovative, more organised and more productive. We began to communicate our WHY to our customers, and we started to grow. People understood what sets us apart from other software development companies and they wanted to work with us an and be a part of our team. And our people started to enjoy coming to work.\n\nWe believe that understanding your WHY will help your company drive cross-organisational business transformation, just like ours has for us, and we can\u2019t wait to see how far you go."

He broke his back and several other bones in his body and is paralysed.\n\nUndeterred (!), Luttrell starts pulling himself forward with his hands. \u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d he tells himself. \u201cThat means the mission is still on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He takes a rock and draws a line in the sand as far ahead as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll crawl over this line until my feet hit it. If I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n\nThe end result? Covering seven miles of terrain on his hands until he was eventually found by Pashtun villagers.\n\nLuttrell had a big goal (get to safety and complete his mission) and all the cards against him. If he focused on the end result and the scope of that goal, there would be forces of resistance that would discourage him; fear, pain, hopelessness, fatigue.\n\nWhat did he do? He focused on the few feet in front of him, conquered that, rinsed and repeated.\n\nWe all have these great goals, missions and plans for our lives. The sheer size of these goals bring about similar forces of resistance; procrastination, fear, self-sabotage, shame.\n\nBut what if we focused on one small task? Execute that one task and repeat? What kind of result would that bring?\n\nSo my suggestion is this:\n\nWe set out to achieve large goals and large dreams but we not take action! So draw your line in the sand. A goal so small, so achievable, that you would be ashamed of yourself if you didn\u2019t do it.\n\nThen do it again.\n\nWhen Albert Einstein called compound interest the \u201cmost powerful force in the universe,\u201d he was not talking about money. He was talking about effort.\n\nTake a look at that big goal you have, then forget about it. Make a small goal and go knock it out. Then do it again. And again. Focus on what\u2019s in front of you. That\u2019s it!\n\nIf you got this far, thank you so much! If you got this far and liked it, feel free to applaud :)"

        "text": "The Fallacy Behind \u201cI\u2019m Just Not Creative\u201d\n\nIt seems to be a common belief in our society that creativity is a trait that nature bestows upon a lucky few individuals. Pop neuroscience books and magazines assert that the era of the right-brain has arrived. The world belongs to the 10% of humanity that is left-handed, the creatives. Meanwhile, the rest of us should just take our narrow minds and spreadsheets and crunch our numbers somewhere else.\n\nUnfortunately, this view is so pervasive that I have encountered bright people limit their problem solving potential by quickly claiming \u201cI can\u2019t figure it out. I\u2019m just not creative.\u201d This belief is so ingrained that they do not even attempt to solve the problems that confront them.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why people adopt the fallacy that some people are born creative, while others never will or can be:\n\nFirst, society preaches that some people just have that \u201cit\u201d factor. They have that je ne sais quoi. They are born savants with natural ability. While that may be true for a few, this does not mean that creativity cannot be learned. Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther and Fruitvale Station, did not start as a child film prodigy like many other Hollywood directors. He went to college with the intention to play football and to study chemistry. Thanks to the encouragement of his astute English professor, he eventually went on to study screenwriting and film. The rest is history.\n\nSecond, it is an easy escape from challenging work. The act of creating something new takes hard work. Any physics student will tell you that one of the fundamental laws of the universe is that total entropy or chaos increases over time in an isolated system. In order to reverse the process, it takes energy to to produce order from chaos. Using your past experiences and influences to develop a coherent and novel message, in any medium, requires organization, vision, dedication, and effort.\n\nThird, the ego gets in the way. I have seen colleagues balk at relatively simple tasks like designing flyers, project posters, and even power point presentations just because they have seen someone else do a better job. They are afraid that somehow it is a reflection on their character if their work does not match up. However, once you recognize that creativity requires the suspension of the ego, it will be easier to take the necessary risks. Since artists are notoriously bad at judging their own work, you will never know how good you can be if you do not try!\n\nFourth, people feel like they never have enough knowledge. This is one of the biggest reasons why many people do not achieve their dreams. They feel like they need to study art history before trying to paint or learn everything they can about publishing a book before they actually write a word. When I started my podcast, I did not spend too much time researching the history and theory behind podcasting. I just bought some microphones, found a subject, and started recording on my computer. I learned by doing. By trial and error.\n\nFifth, they are perfectionists. What people sometimes fail to realize is that art is messy. So they become frustrated when their first attempts at creating do not match up with the finished works of the artists they see in museums or social media. When Kehinde Wiley unveiled his portrait of Barack Obama for the National Portrait Gallery, critics lauded it for its originality and symbolism. However, we did not see his drafts, his mistakes, and even the behind-the-scenes criticism he might have received from President Obama. Give up your desire to be perfect. Life and art are way more enjoyable if you can forgive yourself.\n\nCreativity is the process where disparate ideas or thoughts are synthesized to generate a new, coherent idea. Anyone can learn to be creative. The main ingredients are curiosity and the willingness to repeatedly try. Ignore the naysayers and pseudoscience. Further, studies have shown that the right brain versus left brain theories are unsubstantiated. Albert Einstein said\n\nSo don\u2019t give yourself such a hard time. After all, nature blessed you too.\n\nThis post was originally published on my website at www.bassamzahid.com. If you enjoyed it, please share! Follow me on Twitter or Instagram."

        "title": "MVP \u2014 A Strategy That is Pure Gold! \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "When bringing a product to market, research and testing is necessary all along the way to ensure you have a viable product that people want to buy, and then marketing and positioning the final product in such a way that people line up to buy what you are selling. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is an incremental development method by which a product is developed with just enough features to be able to test in the marketplace to obtain information relative to the desire for and validity of said product. An MVP should be part of any product development strategy, and especially software development.\n\nAs part of the initial market research process, information should be obtained through as many channels as possible. Additionally, information gleaned through the use of a landing page marketed to a target audience cannot be overstated when considering development of an MVP. The purpose of a landing page is to describe the core features of your software application and capture contact information for potential early adopters who will be asked for assistance with testing the MVP, as well as providing notification of when the final product is released.\n\nIf the landing page was marketed properly and conversion rates are horrible, then Outfast Source recommends more market research be performed before a single line of code is written. On the other hand, if conversion rates on the landing page are good, you then move to development of a product with, as Steve Blank, the Godfather of the Lean Startup Movement defines it, \u201ca minimum feature set,\u201d which will allow you to test your hypothesis, i.e. your belief that there is, in fact, a need for your application in the marketplace; and more importantly, that there is an interest in it. Once testing is complete on the first iteration of your MVP, form a new hypothesis, and then build out just enough new features to once again test your hypothesis. With each product iteration, you learn more about what the market wants and what they are willing to pay for.\n\nMaking MVP development part of your overall software development strategy enables you to develop and even roll out an application incrementally in a sandbox-type environment. Typically in software development, the sandbox refers to a testing environment where experimental and untested code is isolated from the live version of an application.\n\nIn the past, one type of sandbox was the BETA version of a complete application which was built for a very targeted market share and was rolled out to a very small group of potential early adopters for testing to discover bugs, confirm processes functionality and market-specific terminology, and make recommendations on improving the user experience, i.e. user interface and intuitiveness of the application. This was a long and arduous process, and in many cases, involved someone from the software development company actually working at the testing site. In many instances code that was already written under assumptions made as a result of initial research had to be reworked when the application was deployed and folks actually started going through the workflow processes. Additionally, this small group of early adopters would often drive the development of an application locking in a particular market share perhaps, but in today\u2019s global market the sandbox needs to be big enough for a whole bunch of folks to play in.\n\nWhen the application being tested is mammoth and completely coded, all the capital is spent at the onset of the project so the sandbox ends up being much smaller. When using an MVP as part of your overall development strategy, and especially when bringing a new software application to market, your sandbox becomes much bigger; and you gain more exposure to many different potential markets, which is HUGE when considering initial product traction. Even if not addressing different markets, there may be more use cases within a given market than you were considering, or the use cases may be different than you thought.\n\nAs mentioned above, part of using MVP as a software development strategy involves utilization of potential early adopters. Early Adopters are typically early users of a product or service, and as such, are viewed as trend-setters. These folks would be the early users of a new products and services like TRAVO and Uber. Early adopters not only test the product, but they provide feedback relative to the type of functionality and even the emotional triggers and intel necessary for the development of a real revenue stream.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s say you have an idea for a travel planning tool you think there is a market for. Converting potential early adopters to early adopters/customers and even an addition to your sales toolbox might go something like this:\n\nSimply put, making an MVP part of your development strategy is paramount to managing runway efficiency. Data mining and gathering intel to formulate the marketing message of a product through the use of an MVP development strategy is far less expensive than developing a software application with everything AND the kitchen sink, which increases cost and risk. Consider the following specific points from a cost-savings/risk perspective:\n\nUsing MVP as part of your overall development strategy is a no-brainer. Your hypothesis can be built and tested with fewer resources and lesser risk because the iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, user experience, user interface (presentation), data collection to include emotional triggers that convert early adopters and prospects to buyers, analysis and learning continues until a product/market fit marriage is found or the product is determined to be non-viable. Using an MVP approach significantly reduces rework and helps to ensure that the right product is delivered at the right time.\n\nGot an idea for the next big app? AWAKEN YOUR INNER ENTREPRENEUR! Contact a software developer today to see what it would take to get to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and make that launch date a reality!\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Outfast Source Blog."

        "title": "Want To Be More Creative? Get High. \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Want To Be More Creative? Get High.\n\nWhether it\u2019s hard-drinking writers like Capote, Kerouac, and Cheever, over-caffeinated creatives like Bach, Beethoven, and Balzac, or drug-addled rockers like Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain, the figure of the intoxicated artist remains a powerful motif in the mythology of the creative class.\n\nNow, we could debate if the taste for mind-altering substances among high-achieving creatives is a cause or effect of their chosen line of work. We could also plumb the academic research to see if a scientific basis for connecting substance intake with increased idea formation is borne out by the data. Or we could reframe the whole concept of psychologically-induced creative heights by heeding a recent study that found that professional stock traders working on high floors in skyscrapers take greater risks in their work than those toiling on lower stories.\n\nWhat, you might ask, has stock trading to do with creativity?\n\nPlenty. For starters, both stock trading and creativity involve unpredictable outcomes. No trader on Earth can predict with certainty that a particular stock price will rise in the future; whatever money gets invested in the market is therefore vulnerable to loss.\n\nInnovators face similar unpredictability and exposure. As much as we might wish otherwise, the algorithm that can determine in advance if our new startup venture, book, painting, or pancake recipe will be accepted by its audience has not yet been invented. Anything we produce could conceivably be rejected and, for all intents and purposes, disappear from view. Nor does previous success render us immune from having later work censured; as with the stock market, past performance is no guarantee of future results. (Just ask one-hit or one-time wonders Margaret Mitchell, ? and the Mysterians, and every high-flying startup from the dot com era to have since collapsed.)\n\nThe pitfalls of uncertain consequences can prove especially damaging for those who dare to break strongly with convention. The engineer Gustav Eiffel was severely attacked when he proposed the iron-latticed tower that bears his name for the masonry environs of the low-rise city of Paris. Van Gogh barely sold any paintings in his lifetime. Copernicus\u2019 theory of a heliocentric universe was not a big hit when he first floated it.\n\nTrading and creativity share a second characteristic intrinsic to risky ventures: they both involve high stakes. For the trader, there\u2019s the perpetual prospect of financial ruin. For the creative, it\u2019s a lingering threat of failure and everything that comes in its wake: diminished self-esteem and motivation, loss of reputation, reduced income or access to opportunity, ridicule, and social condemnation.\n\nOkay, so stock trading and creativity share the element of risk. Are we therefore to infer from this new study that we creatives could up our game by perching ourselves above the ground plane?\n\nAs a matter of fact, yes. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve had evidence hinting at this effect for quite some time now.\n\nBack in 2007, for instance, two scientists from the University of British Columbia ran in experiment in which it was discovered that people are more adept at solving creative problems while working under a ten-foot ceiling than under an eight-foot one. Subsequent research showed similar results when people are given access to views, exposed to the color blue, look at memorabilia, or dress more formally.\n\nThe common thread among these conditions is the element of distance. In the cases of ceiling height and views, it is distance in its literal meaning of physical dimension. With blue, it\u2019s the allusion to depth rather than actual feet and inches, blue surfaces conveying the illusion of receding from the eye (a naturally occuring optical phenomenon Leonardo exploited to depict a distant landscape in the upper third of the Mona Lisa). The nostalgic contemplation of artifacts from the past similarly instills a sense of distance in our minds, only now in the currency of time rather than in the metrics of space.\n\nAs for dress, scientists theorize that donning relatively formal clothes (think three-piece business suit versus cut-offs and a tank top) induce a psychological effect in both wearer and observer called social distancing. According to this theory, the more formal the clothing we wear, the more apart we perceive ourselves to be from others, and them from us. Conversely, the more casual our attire, the more approachable and less distant we appear.\n\nVery interesting. But how does the intuition of distance, however it might be implanted in our minds, tie into risk-taking and creativity?\n\nThe famous Ferris wheel scene from the film The Third Man could provide the answer.\n\nThe scene has Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten riding a giant wheel in an amusement park in post-War Vienna. They\u2019re high above the ground when Welles points down to a scattering of fairgoers below. The character questions whether Cotten would honestly feel sympathy if any of the \u201cdots\u201d moving on the ground were to die. In other words, for Welles, people aren\u2019t sentient, living beings, but abstractions. The problem is that the Welles character literally believes this, treating the victims of his criminal schemes as no more than \u201cdots\u201d in his pursuit of financial gain.\n\nThe Welles character is right about one thing, though: objects viewed from a distant vantage point necessarily morph into abstractions, since the eye can no longer make out small-scale detail or texture. It\u2019s also true that seeing things from far away implies that the observer has a big-picture perspective, because the farther back we are from the object of our attention, the wider the physical expanse captured by our cone of vision.\n\nHere\u2019s where creativity, high-risk stock trading, elevated vantage points, and distance begin to intersect.\n\nPoint one: Our brains are susceptible to shifts in cognitive style depending on the inputs entering our consciousness through the five senses, a triggering effect known as brain priming.\n\nPoint two: Primes that cue intimations of distance, whether physical, social, or temporal, lead us to think more abstractly, i.e., in a big picture mode, because of the association our brains have forged between physical distance and its optical effects.\n\nPoint three: Creative thinking is by nature abstract and big-picture; primes that cue perceptions of distance therefore stimulate creative thinking.\n\nPoint four: To be creative necessitates maintaining an open mind, exploring boundaries, and tolerating risk.\n\nPoint five: Stock trading entails varying levels of hazard depending on the trader\u2019s appetite for risk.\n\nPoint six: Traders are more likely to exhibit explorative, open-minded, and risk-tolerant behavior when primed by the optics of distance and expansiveness than traders cued by intimations of proximity and spatial containment.\n\nPoint seven: Comparatively speaking, people generally will be more adept at finding creative solutions to problems when positioned high above the ground plane than when they are close to it."

        "title": "Hyperledger \u2014 Chapter 5 | Tuna Fishing Supplychain - Context",
        "text": "After each catch, Sarah records information about each individual tuna, including: a unique ID number, the location and time of the catch, its weight, the vessel type, and who caught the fish. For the sake of simplicity, we will stick with these six data attributes. However, in an actual application, many more details would be recorded, from toxicology, to other physical characteristics.\n\nThese details are saved in the world state as a key/value pair based on the specifications of a chaincode contract, allowing Sarah\u2019s application to effectively create a transaction on the ledger. You can see the example below:\n\nMiriam is a restaurant owner looking to source low cost, yet high quality tuna that have been responsibly caught. Whenever Miriam buys tuna, she is always uncertain whether she can trust that the tuna she is purchasing is legally and sustainably caught, given the prominence of illegal and unreported tuna fishing.\n\nAt the same time, as a legitimate and experienced fisherman, Sarah strives to make a living selling her tuna at a reasonable price. She would also like autonomy over who she sells to and at what price.\n\nNormally, Sarah sells her tuna to restaurateurs, such as Carl, for $80 per pound. However, Sarah agrees to give Miriam a special price of $50 per pound of tuna, rather than her usual rate. In a traditional public blockchain, once Sarah and Miriam have completed their transaction, the entire network is able to view the details of this agreement, especially the fact that Sarah gave Miriam a special price. As you can imagine, having other restaurateurs, such as Carl, aware of this deal is not economically advantageous for Sarah.\n\nTo remedy this, Sarah wants the specifics of her deal to not be available to everyone on the network, but still have every actor in the network be able to view the details of the fish she is selling. Using Hyperledger Fabric\u2019s feature of channels, Sarah can privately agree on the terms with Miriam, such that only the two of them can see them, without anyone else knowing the specifics.\n\nAdditionally, other fishermen, who are not part of Sarah and Miriam\u2019s transaction, will not see this transaction on their ledger. This ensures that another fisherman cannot undercut the bid by having information about the prices that Sarah is charging different restaurateurs.\n\nRegulators will also gain entry to this Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network to confirm, verify, and view details from the ledger. Their application will allow these actors to query the ledger and see the details of each of Sarah\u2019s catches to confirm that she is legally catching her fish.\n\nRegulators only need to have query access, and do not need to add entries to the ledger. With that being said, they may be able to adjust who can gain entry to the network and/or be able to remove fishermen from the network, if found to be partaking in illegal activities.\n\nHyperledger Fabric is a permissioned network, meaning that only participants who have been approved can gain entry to the network. To handle network membership and identity, membership service providers (MSP) manage user IDs, and authenticate all the participants in the network.\n\nIn our scenario, the regulator, the approved fishermen, and the approved restaurateurs should be the only ones allowed to join the network.\n\nOur scenario has two separate chaincodes, which are run on three separate channels.\n\nEach member of this network knows about each other and their identity. The channels provide privacy and confidentiality of transactions.\n\nBelow is a summary of the tuna catch scenario presented in this section:"

        "title": "How to Become an Entrepreneur: 9 Lessons for Noobs \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "On June 14th 2016, my business partner and I founded Immersion Arcade \u2014 the United State\u2019s first HTC Vive virtual reality arcade. We were open for 4 months and made $17,000+ in revenue before pivoting. Since this was my first foray into the startup world, I learned a lot through trial-and-error.\n\nIn this article, I wanted to share the most valuable lessons that stand out in hindsight. This article is intended for those who want to become an entrepreneur, but have little-to-no experience \u2014 in other words, for myself two years ago.\n\nWhen I first committed to the arcade, I didn\u2019t think of myself as an entrepreneur at all. I had no problem thinking of my business partner Brian Jesse as an entrepreneur; he was a wiz-kid programmer who five years earlier left a comfy job at Wolfram to pursue the startup world. Me on the other hand\u2026 I was a Fine Arts professor who never took a business class in my life!\n\nEvery time I told Brian that I felt like a phony, and that I had no idea what I was doing, he responded, \u201cAVERAGE PEOPLE START BUSINESSES.\u201d\n\nHe reminded me that every business was started by someone who, at one point, was not a business owner. Business owners aren\u2019t born knowing how to business, just as pianists aren\u2019t born knowing how to piano. They are ordinary people who decided to take the leap and have been figuring it out ever since.\n\nArmed with this phrase and Amy Cuddy\u2019s TED Talk, I decided to fake being a business owner. And one day, I was a business owner.\n\nAnother phrase I relied upon in my early days was inspired by something Kevin Kelly said on \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Show\u201d:\n\nAlthough Kelly aimed this advice for the fields of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, I believe it translates at large. Anyone can become an expert if they decide on a niche, explore it regularly, and share what they learn.\n\nKelly referred to Kent Bye as an example. In 2014, Bye started recording interviews at VR conferences and releasing them as the Voices of VR Podcast. Now, he has recorded over 750 interviews and runs the podcast full-time! He\u2019s become an expert, all because he regularly explores a niche with others and shares what he learns. (If you are interested in VR, I highly encourage you check out the podcast and support Kent via his Patreon!)\n\nEven if your field is well-established, you can become an expert of a unique sub-niche within the field. In his book The 4-Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss said to think of two separate niches you are a part of, and connect them. For instance, you could become an expert of VR and yoga, AI and veterinary science, AR and natural building, Plato and cooking, and so on. The more disconnected the niches, the more pivotal your work will be.\n\nAustin Kleon summed this up in his book Show Your Work! when he said:\n\nIf you are brand new to entrepreneurship and take nothing else from this article, seriously consider joining a coworking space. A coworking space is essentially an office shared by multiple entrepreneurs, including freelancers, small business owners, and remote corporate workers.\n\nWhen I was getting started, my coworkers taught me every foundational business principle I needed to know. They were like a council of experts that I could ask for advice at any time. Everyone had specific strengths that I could utilize when I was out of my element, and everyone could utilize my own strengths when they were out of their element.\n\nWhen we needed to form an LLC, a peer walked us through the process since he\u2019d recently done it for his startup. When we needed an email list, another peer explained MailChimp. When we were launching a crowdfunding campaign, another peer reflected on his experience launching one and sent us his collection of articles about best practices.\n\nAs Tim Ferriss once said on his podcast, there\u2019s two ways to track down the solution to a problem. The less efficient way is to research the answer. The more efficient way is to ask someone who knows the answer.\n\nAnother reason to join a coworking space is because it will grow your network, and networking is everything. To illustrate, let me share a story.\n\nOur coworking space hosted a 1 Million Cups speaker series every Wednesday at 8am. One morning, I struck up conversation with a woman and man at my table. When I mentioned the VR arcade, their interest heightened and they bombarded me with questions. It turns out, she was Head of IT for our home town and he was Assistant to the City Manager. They thought there was potential for a partnership between us, so we arranged a follow-up meeting.\n\nFast-forward to the meeting. Both of them show up\u2026 and so does the director of the public library, the marketing director of the library, the exhibit manager of the children\u2019s museum, and the mayor! We were stunned. We explained our vision and gave demos to all. (Here\u2019s a clip of the mayor in VR during this meeting.) After that, we ran VR for every town event, which attracted tons of new customers to our arcade and even got us featured on the local news.\n\nThe moral of this story: Had I slept in that day, or stayed quiet at my table, I would have missed this opportunity completely.\n\nMore examples of networking that paid off:\n\nAs Derek Sivers said in his article \u201cHow to get rich\u201d:\n\nStarting a business is a high-risk endeavor\u2014but not all risk is inevitable. Some risk can be avoided. To distinguish between inevitable and avoidable risk, you must learn what has and hasn\u2019t worked for others. This means that if you are brand new to the startup world\u2026 you have a lot of catching up to do!\n\nAfter I committed to the arcade, I constantly listened to entrepreneurial podcasts, audiobooks, and YouTube videos. I recommend noobs constantly surround themselves with educational media because, if you are the average of the five people you most associate with, you may as well digitally surround yourself with successful entrepreneurs as much as possible.\n\nI personally love audio media because I can passively learn while carrying out the mundane activities of daily life. A story about this: When I first joined my coworking space, a coworker recommended I read Peter Thiel\u2019s \u201cZero to One.\u201d I bought the audiobook and listened to it twice over the next few weeks, putting it on whenever I was walking, driving, cleaning, getting ready, etc. Later, I found out that my coworker had a physical copy of the book and hadn\u2019t even finished reading it yet\u2026 so eventually I was sharing lessons with him which he hadn\u2019t gotten to!\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve always surrounded myself with educational media, I noticed two things changed when I committed to the arcade. The first was I could immediately apply what I learned to my business, which helped me better understand the information. According to Edgar Dale\u2019s Cone of Experience, we remember 20% of what we hear and 90% of what we do. My business served as a sandbox where I could \u201cactively do\u201d what I was learning.\n\nThe second was that I became more valuable to everyone else in my coworking space, since I could relay what I\u2019d learned with them. Sharing what you learn is a mutually beneficial arrangement: the other person gets free guidance, you reinforce your understanding of the advice, and it helps to establish a friendly relationship between you, growing both of your networks.\n\nBefore you invest in your startup, learn about lean startup methodology. Watch YouTube videos, read Eric Ries book, read articles, listen to podcasts, and talk with others about it. It can be a complex subject to wrap your head around, but the more you apply it, the more likely your startup will succeed.\n\nThe core idea is this: Don\u2019t spend $100,000 building a product, then release it and hope people will buy it. Instead spend $1000, or $100, or $10 building a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d (MVP) which does just enough to be marketable. Then release your MVP, gather market feedback, and use that feedback to figure out how to best invest in your product moving forward.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t make something then see if people will buy it.\n\nSee what people will buy then make that!\n\nMaybe people will use your MVP as you intended, but maybe they won\u2019t. Maybe a feature you thought would be popular is never used. Maybe it\u2019s used by a totally different demographic than you expected. This is why you build MVPs fast and cheap; you need real market feedback so you know you aren\u2019t wasting your time and money building something nobody wants.\n\nSo let\u2019s say you\u2019re starting a VR arcade and want to totally disregard the lean startup approach. You could sign a 5-year lease for a massive space in the heart of downtown and fill it with 16 HTC Vives running on the best computers with the best commercially-licensed games available. Hell, why not throw in a few SUBPAC\u2019s and Virtuix Omni\u2019s while you\u2019re at it!\n\nIf your arcade succeeds\u2026 Yippee!! Hooray!! I\u2019m so happy for you!!!\n\nBut if it fails, you are now $200,000 in debt.\n\nSo now let\u2019s say you want to use a lean approach. You could buy one HTC Vive with a decent computer, sign up to the Steam Site Licensing Program for free, and install one commercially-licensed copy of The Lab, which is also free. You can practice running VR demos for friends and family, and then once you get the hang of it, do free VR demos for local businesses and the public library. Bring business cards and promotional materials to pass out, and have an email list people can sign up to. Eventually, someone is bound to want to book you for their own private event. Let them, and charge them a high fee.\n\nNow you have hard evidence of market demand, a list of potential future clients, networking connections with local businesses and the library, and you\u2019re making a return on your investment\u2026 all for maybe $3000.\n\nThe table below illustrates more realistic costs of this hypothetical scenario, including a more reasonable 3-year lease and insurance:\n\nNote: The reason I\u2019ve only mentioned the HTC Vive and not the Oculus Rift is because Oculus does not allow commercial use of the Rift, in accordance with sections 3.1 and 4.1 of their terms of service.\n\nLet\u2019s say you and three friends are starting a company. Awesome! Now, how do you decide how much equity each person gets? How do you \u201cslice the pie\u201d?\n\nAt first you might think, \u201cWell, let\u2019s split the company equally between all four of us.\u201d That sounds fair\u2026 until you fast forward a few months or years, and one founder puts in 75% of the daily work and the others barely do anything anymore. What seemed fair at the time, doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nWhen Brian and I started the business, we split the company 50/50. It worked great for us\u2026 but after a few months, our business had grown a lot, so we wanted to bring more people onto our team. But now\u2026 what do we do about the equity? We\u2019d worked our butts off building the business from nothing\u2026 so how much of \u201cthe pie\u201d should we give to a newcomer?\n\nWhen I asked this question to our advisor Doan Winkel (who runs this awesome Teaching Entrepreneurship blog), he recommended I read Mike Moyer\u2019s \u201cSlicing Pie: Funding Your Company without Funds.\u201d This book provides a universal equity model that solves this problem.\n\nThe \u201cslicing pie\u201d model is complex enough to warrant buying the book, but the basic idea is equity should be rewarded to each person based on the amount of time and money each invests. It uses a dynamic approach to equity, meaning that it changes in real-time based on everyone\u2019s investments. In other words, the more you put into the company, the more equity you get out of it\u2014relative to everyone else\u2019s investments.\n\nTo learn more, check out this video of Mike Moyer summarizing the model.\n\nHad we used the \u201cslicing pie\u201d equity model from day one, we would\u2019ve known exactly how much equity each newcomer deserved.\n\nI recommend all startups incorporate the Mike Moyer | Slicing Pie model into the company as early as possible. Even if you are a solo entrepreneur, but there\u2019s the remote possibility that you might one day bring other people onto your company, it is probably a good idea to start using this model today.\n\nSometimes aspiring entrepreneurs keep their startup idea a secret. They think their idea will make them millions, so they don\u2019t want their idea stolen, along with their millions!\n\nA common phrase that went around my coworking space said the opposite:\n\nIf your idea fails, it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t share it with enough people.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be scared to share your idea, because the idea is the easy part. The hard part is the sheer mass of time, commitment, skills, and suffering it takes to turn \u201ca good idea\u201d into \u201ca legal company selling a functional product.\u201d\n\nJust because you share an idea with others, doesn\u2019t mean they will execute it; and since great execution of an idea requires a total restructuring of your life and priorities, it is highly unlikely that the other person will drop everything else going on in their life in order to execute your idea.\n\nSharing your idea is a great way to get early market feedback since you can see how other people react.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the source, but Derek Sivers once said that you don\u2019t want to invest in the idea that makes people go, \u201cOh, that sounds cool!\u201d You want the reaction, \u201cOh my God, I need that! That would make my life so much easier!\u201d This reaction hints that your product could provide actual value to the user.\n\nA warning about this: These reactions can help you in the early conceptual days of the startup, but by the time you are actually developing the product, you must trust people at their wallet and not at their word. Just because people express interest and say they will buy your product, does not mean they actually will. Referring back to Lesson #6, this is why you build an MVP\u2014because you need actual market feedback ASAP!\n\nThis last advice doesn\u2019t come from me, but from an attorney I met with prior to starting Immersion Arcade. He said, \u201cIf you are starting your own business and you really want to do it right, you need to hire an accountant and an attorney as soon as possible. I know they are expensive, but the sooner you bring them in, the better off you will be in the long run.\"\n\nI posted a thread to /r/Entrepreneur asking for feedback on this advice. I encourage you to read the responses yourself, but the general consensus seems to be it is smart to hire an accountant sooner-than-later, while a lawyer may not be necessary until later (depending on the business).\n\nI also posted this to my personal Facebook page. Here are some responses:"

        "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t Rationalize Away Your Doubts\u201d 5 Startup Strategies With Mariko Tokioka, Founder/CEO of EastMeetEast\n\nThank you so much for doing this with us! What is your \u201cbackstory\u201d?\n\nWhile I was running Quipper, I was single and was busy with startup management life. I tried major online dating sites such as Match.com and eHarmony. It was really hard for me to find my ideal Japanese guy, one who could understand my culture and speak with my parents in my language, as those major sites group all \u201cAsians\u201d in one category. I began to think about the growing dating industry and more segmented ones such as JDate.com. Why not create one for Asians that can cater to the detailed needs of Asian cultural matching? I wanted to help other Asians who were having a difficult time searching for a relationship like me. That\u2019s how I started EastMeetEast, the largest Asian dating site in North America.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that happened to you since you began leading your company?3.\n\nEastMeetEast is an online dating site, and it was very difficult to acquire seed users from scratch. Trust is very important in online dating, and no one feels safe with a brand they never heard of. Additionally, the Asian community is tight-knit in the US and reputation is very important, but we had zero credibility in the beginning. All of the founding members including myself decided to walk around K-town and parks in December in NYC, to distribute cards and ask people to sign up in person. The weather was insanely cold and dark. I always started the conversation with \u201cHi, are you single?\u201d to avoid talking further with someone in a couple or married, but often, guys thought I was just trying my best to get their numbers. Some would say \u201cNo, I have a girlfriend!\u201d We acquired our first 1,000 users on foot. Now, thanks to our marketing team, we acquire users through scalable digital channels such as Asian American video content marketing \u2014 this has yielded 22M views in total to date.\n\nWhat do you think makes your company stand out? Can you share a story?\n\nWe stand for Asians and build community for Asians! Asians are often under-represented, and their voice is not heard. Only 3\u20134% of Hollywood characters are Asians, and we want to make a change.\n\nWe\u2019ve built an enormous community of Asian singles in North America. One way we\u2019ve been able to do this is our strategic collaborations with countless Asian American influencers including Timothy DelaGhetto, FungBros, and Joanna Sotomura. EastMeetEast resonated with their fans and they could connect and match on the site.\n\nI\u2019ve worked a long time developing an Asian cultural matching algorithm. For example, our algorithm would look at the age a user arrived in the US. If you were second or third generation, you might prefer to date an Asian American compared to someone who recently arrived. Food and religious similarities plays a huge part in matching as well, as they\u2019re both huge factors in finding that perfect match. Once a week we send out one-to-one matches using our cultural matching algorithm to users, and we always see a huge bump in activity that day.\n\nAre you working on any new or exciting projects now?\n\nWe\u2019re using our Series A funds on 2 projects \u2014 first, we\u2019ve partnered with AI lab Digital Garage to build Love.AI. DG is one of our Series A investors. The system will take EME users\u2019 profiles, it\u2019s impression, and communication data into the algorithm and recommend the best matches. No company has ever cracked the matching algorithm fully in the dating industry. You hear about the use of AI in dating such as fraud detection, but an AI matching algorithm is still a big challenge, and we are going to be the first one to innovate. We can\u2019t say too much about the details yet, but the users should be able to find the right match much more quickly without taking the effort of scrolling down too much or sending tons of messages. The second project is West East Dating (WED), an inclusive dating site for Asians and Westerners alike in Southeast Asia. West East Dating\u2019s mission is to help Asians find their lifetime partner. WED will serve as a platform where like-minded individuals will connect and come together, in celebration of Asian culture, language, and heritage. The first test market is selected as the Philippines.\n\nWhat advice would you give to other CEOs or founders to help their employees to thrive?\n\nThe time that my team members grew tremendously is when they were given responsibility and ownership. When you\u2019re given more responsibility, you first struggle, face your fear of failure, then eventually start seeing things from a different perspective and come up with your own style of solving the issue to finally make it there.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are?\n\nMy co-founder, Kenji-travis, has contributed to EastMeetEast\u2019s success tremendously.\n\nHow have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?\n\nWe have over 30,000 happy couples in exclusive relationships. Every month, we receive more and more \u201cthank you\u201d emails from our users after their weddings! EastMeetEast is changing lives, and we want to continue making an impact by helping Asians find their life partners on a much bigger scale.\n\nWhat are your \u201c5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Became CEO\u201d and why. (Please share a story or example for each.)\n\nWhen you are building a business that is not validated yet or no such market yet exists, you have to be persistent and strong-headed to make all your stakeholders believe in your direction. The danger here is when a founder is focused so much on execution, they may start rationalizing their direction to their team and investors, despite possible risks. The end result will lead to running out of money without making a disruptive growth. In my case, I had new business that was going so-so. I could see this business was growing, however, I also saw limitations and issues with profitability and scaling it further. I rationalized my idea and shared the mediocre growth with my team. After discussing the issues further with my mentor, I saw the roadblock of rationalization. I quickly came up with several changes that could be made which led to a big growth in the business.\n\nWhen I was initially fundraising, I was focused on the cost, revenue, and profit model, and I used a lot of diagrams. The business stage was so early, and I got rejected many times. At some point, a VC friend told me that he felt like he was hearing a corporate presentation from me, and there was no soul to it. So I changed my style to telling a story, explaining why I am doing what I\u2019m doing and the problem I am solving. I could see immediately see that my audience was getting more engaged emotionally. Startups are tough. You have to retain the best employees with very few resources. You have to maintain relationships with investors even without a developed path to profitability. Strong, continuous storytelling of your vision is the only thing that gives a sense of purpose to unite all stakeholders.\n\nEastMeetEast had a remote work structure when founded, and I had underestimated the power of working closely together.\n\nEach one of us working was in different time zone, so work would be on hold depending on where in the world you were. It was also much harder to create a sense of \u201cteam\u201d when people were remote. When the opportunity came to open our main offices in NYC, we jumped at the change. After joining together in an office environment, our productivity increased dramatically. Our team is stronger than ever communicating face to face, bonding like a family, and respecting each other\u2019s professionalism.\n\nStartup life can be more chaotic than you ever thought possible. I almost lost my mind when I found a surprise bill that I could never afford. My frustration and anger came to a head when my sole business partner started to move in a different direction. I was a hard person to be around.\n\nThankfully, so many friends and colleagues helped me throughout my journey. When I only had business idea and nothing to give, one later-stage entrepreneur helped me by introducing me to valuable investors and founders. My investor surprised me with special gifts and kind words for my wedding. Through these people, I\u2019ve learned the importance of LQ (the IQ of Love). No matter what happens, make sure you maintain the habit of giving love. People may not appreciate your love immediately, but it will come back to you over the course of your career. I\u2019ve found that having gratitude makes life much more rewarding and meaningful.\n\nMy great founder friend who has a VC-backed middle-stage business, told me that he always communicates \u201ccompany values\u201d with his team, so I decided to follow this idea with my own team. When you have more than a handful of employees and indirect reports, communicating your company values will definitely help the team believe and perform together for the greater good.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201cLife Lesson Quote\u201d?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.\u201d \u2014 C. S. Lewis\n\nSome of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this :-)\u00b7\n\nIn my entrepreneurial life, I\u2019ve always learned tons from fellow founders. I would love to meet Jack Ma from Alibaba. I love the story of how Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, decided to invest $20M in Jack Ma when he wasn\u2019t well known yet. Son said Jack Ma had no business plan and zero revenue at the time, however, his eyes were shining. The way he talked and showed charisma, led the young people to follow him. I\u2019d love to learn this kind of attitude and leadership from him."

        "title": "Create a Training Program: 5 Steps to Building a More Competitive Workforce",
        "text": "Companies who are able to create a world-class training program and deliver it efficiently can keep their staff up to date and informed \u2014 with all the affordability and convenience of doing it in-house. Whether you want to expand your employees\u2019 knowledge of new products or keep them abreast of the latest customer service trends, offering accessible training will help set your company apart.\n\nBut effective training requires more than just information. To create a training program that trains, be strategic in your approach. Pause to first understand factors such as your audience, the company\u2019s overall objectives, and useful metrics \u2014 then, map the training program out accordingly.\n\nTo ensure your employees get the most out of your training programs, follow these five steps:\n\nBefore getting to the nitty-gritty of content development, take time to define the parameters that will act as the foundation of your program \u2014 defining learner personas, goals, and success metrics.\n\nFirst, define personas of your intended audience. Identify their demographics \u2014 for example, their age, location, gender or family structure. Are they primarily millennials? Middle-aged? A mix? How about their financial status and education history?\n\nCreating detailed personas of your archetypical learner will help you create more efficient and engaging training modules. For example, if you discover that your average learner works over 40 hours per week, you may create a training program that accounts for their busy schedule and lack of learning time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have this information, research your target learner audience via interviews with a sampling of potential users and supervisors.\n\nAfter defining your learner personas, focus on establishing your business or department goals. Are you going to create a training program to onboard new on-demand workers? Or perhaps you\u2019ve identified a need to reduce churn and boost retention. Whatever your goals, let them guide your training strategy from the onset.\n\nFinally, define how you will measure success. To do this, break \u201csuccess\u201d into three components: engagement, learner knowledge, and business goals.\n\nTo measure engagement, use metrics provided by your training platform. For example, if you use Wistia to host your training videos, you can view metrics such as page views, clicks, and learner progress.\n\nTo measure learner knowledge, create and deliver relevant quizzes, assessments, assignments, and surveys to determine engagement and knowledge retention. And to measure the impact of training on your business goals, establish a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), then study them before and after training implementation. For example, have sales significantly increased after training? Has there been a meaningful boost in productivity?\n\nAfter you have defined your learner personas, goals and success metrics, it\u2019s time to lay out your content development approach and organizational structure of your program.\n\nBegin writing your outline by focusing on the topics you want the program to cover. To choose your topics, ask yourself: what information is most important to my learners? What do they need to learn to meet the training goals and objectives?\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re creating a training program about how to handle demanding customers, your learners will need to understand where customer hostility stems from and how to diminish it. Therefore, a good topic might be \u2018How to deal with upset customers\u2019.\n\nRepeat this step until you\u2019ve created a solid topical outline, one in which each topic is a stepping stone toward the ultimate goal or goals of the program. Then, determine how you are going to present each topic, keeping in mind that video, audio and multimedia slideshows can transform even the most mundane information into engaging content.\n\nThanks to your outline, your objectives have been fleshed out with topics, and you\u2019ve matched your topics with their media counterpart. So let\u2019s start building your training program.\n\nTo develop quality audio content, consider using a program like Audacity to record and edit. It\u2019s free and user-friendly. A good microphone wouldn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nFor video, a basic video editor will probably fulfill most of your needs, and the YouTube Editor is a surprisingly good choice for simple editing tasks.\n\nFor image editing, Photoshop-phobics should give something like Canva a shot, which offers an extensive stock photo library, as well as easy-to-use filters, fonts, and layouts.\n\nTo bring all of these creations together, presentation software like Google Slides or Haiku Deck provide an intuitive platform. And for a more advanced instructional platform, there are programs like Adobe Captivate or VoiceThread.\n\nRelated reading: How to Create an Online Course in 5 Easy Steps\n\nAfter you\u2019ve followed those initial steps to create a training program that comprises such valuable, targeted content, it\u2019s essential to optimize that program\u2019s delivery. You want your learners to be engaged in the material and able to comprehend each piece of content. They should feel supported by the program instructor and confident in themselves.\n\nBreaking up your content into chunks is a great way to avoid confusing or overwhelming your audience, as is mixing up the media and presentation strategy. Inject compelling images into long sections of text, and use casual, more conversational rhetoric with your learners, rather than a lecturing tone.\n\nAnother strategy to keep your learners continuously engaged is to incentivize the program. Yes, the learning objectives are probably an incentive in their own right, but adding bonus incentives will only increase engagement and enthusiasm. So, consider offering prizes such as product discounts, extra time off, or fun swag to those who, say, score a certain percentage on a test. These incentives don\u2019t have to break the bank \u2014 they just need to appeal to your audience and show that you, and their company, recognize and appreciate their achievements.\n\nAside from incentives, maintain high levels of engagement by purposefully communicating with your learners. Email your learners regularly to help them stay motivated, remind them about upcoming assignments or tests and check in on individual learners if you notice they are struggling.\n\nFacilitate high-quality conversations by including discussion prompts throughout the course, or foster a learner community via a forum on your platform. Keep people talking, asking questions and interacting with each other. And don\u2019t forget to participate in these discussions yourself. Timely feedback and active participation show learners you care about their success.\n\nMeasuring your training program\u2019s success will not only better prepare you for the next time you create a training program \u2014 it will also allow you to use your findings to improve your current program in real time. Once your program is in full swing, start monitoring engagement and training effectiveness through your training platform\u2019s analytics and reporting feature. Then, translate those insights into actionable improvements you can make to your program.\n\nAdditionally, learner feedback can provide more profound insights into what is working and what isn\u2019t. Ask your students for feedback via surveys or questionnaires. Talk to individual students directly about how they are receiving the program. You may just find that the ones taking your program are the ones who best understand how to improve it.\n\nThroughout the five steps of the 5 Steps to Building Stronger Employees, we consistently emphasized the importance of launching with less and taking an iterative approach to your training program. This logic is rooted in the idea that every training program should be highly tailored and targeted at specific learner personas.\n\nAt Northpass, we work with a diverse portfolio of companies, from non-profits to top SaaS platforms, each with their unique business model and training use case. For those who are just starting with online training, the most efficient way to develop great content is to look at the behavior and feedback of the learners who receive it. To do that, you must launch, to some extent, a training program.\n\nThe program may not be perfect. The design may not be entirely polished. The catalog may not even contain more than one course. However, launching a minimum viable product (MVP) will offer you profoundly meaningful insight into the quantitative and qualitative data needed to make your training program great.\n\nAs you work through this process, use the success metrics outlined in this guide to help you show ROI and identify critical areas that can be improved. You will find that the guide is meant to function more like a cycle, requiring you to continually revisit your goals, update and build new content and listen to your learners.\n\nWorking through this guide may have been the beginning of your journey to create an online training program, but for successful programs, there is no end. There is only more learning to be done, more improvements to be made and more significant impact to be had.\n\nThis is just a sample of our framework.

        "title": "6 Insightful Learnings from Bootstrapping a Marketplace Platform for Creators",
        "text": "Over the last year, I\u2019ve been hard at work trying to build a business. Coming from the marketing world, I had a pretty unique point of view.\n\nI was entering my sixth year of employment at a fast-rising digital marketing agency when a single, timely piece of content, posted to YouTube by my now former boss (who I\u2019m sure many of you know), quite literally changed the course of my life forever.\n\nFrom that day forward, I didn\u2019t quite know what I wanted to build, but I knew that I wanted to start documenting the process of whatever it may be.\n\nThat\u2019s when I started writing The Ascent, a solo-venture blog turned top-100 publication right here on Medium. I started experimenting with semi-regular vlogging as well.\n\nFast-forward to the following April and by the time I was ready to leave the company \u2014 and my life in New York \u2014 behind, the only real direction I had in terms of a potential business was that I wanted to harness my skills and do something I truly enjoyed.\n\nSo, naturally, I turned my sights to personal branding.\n\nActually, it\u2019s one of the hardest things about entrepreneurship altogether.\n\nI\u2019m a big advocate for just getting out there and tasting things, even though I used to be quite the planner.\n\nWhen I first set out on this course, my girlfriend/business partner at the time and I committed to doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d while we figured things out.\n\nBut, as it turns out, deciding what to build in the first place is one of the hardest things.\n\nCould we potentially build a premium offering on top of all the free content and inspiration currently being delivered there? Could we offer personal branding consulting packages for not just this community, but everyone else out there in need of marketing their business or building their brand?\n\nThat seed of an idea first popped up and we really ran with it. We started building out our website, creating different branding packages, and marketing our services on sites like LinkedIn.\n\nThen, we started getting our first clients. Within a few weeks, we had 5.\n\nAnd then, a couple months later, we realized exactly what we were doing. We were very much creating the same type of agency and business we had just left behind\u2026 and we weren\u2019t happy at all, which was the biggest thing.\n\nSo, we pulled the plug, before it ever really had the chance to take off.\n\nCould we have made a fair amount of money in this business? Yes, definitely. Could we have been happy eventually, once we scaled? Sure, I bet we could.\n\nDid we look at it as a failure? No. If anything, we were pretty optimistic about the move. It showed how much we had grown in that time.\n\nLike Thomas Edison, we didn\u2019t fail, we just found one way that wouldn\u2019t work for us in terms of building a personal branding business.\n\nThe decision to move forward with the business in the first place, however, drastically accelerated the learning curve for me. I quickly learned that even though I had real knowledge and even expertise in terms of growing an agency, that the consulting and client-services route just wasn\u2019t for me.\n\nSo, I quickly turned my sights on something in which I didn\u2019t have all that much experience: the product-services industry.\n\nAlthough scary at first, this idea felt much more my speed.\n\nIn this case, MVP means Minimum Viable Platform, not Product\u2026\n\nOnce I started thinking about my business in a more product-driven way, the idea of creating a marketplace platform became really intriguing to me.\n\nSo, I started doing a fair amount of research, during which I uncovered a number of different resources. As it turned out, none would prove more valuable than Sharetribe.\n\nOne valuable piece of information I was able to extract from the many articles I read there was the following:\n\nThat sentence, along with a short case study about how Airbnb first started as a simple Wordpress blog (both of which you can find here), were all I needed as far as permission from myself in order to start building out this idea.\n\nGoing into this, I knew that getting something to market quickly was imperative, but that didn\u2019t mean it necessarily had to be riddled with cool features or contain everything I\u2019d ever hoped it would contain.\n\nNo, in order to be a true MVP, it just needed to be something that worked.\n\nTo borrow an image from the Sharetribe blog post I linked above, this is how it should work:\n\nBefore I knew it, JRNY (pronounced \u201cjourney\u201d) was born.\n\nWhich comes first: aspiring personal brand builders or photo/video talent?\n\nAnother big learning that came out of this new direction of ours was this idea of solving for \u2018chicken vs. egg\u2019 types of problems.\n\nAll of the research I have done to date around this nightmare scenario has indicated that, as a marketplace founder, I should first be focusing on building out the supply side of my platform. For me, that means service providers.\n\nBy now, I had landed firmly on (and committed to) my new business idea:\n\nNot only did it still align perfectly with my marketing expertise, but it was something I desperately needed as well: cheaper access to high-quality photo & video content for my brand.\n\nFirst, I needed a strategy for building out the supply. My platform would need to solve some real problems for professional photographers & videographers.\n\nThen and only then would I be able to leverage all of the various marketing and PR tactics I\u2019ve garnered over the years (my real strength) to promote this thing in a way that would help it gain real traction and customers.\n\nThis also happens to be the stage I\u2019m currently in with this venture.\n\nWant to save yourself a future headache or two? Launch early and launch often.\n\nThe idea of launching something even before I, myself feel ready is a truly frightening thought. However, in terms of making this thing a success, I\u2019ve allowed myself to buy into the idea of it being necessary.\n\nI\u2019ve chosen to adopt an agile approach to this platform, which I think coincides well with the learnings I\u2019ve mentioned above.\n\nTo me, solving my chicken vs. egg problem and starting with building out the supply means having to unveil what\u2019s behind the curtain rather immediately.\n\nTo borrow yet another image from the Sharetribe article I referenced above:\n\nBefore you let anyone in the door, you need to be willing to build relationships.\n\nIn knowing that I first need to build out JRNY\u2019s supply of service providers, the marketer in me just wants me to blast out my product page to the entire world, welcoming any and all oncoming interest.\n\nBut that\u2019s just not a viable way to approach this thing, at least not currently.\n\nThe next big learning I\u2019ve gained from creating JRNY has been in the way of being relatively selective with who I let in to start.\n\nIt is my firm belief, watching guys like Gary V. and Casey Neistat over the last several years, that there is a real market opportunity today for the hungry, young hustlers out there who:\n\nSo, while I clearly see the product/market fit for JRNY in terms of its potential upside, now I\u2019m focusing my efforts on attracting the very first suppliers.\n\nRight now, that means connecting with the professionals who live in our first two launch cities (New York & LA) and are already managing photo/video business of some kind.\n\nIn my mind, if we can help provide a better alternative or solution for these individuals, everybody else will also have those needs. Furthermore, if the very first suppliers we can get signed up on our platform produce high-quality work, it will only serve to help grow JRNY in its early days via word-of-mouth.\n\nI began my targeted outreach just this past week, starting with Instagram. It has been highly productive in the way of sparking those initial conversations I need to make in order for JRNY to be successful.\n\nI also happened to learn some valuable Instagram outreach tips along the way, which you can see here:\n\nIt\u2019s true, no one will ever care as much about your product as you do, right now.\n\nI\u2019m extremely happy with where I\u2019m at heading into year two of this business journey.\n\nEverything I\u2019ve read about entrepreneurship \u2014 the hard work, the fear of failure, the lack of sleep, the caffeine, the lifestyle, the newfound freedom, the responsibilities \u2014 is true, to some degree, but even knowing the potential downsides, I still wouldn\u2019t trade this experience for anything.\n\nPerhaps the biggest insight I\u2019ve gained from this whole process to date has been that of recognizing the importance of doing what makes me happy.\n\nAt the end of the day, I went into entrepreneurship to build something for myself, as much as others.\n\nI care deeply about personal branding. I also care about technology, and product building, and marketing, and social media.\n\nAs I mentioned in the very beginning of this piece, \u201cthe only real direction I had in terms of a potential business was that I wanted to harness my skills and do something I truly enjoyed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what gets me excited to wake up and \u2018go to work\u2019 every morning. It\u2019s what keeps me so emotionally attached to my vision.\n\nAnd, if I\u2019m not too careful, it just might be what leads me to success."

        "text": "Envy is a question of attitude. By reacting with envy, we stop learning from those who know or understand more than we do, and so we chase ourselves to inaction. But by reacting with emulation, we can ask to be taught through learning and put on our effort to match or surpass someone. Emulation enables us to grow and to acquire the advantages that would otherwise have provoked our envy.\n\nAlso, we envy because we are blind to the bigger picture. For example, when we envy our neighbour for his shiny convertible car, we mostly ignore all the efforts and sacrifices that have gone into affording it, to say nothing of the many risks and inconveniences of driving such a car.\n\nIn life, we are rich not only by what we have, but also and mostly by what we do not. It is all too easy to forget that success has its price as well. For example, the investment banker has maybe effectively sold his soul for his \u2018success\u2019, which left him with so little spirit that he no longer has the vital capacity to enjoy the advantages that he has acquired. A person like this is not to be envied but rather pitied. To have more control on envy, it\u2019s necessary to keep on reframing, and reframing requires perspective."

        "title": "The Art of Communication in Tech \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Communication\u2026the ever-evolving art of effectively delivering a message to one\u2019s audience. With that surface-level definition, communication would seem to be nothing more than a basic expression of one\u2019s thoughts, whether it be in oral or written form. Simple enough, right? Yet so many people fail at it, and arguably the worst failures in connecting the message with the audience occur in the tech industry.\n\nIt is certainly understandable why this is the case. One only needs to look as far as the recent grilling of Mark Zuckerberg by Congress to realize how much is not understood about the internet, how internet and tech companies operate and make revenue, and how activity is tracked when the services are not directly in use. People think cookies are the thing that the furry blue creature on Sesame Street eats, that you send emails about Black Panther through What\u2019s App that are magically decrypted to serve ads, and that services are magically free and making money off of some money tree. Quite likely is the case that this ignorance may actually be purposely seeded by major tech players who require data and analytics to drive their core business model, wherein they likely use purposely complicated verbiage and jargon to instil a feeling that the internet and tech simply cannot be understood by those not gifted in the art of computer science. Similar to a vehicle manufacturer that often makes things as simple as an oil change seem complicated in order to push people to their local dealership service department, so too do tech companies overcomplicate topics that should not be overcomplicated in order to prevent the anxiety of people who are using their services. It\u2019s the classic \u201cthis is too complicated so just trust us, you\u2019re safe\u201d approach, and it\u2019s worked all too well.\n\nWhile this communication strategy works for limited cases where willful ignorance assists the core business model, for many tech companies ignorance means lack of adoption. This means death for most companies. Sound grim? Good, it should. In the Facebook case, the data usage appears etherial to most people \u2014 they use the service which at its surface is very simple, and they get presented with ads. No real thought goes into what happens in the black box between user and ad. But if you take a company like Apple, where there are many complicated moving parts to their products, tying together user experience and technicalities can be hugely complicated.\n\nHow does Apple sell people on using their products? Simplicity and humanity. They market their products not on their technical specifications like the number of cores or the megapixels on the camera, but rather on how the product would fit into your daily life and how it looks and feels. They don\u2019t sell you on their product, but instead on the lifestyle that their products enable.\n\nOur own company has been going through this for ourselves. We have something people have identified as a need. Yet, when we were pitching it to people, they weren\u2019t connecting with it. Sometimes there was a confused response (you know, the one with the glazed, absent look in their eyes where they\u2019re basically begging for mercy), other times it was a simple \u201cthat sounds cool\u201d with a quick nod. We had a clear pain point, but we were trying to sell people on the technology rather than the lifestyle\u2026and technology is not easily digestible. We regrouped, tore apart our messaging, and examined why were doing what we were doing \u2014 we wanted to make people\u2019s lives seamless and simple, removing all of the menial tasks that take people away doing what is important to them, from family and social time, to hobbies, to work. This drove us to move our core slogan from \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Smart Home OS\u201d to \u201cJust Live.\u201d This will obviously continue to evolve, but already there\u2019s been a huge difference on how excited people get with this new messaging. People see what the system provides, rather than what it is.\n\nTechnical people are notorious for barraging people with deep technical details that they never asked for. This mindset rears its ugly head with the user interfaces and experiences that are present in software that was not informed by general users \u2014 too many features that are immediately presented, making navigation impossibly difficult for the average user and leading many people to either accidentally break the software or cease use all together out of frustration. A properly designed piece of software puts the less frequently used features inside of well-formed menus or secondary navigation endpoints, making it accessible for those who are power users, but removing the clutter for the average user.\n\nIf you are technical person or a tech company, you need to bring these user interface and user experience design concepts into your core communication strategy. Minimizing your talking, communicating in a way that is responsive to your audience and their technical expertise level, and letting your audience guide your depth of conversation will yield great results. This is not to say that you should not communicate what you are doing, but you should be doing so in the fewest words possible without being excessively logos-driven. Remove unnecessary details, focussing instead on how you are removing complication and pain for them. The irony is that often technical people, while trying to explain with a high level of technicality to people how their solution solves their pain, end up actually putting their audience through pain because they simply don\u2019t want to hear how the entire system works. If the audience wants to know those technical details, they will ask for them. For everyone else, focus on triggering the imagination of people so that they can create their own view of how your product or solution will work for them. Let them sell themselves on your product, with you just facilitating the exercise. This means moving away from a purely logos-driven (logical) communication approach, and rather using pathos (emotions) and ethos (credibility) to better round out the communication.\n\nImagine being stuck in a room with someone who rants for hours on end about how amazing the Intel Core series processors are because of their architecture, how many gigaflops an NVIDIA graphics processor can do, front side bus speeds, DDR3 versus LPDDR3 RAM, and so on and so forth, and you cannot escape them. This is how you sound if you talk about your product in overly technical terms without being prompted for that information. Don\u2019t be that person. Just. Don\u2019t.\n\nRadically overhauling one\u2019s communication sounds taxing, does it not? So why would you even do it? Well, great question dear reader!\n\nFirst off, people tend to like making money (or at least enough to survive\u2026that\u2019s sort of important). It\u2019s much harder to make money if you aren\u2019t selling product. This communication strategy is almost guaranteed to drive up sales and build brand loyalty. Money == Good. Communication Revamp == Money. Therefore, Communication Revamp == Good.\n\nSecondly, you want loyalty from not only your users, but also loyalty from your employees. You want them to wake up every morning feeling empowered by what they\u2019re working on. Technical details will get them interested, but vision and purpose will make them passionate. It\u2019s that passion that you want to create because you will get better quality work and less attrition, which is better for everyone. Communication is what does that.\n\nThirdly, it\u2019s an ethical thing. A poor communication strategy from some major tech players has now proven that purposely seeded ignorance can cause everything from distrust in technology to identity theft to the slow destruction of democracy and the modern world as we know \u2014 all because people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Do you want to be the one who causes the fall of society? Yeah, I didn\u2019t think so (I really hope you answered no to that).\n\nWe need to change, as an industry, how we communicate. This might start with communication training for all technical people, but something needs to change. We owe it to the world to prevent distrust in and fear of technology due to either poor or unethical communication use. It all starts with a little thought and caring about other people."

        "text": "I quit after four months. At the time I blamed it on the founder. And the culture. But it was on me. I gave up all my stock options.\n\nThe company sold for between $16\u201325 million from reports I have seen.\n\nI\u2019m not mad about it. Because what I found out was that my personality isn\u2019t a match for uncertainty. Unless it\u2019s my own business. And much of the beginning of a startup is rife with uncertainty. I was naive.\n\nI am not patient. I want things to work now. Right now.\n\nI wanted the cool office space. With a ping pong table. Before we were even funded. I was stupid. And impatient.\n\nSo we worked out of co-working space in New York City. It was actually pretty nice. Nothing to complain about. But it bothered me. Because I was way ahead of myself.\n\nEven in my ideas. I didn\u2019t understand that the development team couldn\u2019t just build an app right now. They had to finish the core site work first.\n\nPatience is most notably a virtue. But it is mandatory for surviving in the infancy of a startup, if not the whole way.\n\nSometimes your paycheck is late. Sometimes you work next to people you don\u2019t know, from another company. Sometimes you need to just do what they are paying you to do and not try to do more.\n\nI couldn\u2019t do that. And that\u2019s on me. I was given a pretty awesome opportunity, but I couldn\u2019t wait for it to develop. I made some game changing decisions that I believe fueled the company\u2019s success after I left. But I wasn\u2019t there to see it. Because I quit. Because I couldn\u2019t wait. I wasn\u2019t patient.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve been watching the 76ers too much. Or reading Joel Embiid\u2019s Twitter feed all day. But still. There is a process to everything. And even though I was the Director of Business Development, I was still new. And I wasn\u2019t going to get all the information from the founder on day one.\n\nMy initial job was to find interns who were overqualified, but eager to help. I did this. And one went on to do great things for the company. And now for herself. But I was always questioning the founder\u2019s methods. And the process. I didn\u2019t trust the process.\n\nMaybe I didn\u2019t trust myself. Because I was uncomfortable with the startup environment. Maybe I didn\u2019t trust the founder. Maybe I had reasons for that. But the process wasn\u2019t mine to adjust at that point. I needed to do what was asked of me to get the ball rolling.\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust the founder or the process, don\u2019t take the job. Because you will end up second guessing everything. Without the power, in the beginning, to effectuate the change you want to. Because it\u2019s not your company.\n\nI have to admit it. I was pretty high on myself. I changed the direction of the company to something hipper and more accessible. But I was letting my ego play way too big a role in what I was doing.\n\nI hadn\u2019t already founded and sold a startup. I just closed my failing New York City gallery. Who the f*ck was I to have a startup ego? Nobody.\n\nMany startups blow up over ego. Many businesses blow up over ago. Many relationships blow up over ego. Ego is the grim reaper of all things good. It can drive massive success. But at a cost.\n\nIf you get in at the bottom floor of a startup and you aren\u2019t the founder, you need to check your ego at the door. Because you are replaceable. We all are. I was. Even though I thought I wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt turns out that the original product was a main component of their eventual sale. My ego told me I knew what was going to be good for the company. But I wasn\u2019t thinking like a founder. With a plan to get out at a certain valuation. I didn\u2019t get it. Because my ego was in the way.\n\nI went from six figures to less than half of that in my next job. Because I went back into the art world. And just did what people used to do for me at my gallery.\n\nOne second I was shaping the future of art fairs via technology. The next second I was taking inventory of Warhols. I mean, it could have been worse. But it happened because I couldn\u2019t resist premature evacuation.\n\nI was weak. And I paid for it.\n\nAs I was preparing to write this article I did some research on the sale. And it appears there are some issues now. Maybe I did know something after all.\n\nBut I quit after four months. I certainly could have objected later. With my stock options in my pocket."

This is a terrible photo, I further pursued a few questions through email and hopped in the car in the rain and got down there quickly. People hate moving anywhere in the rain so this is an optimal condition to get ahead of any competition. Shooting Alberto a text I assured him I was on my way and would be there in 40 minutes. Remember, the sooner you can get off your ass and move on something you see \u2014 you\u2019ve upped the probability that you are the one who wins the goal.\n\nPhenomenal, the table and top don\u2019t fit in my Jeep Laredo. After doing our best jigsaw puzzle dance to get it into the trunk I decided the table base (which had a very sturdy metal frame) had to go upside down tied off onto my roof rack. I secured every corner angle with the rope so it could not slide side to side or forwards and backwards if we were to stop short. You should always keep one of these polyester rope cords in the car, Thanks Lex this rope you gave me certainly paid off.\n\nAfter cleaning the background and sweeping the floor, I\u2019ve shot a few new sleek photos of the table so it could be envisioned as someones own. I\u2019ve posted this to the local Westchester community sale page, as well as craigslist, and the normal FB Marketplace. The white carpet really helps the item pop. We\u2019ll let this marinate and see if we have any bites.\n\nThis was a rather quick sale for each of these tables. Quality always sells. David sent me a message earlier in the evening letting me know he worked in the area and he\u2019d like to see the table. I did what anyone trying to reach a $1,000 goal did, I obliged.\n\nAfter seeing how I disassembled the table and seeing the strength and quality I helped him load it into his Ford Explorer to be taken back to the city as a new work space. He was lost as to why I was selling it. Honestly, I really liked this table and wanted to keep it. However \u2014 we\u2019ve got goals to meet. I accidentally left one of the pieces on my kitchen table\u2026. Instantly giving David a call to see if he was on the highway yet I jumped in the car and met him with a crucial piece of the table!"

        "title": "Why You Make Terrible Life Decisions \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "In David McRaney\u2019s You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You\u2019re Deluding Yourself, he highlights the Wason Selection Task, an experiment conducted by psychologist Peter Wason in 1977. He presented a game of logic that should be a cinch to figure out, but less than 10 percent of participants got the correct answer. Let\u2019s see how you\u2019d do:\n\nFour cards are dealt in front of you and flipped over, you see from left to right a three, an eight, a red card and a brown card. You are told that these cards have single numbers on one side and single colors on the other. Then you are told that if a card is even on one side, then it must be red on the opposite side. Which cards are necessary to flip over to prove that this rule is true?\n\nWhen I first read this I automatically thought, \u201cthe eight and red card, because if the eight has red on the other side and the red has an even number on the other side then the statement was true.\u201d Well, then I realized that I was a part of the 90% that failed to select the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is that you must flip over both the eight card and the brown card. Flipping over the red card is pointless because if there was an odd number on the other side it proves nothing, it does not violate the rule. If the other side of the eight card is red, you\u2019ve confirmed the rule, but have not proven if the rule is broken. By flipping over the brown card, if it\u2019s odd you\u2019ve confirmed the rule, but if it\u2019s even you have falsified the claims of the rule.\n\nJust like that I fell victim to confirmation bias- the tendency to search for, interpret, favor and recall information in a way that confirms one\u2019s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. When I personally completed the Wason Selection Task I was on a mission to prove the rule true and I was content with seeing red on one side and even on the other, but it wasn\u2019t even a second thought to prove the rule I was told to be incorrect. I did not make the attempt to disprove the rule, why is that? Well, because we all have the tendency and the desire to prove things we believe to be true.\n\nConfirmation bias can lead you to make terrible decisions because you are making decisions that confirm what you believe to be correct. This means that you look for instances that confirm your insecurities or beliefs and ignore other instances that don\u2019t prove your insecurities or beliefs. Essentially, every single day you are making decisions based on information you concocted in your head.\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt like EVERYONE was looking at you? You were walking to the bar and wiped out as if someone had just laid down a fresh coat of Crisco on the floor. You get up in horror that everyone saw you fall, but in reality, you failed to realize the other 95 people in the room that don\u2019t even know you exist.\n\nConfirmation bias affects how you look at the world, how you interpret information and how you remember things. Have you ever had an argument with a friend or loved one over the details from a past story? Yes, even your memory is affected by confirmation bias.\n\nEveryone falls victim to this, we seek information that confirms what we believe, because being wrong sucks. No one wants to be wrong. Your beliefs are a core part of your identity and it\u2019s hard to admit that they may not be correct. Disproving these beliefs often leads to cognitive dissonance, which is a feeling of immense stress and anxiety. When this happens, it triggers a fight or flight response. Are you the type that will fight to prove your belief to be true or distance yourself from the new information (flight)?\n\nWant to combat confirmation bias, not make terrible, irrational decisions, and reduce the stress that it can cause? Great!\n\nDon\u2019t blow off people that provide opposing information to your belief. Learn to seek understanding of where the other person is coming form or be open to their information source. Seek to understand and get comfortable with people playing devil\u2019s advocate.\n\nView the world from the eyes of a child and get curious. Live with curiosity and not conviction that you know what is right. When you loosen up your grip on having to be right you can experience life with curiosity and wonder. Be willing to be wrong every now and then and you\u2019ll be amazed at the insights you\u2019ll gain.\n\nTake time to think about the thoughts in your head. When you hear something, do you have an immediate reaction to it? Why is that? Next time you\u2019re hearing or reading something that confirms your beliefs, pull back and actually look for ways to prove yourself wrong.\n\nNo matter what you believe, you will always be able to find someone or something to confirm those beliefs. It is up to you to not only seek truth, but to also seek information that contradicts your beliefs.\n\nA great way to manage the stress and anxiety in your life is to practice not feeling attacked, wrong, or belittled when someone challenges your beliefs. Being wrong absolutely sucks, but being wrong and doing nothing about it is even worse."

However, my clients had other ideas.The work started to pour in.\n\nOf course, there are positives to this, after all, I\u2019m going to get paid for it, but as a freelancer, my responsibility is to give the best service I can, which isn\u2019t always possible when your in-tray is growing exponentially, and the hours pass feeling as though nothing is achieved.\n\nRefining myself to my house for several days \u2014 slowly contracting cabin fever while my friends travelled abroad to attend a European festival \u2014 was not great for my mood and my productivity started to plummet.\n\nI was starting to get stressed out, miserable and lethargic.\n\nOf course, most of us \u2014 me included \u2014 would panic, thinking along the lines of;\n\nHowever, starting my week with a 15-hour day basically burnt me out, leaving me with no energy to carry on and the jobs started to pile up.\n\nOn top of this, the rest of my life started to become affected. For several hours a day, I would have a little burst of productivity around the beginning of the afternoon, where, in hindsight, I was only achieving the bare minimum.\n\nOther jobs like tidying the house, getting my washing done, cleaning the car, even going food shopping started to fall by the wayside \u2014 yet I\u2019m still not sick of eating crisps and hummus.\n\nI haven\u2019t even found the time to write on here \u2014 excluding a short post yesterday which was just a bit of a rant \u2014 which was just another factor crushing my mood.\n\nI tried working on my short story but couldn\u2019t find the inspiration to write. I attempted to read, but couldn\u2019t find the concentration or focus.\n\nI practiced yoga and mediation every morning for longer periods of time than I normally would, yet failed to find that spark.\n\nAs I said, it\u2019s been one of those weeks.\n\nYet, when I woke up this morning \u2014 four days into this heartbreaking week \u2014 something had changed.\n\nI shot out of bed around 8am, meditated and did ten minutes of yoga, had breakfast, brushed my teeth, started up my laptop and just smashed it.\n\nI started work around 9am and at the time of writing, it\u2019s just gone five in the evening, managing to stay on task all day, bar the half hour of Friends I watched while having lunch.\n\nThis took me by surprise.\n\nWhy after four days of pure creative block, a standstill in productivity and a complete lack of motivation entirely have I managed to suddenly get back on form and to where I want to be?\n\nI was even able to drag myself to the gym tonight for the first time this week!\n\nI\u2019ve always believed the key to success is self-reflection.\n\nBeing able to look back at yourself, evaluating the decisions you\u2019ve made, considering how you\u2019ll do things better next time is the only way you\u2019ll be able to move forward positively.\n\nOr Voss from the Farcry 3 game, which is where I first heard it.\n\nSo, refocusing my attention to what I believe in, I anaylsed the journey my mind had on over the last few days.\n\nAt the beginning of the week I was tired, that I know. I went too hard at the weekend for what wasn\u2019t a special event or something out of the ordinary; it was just a night on the town.\n\nThis left me burnt out and, quite frankly, exhausted, especially for someone who\u2019s a little introverted by nature.\n\nInstantly, this means I\u2019m going to be achieving less, no matter how hard I push myself because I have less energy to give. Of course, looking back, I should have had an early night on Monday, giving me more energy to push on come Tuesday.\n\nThis exhaustion was consequently stretched over the week. As the abnormal amount of work came in, the stress started to rise, further fuelling the exhaustion\n\nCome Wednesday, my week had fully become challenging. I could see myself thinking of everything this way. Every time I looked at my to-do list I would sigh. I sighed to the point where I no longer looked at it, causing my productivity to drop further, and so the vicious cycle began and continued.\n\nMy mood sunk lower, and my motivation dropped. It was challenging to get up in the morning because I knew what kind of day lay ahead.\n\nIt was challenging to carry on with work because I knew that there was plenty more where that came from.\n\nIt was challenging to find the inspiration to write for myself on here and on my story because I felt my attention should be on other things.\n\nIt was challenging to do anything because of a countless number of little excuses I could make up and fill the Medium servers with.\n\nI found myself becoming scared of failing, doubting myself and what I could achieve.\n\nWhat if I fail a client and I\u2019m unable to complete the work when I said it would be completed? What if I lose said clients for that reason? What if I never find the inspiration to write for myself again?\n\nBut, of course, there are no such things as challenges.\n\nWhen the Apollo 11 spaceflight left Earth, taking Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the journey itself was challenging. There were many obstacles to overcome. It goes without saying that the astronauts \u2014 and everyone else involved in the mission \u2014 would have been scared.\n\nThe odds seem to be towered up and stacked against them. There are so many things to go wrong, and the odds would almost definitely have seemed stacked against them.\n\nBut at the end of it all, they had the opportunity to make human history.\n\nThen again, don\u2019t we all?\n\nThis is just three people on their own journey through life.\n\nImagine waking up as Armstrong or Buzz the morning you were scheduled to fly. Hell, they probably didn\u2019t even sleep the night before with the weight of the situation that laid ahead of them. Their training, decades of it, must have been exhausting, especially in the month leading up to the launch itself.\n\nYet they still pushed on."

        "text": "For those of you who don\u2019t know, marketing automation refers to the practice of using software to schedule or automate routine marketing tasks.\n\nAutomation is important for two reasons:\n\nImagine you are having a very busy week.\n\nYou\u2019ve just signed up a new client, or maybe there\u2019s a fire to put out at home.\n\nSpending 40 minutes on your social media platforms is no longer a priority.\n\nEvery time one of these fires or distractions pops up you are likely to sideline your dedicated social media time for that day or do it poorly.\n\nAutomation makes sure this doesn\u2019t happen and helps you to remain consistent, which is by far the most important factor in achieving success online. Consistency = growth.\n\nIf you save yourself 30 minutes a day 5\u20136 days a week, you\u2019ve saved yourself 3\u20134 extra hours per week.\n\nWhat could you do with that time?\n\nThat\u2019s quite a nice chunk of free time. Instead of spending it manually doing routine tasks, you could spend it improving your content strategy or looking at some new ways to grow your business.\n\nWhy do you think millionaires and billionaires have personal assistants, teams of people on their staff, drivers and personal shoppers?\n\nBecause these people help give them more knowledge time. Time they can spend on high value activities that will help them continue to grow their wealth.\n\nOne thing I found when I embraced automation was my traffic began to creep up almost immediately, so did the rest of my performance metrics.\n\nBecause I was taking the time to batch my social media posting in advance, I was making sure I was religiously posting 4x per day.\n\nPreviously, I might not post for a week at a time when I got really busy, or try to overcompensate and post a load of stuff over a few days.\n\nTurns out, the universe rewards consistency and incremental growth.\n\nIf you think someone is going to subscribe to your list or buy from you after seeing 1 or 2 tweets, or posts on LinkedIn, you\u2019re wrong.\n\nIt can takes months, even years to nurture business relationships.\n\nThe upside is when you embrace automation, you are consistently posting everyday, making sure you are building thought leadership with your audience every single day.\n\nYour audience will begin to trust you, rely on and refer to you as an authority in your field. Then if they ever do need help with a project, you will be the person they turn to.\n\nA large chunk of my traffic comes from social referrals.\n\nIf you\u2019re still figuring out a marketing strategy and only getting a tiny amount of traffic from social media platforms, say 10\u201320 visitors per month, it\u2019s probably due to the fact that you aren\u2019t consistent and aren\u2019t delivering value.\n\nIf you are consistently creating new helpful, shareable content and focusing 90% of your time on giving away value for free, your traffic will grow.\n\nThe more free value you share, the more eyeballs your content gets, which means you get more referrals to your website which means a lot more traffic.\n\nAutomating your social media sharing ensures that the content you work so hard to create is seen by the right number of people at the right times. It doesn\u2019t matter how great your content is if you don\u2019t promote it.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to get seen across all the social media platforms, so you need to ensure you have an intelligent schedule where you share valuable content multiple times across the week to give it the best chance of being seen.\n\nEven the big guys like Richard Branson do it, and will often even repost the same article twice in one day at different times, with an altered status to accompany it.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about annoying people with your content don\u2019t be. There are people who will complain about anything and everything especially on social media, and if they aren\u2019t interested in free value, don\u2019t be worried if they decide to unfollow and go elsewhere. It\u2019s their loss! As long as you are delivering value and not trying to sell, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nSign up for Buffer, which is free to start with.\n\nTurn your 30\u201340 minute unproductive social media time each day into 5 minutes of focused scheduling.\n\nUsing Buffer, you can connect all of your social media platforms and schedule posts at predetermined times each day, across every platform.\n\nDo this everyday for 30 days and watch your traffic double.\n\nAs you begin to settle into this routine, look at upgrading to the premium version of Buffer which lets you schedule more posts in advance, so you can really take advantage of batching and schedule all your posts at the start of the week."

        "title": "Multitasking is Killing Your Brain \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Many people believe themselves to be multitasking masters, but could it all be in their heads?\n\nOur brains are designed to focus on one thing at a time, and bombardingthem with information only slows them down.\n\nMIT neuroscientist Earl Miller notes that our brains are \u201cnot wired to multitask well\u2026 when people think they\u2019re multitasking, they\u2019re actually justswitching from one task to another very rapidly. And every time they do,there\u2019s a cognitive cost.\u201d\n\nThis constant task-switching encourages bad brain habits. When we complete a tiny task (sending an email, answering a text message, posting a tweet), we are hit with a dollop of dopamine, our reward hormone. Our brains love that dopamine, and so we\u2019re encouraged to keep switching between small mini-tasks that give us instant gratification.\n\nThis creates a dangerous feedback loop that makes us feel like we\u2019re accomplishing a ton, when we\u2019re really not doing much at all (or at least nothing requiring much critical thinking). In fact, some even refer to email/Twitter/Facebook-checking as a neural addiction.\n\nMultitasking makes it more difficult to organize thoughts and filter out irrelevant information, and it reduces the efficiency and quality of our work.\n\nA study at the University Of London showed that subjects who multitasked while performing cognitive tasks experienced significant IQ drops. In fact, the IQ drops were similar to what you see in individuals who skip a night of sleep or who smoke marijuana. Now that\u2019s a terrifying thought.\n\nMultitasking has also been found to increase production of cortisol, the stresshormone. Having our brain constantly shift gears pumps up stress and tires us out, leaving us feeling mentally exhausted (even when the work day hasbarely begun).\n\nThe biggest instigator of multitasking mayhem? Our inboxes. Some studies have shown that even the opportunity to multitask, such as knowledge of an unread email in your inbox, can reduce your effective IQ by 10 points! The constant thrill of a new bolded email in our inbox keeps us ever-distracted. AMcKinsey Global Institute Study found that employees spend 28 percent of their workweek checking emails.\n\nEmail is problematic, but texting is even worse, demanding even more immediacy than email, having us check it more adamantly as a result.\n\nProtect yourself from the multitasking mental massacre by establishing an e-mail checking schedule. Commit yourself to checking emails only three times a day, (maybe when you get into work in the morning, at lunch time, and before leaving work at the end of the day). Turn off texting notifications and choose specific times to check your phone as well.\n\nFor men, multitasking can drop IQ as much as 15 points, essentially turningyou into the cognitive equivalent of an 8-year-old. Don\u2019t be surprised when you find yourself stocking up on pop rocks.\n\nNew research suggests the possibility that cognitive damage associated with multi-tasking could be permanent.\n\nA study from the University of Sussex (UK) ran MRI scans on the brains ofindividuals who spent time on multiple devices at once (texting while watching TV, for example). The MRI scans showed that subjects who multitasked more often had less brain density in the anterior cingulate cortex.That\u2019s the area responsible for empathy and emotional control.\n\nThe one caveat is that research isn\u2019t detailed enough to determine if multitasking is responsible for these effects, or if existing brain damage results in multitasking habits. Still, no matter how you spin it, multitasking is no good.\n\nThe lesson? Multitasking is not a skill to add to the resume, but rather a bad habit to put a stop to. Turn off notifications, create set email checking time slots throughout the day (rather than constant inbox refreshing), and put your mind to the task at hand.\n\nGet my very best Unicorn marketing & entrepreneurship growth hacks:\n\n1.

        "title": "82 Experts Share Their Favorite Influencer Marketing Tips to Increase Exposure",
        "text": "With the staggering amount of promotional material consumers are exposed to, they\u2019ve started turning a blind eye to it. This makes it increasingly difficult for brands to connect with people and get the word out about themselves. It\u2019s also very easy for your content to get lost amongst that of your competitors online.\n\nHow can your brand gain more exposure and reach more people? The answer lies in influencer marketing. Word-of-mouth marketing remains one the most powerful marketing strategies there is. And in essence, that\u2019s what influencer marketing is all about. The only difference is that the conversations have moved from being in person to being online on social media.\n\nBrands are collaborating with key social leaders to gain the public exposure they desire. By having influencers talk about and promote you in their circles, your brand can generate buzz about yourself. People are more trusting of a brand that has been publicly endorsed by local or global celebrities or influencers.\n\nInfluencers are usually experts in their niches and have loyal fan bases. By collaborating with these niche influencers, your brand can reach a larger target audience. One you typically wouldn\u2019t be able to.\n\nYou can also leverage influencers to generate useful and informative content about your products and services. This helps your target audience to make an informed and educated purchase decision. Influencer-generated content like reviews or testimonials is a great way to help you get that kind of brand visibility.\n\nFor more insights into some great influencer marketing tips to increase exposure, let\u2019s take a look at what the top industry experts have to say below.\n\nPlease note: This roundup has been structured in ascending order, and not according to expertise.\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret that large communities that once used to have a huge impact on the digital landscape no longer have the same power. Users have shifted to smaller communities, which is where the real conversations happen now.\n\nAs a result, a tiny number of bloggers who still hold sufficient share of the market can really influence their readers\u2019 decision-making process and convince them to purchase products and services. But while well-known influencers can help your brand become more recognizable, they won\u2019t bring you short-term results like traffic and conversions. And that\u2019s where you need to turn to smaller communities for help.\n\nHere are a few influencer marketing tips on how you can find these close-knit communities that will bring you new visitors who are ready to click the \u201cbuy\u201d button:\n\n2. LinkedIn groups and LinkedIn posts/articles that are trending\n\n3. Analyze what sites bring traffic to your competitors. To do this, use SimilarWeb\n\n4. Find users that are active on Twitter. By active, I don\u2019t mean those who post on a regular basis; we need those who interact with other users.\n\n5. Find out where your audience is and ask questions about similar products and services. Among those platforms could be Reddit, Quora, etc.\n\nMake your streams less about you and more about cheering on/amplifying all the new research, advancements and leadership you see in the entire sector. Connect the dots to broader trends and make YOUR streams the curation of all anyone needs to know, with a positive angle.\n\nYou may occasionally share and cheer on your \u201ccompetition\u201d \u2014 but that is even more of a cue that you are to be trusted, and followers will note your generosity. It\u2019s about the cause or bigger problem you are solving, and NOT your immediate business.\n\nAlong the way, lots of new people will find you and you\u2019ll gain a reputation as an influencer \u2014 and that means more journalists are likely to see you as a source, too. It\u2019s a longer game, but so much more rewarding.\n\nThis is the fastest, easiest and most effective way to collaborate with influencers. It doesn\u2019t work for celebrities, but it\u2019s great for the micro-influencers who have the attention of your audience. Add a quote from them in your content. Then when you share it, mention them in social media.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy, don\u2019t take short cuts. Here are two ways to make it more effective for you.\n\nWorking with influencers to co-create content can be an incredibly effective way to build authority and credibility for brand content. It can also increase the reach of your content and put you in front of new and engaged audiences.\n\nHowever, influencer marketing isn\u2019t as simple as it seems. There is a certain element of wooing that goes along with enticing influencers to participate with you and even more when it comes to convincing them to share. If you want your influencer marketing to actually increase exposure you need to:\n\n#1. Identify the RIGHT Kind of Influencers\n\nDepending on your objective, you\u2019ll want to work with a mix of different influencer types. While brandividuals have extensive reach, they may not have the deep expertise that more niche influencers (often with smaller networks) do. Let your goals lead the type of influencers you choose to co-create with.\n\n#2. Show Influencers What\u2019s in it for Them\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes that marketers make is leading with what they want from the influencers, versus the benefits to the individual. Some collaboration will require payment but not all. In order to make it worth their time, you have to outline the clear benefits for them which could include increased exposure, brand affiliation, etc.\n\n#3. Make it Easy for Influencers to Share\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if your content is great, you still have to entice your influencers to amplify the content they co-created. Many experts (especially those that do this professionally) have very limited time. So, to make it easy, send along pre-written social messages and image bundles so that they simply need to copy and paste the messages you\u2019ve written to their social networks.\n\nNever pay a % of your media spend to a marketplace, network or 3rd party who middle-mans the influencer relationship. The 3rd party has a built-in incentive to maximize your cash-costs, it creates a super transactional experience, and you get worse content.\n\nThe better alternative is to build long-term and direct relationships with influencers. When you do this you maximize your budget by paying with product, drive higher ROI and get much better content. Go direct!\n\nWhen pursuing increased exposure with influencer marketing, don\u2019t let yourself get overly consumed by vanity metrics. Set clear goals from the beginning. For example, your goal could be conversions in the form of e-newsletter subscriptions. Once that\u2019s established, focus on exposure and campaign metrics that have a positive correlation with your conversion goals.\n\nThen, identify a well-defined target audience. For a brand promoting B2C products or services with mass appeal, you\u2019ll likely want to cast a wider net than a niche or B2B brand. This will help you steer your efforts toward influencers and micro-influencers generating exposure to the best audiences for your brand \u2014 which aren\u2019t always the biggest.\n\nVanity metrics can tank your influencer marketing ROI if they tempt you to go off course and away from the audiences and outcomes that matter most to your brand. So while increased exposure is important, make sure the exposure is worthy of the time and resources you use to attain it.\n\nAuthenticity. Genuine relationships. These are the types of words and phrases thrown around when it comes to influencer marketing. Truth is, those words are fluff unless they\u2019re coupled with specific details on how.\n\nIf you want to build a relationship with an influencer, solicit their services just as any other customer might. Too often marketers come at influencer marketing from a kind of co-marketing perspective, and this can be severely short sighted.\n\nIf you believe in the influencer\u2019s talent, invite them in to give a paid workshop, or ask them to speak at a company event. This shows them that you take their work (not just their influence) seriously, and it\u2019ll likely improve the knowledge of your company.\n\nThis, in my mind, is a great way to plant the seed for a deeper relationship to blossom.\n\nFrom there, sure, put on that co-marketing hat. But break free from thinking about results six days from now and instead stay focused on what can happen six months down the road as the relationship is nurtured.\n\nHire a portfolio of micro-influencers to highlight your business, brand and products/services, using a service like Tinysponsor , where I am an investor and influencer myself.\n\nDoing this allows you to leverage the audiences that others have built in a cost-effective way, as research has shown that micro-influencers generate a better engagement on a percentage basis that even celebrity influencers.\n\nPlus, a tech-based platform like Tinysponsor will easily help you sort through who has actual influence and engagement, not just a big following, as those are not always correlated. Doing small campaigns with smaller budgets lets you test the efficacy and help you to maximize your return on investment.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to pay influencers to get them to really commit to a campaign. In some cases, having a big fish influencer that was paid can lead to access to other influencers that you don\u2019t have to pay. FOMO helps in this case.\n\nBe 100% focused on helping people, rather than trying to be an influencer. This means not just posting on your own channels, but also scanning, sharing, commenting, and engaging. Be part of the community you want to support.\n\nThe most effective tactic I\u2019ve found to increase exposure is to do a concentrated campaign in bursts where your target customer sees your content all over social accounts.\n\nInfluencer marketing is a powerful tactic that can provide high ROI. However, to achieve this first, you have to ensure that your influencer is targeting the market you are seeking to address and that they actually have an engaged audience.\n\nNext, focus on the ROI you are targeting and define the objective and goals you are seeking from influencer marketing. Some common ones are: increased visibility (brand awareness), traffic to a specific site, or maybe generating (X) amount of leads or sales.\n\nThese in turn, impact the type of influencer you may want to target. For example, if you want traffic back to your site, you should look for an influencer who has high traffic and is willing to push a link to your site. If you want brand awareness, maybe a social media influencer with high engagement is the way to go.\n\nThere are many more influencer marketing tips to share, but this one is key. Use your objectives to set up the parameters for your success and execute toward those. This is often the difference between success and frustration.\n\nThe most effective influencer marketing tips I can give anyone to increase exposure is to not think about exposure/impressions first.\n\nInstead, think about the interest level and engagement of the perspective influencer audience. An interested and engaged audience is much more likely to convert than a \u201cbroad\u201d audience.\n\nTo do this, go after micro influencers rather than the \u201cbig\u201d influencers. Not only will this help your conversions, you\u2019re likely to secure less expensive rates from micro influencers due to their audience size.\n\nCurate a round up of industry influencers and reach out to those influencers to let them know that you have featured them (like this round up that you\u2019re reading).\n\nI\u2019ve written a step by step tutorial showing you how to do this here. Why does this work? Influencers love their egos being stroked and are likely to share your article out to their large network. This provides an influx of free traffic to your website and a ton of exposure.\n\nHaving an online asset that others would love to be a part of can give you major street credit with other influencers.\n\nTake for example my website. It\u2019s a website devoted to listing the best SciFi books in their different genres. But because of this, and it\u2019s traffic, I\u2019ve become a well known name in the Science Fiction world.\n\nIt\u2019s landed me some consulting gigs and has allowed me to work side-by-side with some of my all-time favorite authors. It\u2019s helped me to get meetings and even had me be a guest at the Writers Of The Future award ceremony.\n\nTo increase exposure, create relationships with influencers for the long term. I\u2019d rather have a smaller group of influencers who are active brand ambassadors than a larger list of one-time friends who support a brand.\n\nThe more you know about an influencer and how they like to participate in your marketing program, the better. Influencers enjoy specific activities and it\u2019s your job to know their preferences; from the people who will participate in your blog content and ebooks to those who choose to speak at your events and like to showcase your products.\n\nSimilar to the days of media relations and understanding a reporter\u2019s beat, your influencers have an area of interest that excites them and their community members. Feed their passion with their favorite activities and you\u2019ll get friends and brand advocates who stick by you for the long haul.\n\nFocus on quality rather than quantity: identify not the biggest influencers but those that truly impact your target audience, play win-win and build the relationships over time, listen to them and collaborate as they know their audience better than you do. If you do this, your costs will decrease over time while your impact will increase.\n\nPS \u2014 I think exposure is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nDo a test with an influencer before signing a long-term contract. Many \u201cinfluencers\u201d have large numbers but that doesn\u2019t equate to their ability to drive conversions.\n\nAlways, always make sure that the influencer\u2019s content is on-brand with your product. An influencer can have all the reach in the world but if their audience isn\u2019t interested in your category, they won\u2019t be engaged.\n\n1) Approach influencer marketing with the same test and invest mentality as any growth channel!\n\n2) Identify several, diverse groups of influencers that match different personas of your customer audience and get enough sample size for each. If you use too small of a sample size it will be hard to get actionable learnings from the data to build on.\n\n3) Define your goals and how to measure success first before establishing a strategy. If you\u2019re looking for maximum exposure + engagement within an audience that is going to be a very different tactic than driving clicks/traffic/sales conversions or generating creative for a paid social ad campaign. There are highly effective ways to utilize influencers for every part of the marketing funnel, but executing each of them is very different.\n\n4) Remember that each influencer is a personal relationship. Don\u2019t treat it as transactional. Even if you use a platform, make sure that each of your touchpoints is personalized because you\u2019re selling the influencer on why they should be excited just as much as they are selling you on why to pick them. The best influencer programs we\u2019ve seen show the highest ROI from influencers in month 3+ because it\u2019s clear those influencers believe in the product/brand so much.\n\n5) Utilize the full value of influencers by not just having them post on their own social media, but licensing their content for your entire marketing stack. Because influencers are a relatively low cost, hugely scalable option for content creation, you can personalize almost every marketing channel (paid social, e-commerce, email marketing) based on hundreds of images and videos you can create through influencers on a monthly basis.\n\nYou can then evaluate which types of influencers resonate with which audience segments, on which channels the best. The biggest e-commerce brands in the world use influencers as content creation vehicles more than they use them for traditional influencer marketing.\n\nAnd of course finally \u2014 if you\u2019re serious about building a large scale influencer program in-house, use Revfluence because we\u2019re the only solution specifically built for all of the above.\n\nThe fastest way to grow is to connect with influencers who already have your target audience. Before asking for anything from them though, look to provide value first.\n\nBe a member of their community. Be the first to respond to their posts. Write insightful comments and replies. Follow them on all the networks they post on. Pay close attention to where they are personally involved and responding. That\u2019s where you have your best shot and getting on their radar.\n\nYour name and face should be known to them. They should see you so often and think you bring so much value that they can\u2019t help but want to click on your profile to learn about this superfan who is a huge part of their community. Then when you reach out you\u2019re far more likely to get a yes.\n\n1) After segmenting your influencer targets by topic, group them by influence.\n\nHigh influence (e.g. >5,000 Instagram followers, >10,000 Twitter followers) will have the biggest reach of course, but they will also be the most difficult to leverage, because they will either be already committed to influencer programs, or will be expensive.\n\nLow influence (e.g. 1,000\u20132,500 Instagram followers, 2,000\u20135,000 Twitter followers) will have a smaller reach but will be accessible to you in high volumes.\n\n2) Train one of your team members (or yourself) on a repeatable process for outreach. If you can find an influencer\u2019s email (usually easiest if they\u2019re a blogging influencer rather than purely social), that\u2019s great, but if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via social media.\n\nDirectly engaging with influencers on Instagram and Twitter is commonplace and valuable. Use a Twitter outreach tool like ManageFlitter to identify, sort and engage with Twitter influencers.\n\n3) Make it easy for them to engage. Don\u2019t require a lot of time or work from them, but give them an offer (particularly the first time you work with them) that makes it difficult to refuse.\n\nExample: product comps or payment in exchange for a few social posts. Obviously, this is a lot to do for not much value to your business, but then, when you later return for a longer-term, larger-scale campaign where you want more direct influencer involvement and ask for more of their time, they\u2019ve already said yes to you. Makes it that much easier to say yes again!\n\nIt seems simple, but it\u2019s absolutely vital to be certain that the influencer you select for your product or brand fits everywhere. Having an influencer means advertising to two audiences: your followers, and the influencer\u2019s followers \u2014 and people with big reputations have fanbases who will immediately see through something they don\u2019t feel makes sense for their faves.\n\nMichelle Obama, for example, would not be a good match as an influencer for junk food. It\u2019s really a merging of two brands \u2014 and authenticity is a key thing to remember for increasing exposure with this kind of marketing.\n\nInfluencer marketing is a form of marketing. The best influencer marketing tip is to apply the same fundamentals. Find influencers that have a strong following within your target audience and can actually impact decision making. Fame doesn\u2019t equal influencer. Chef Chaya doesn\u2019t have the same audience as Kim Kardashian.\n\nMy no. 1 tip is that influencer marketing isn\u2019t a short term solution. It needs to be grounded in long-term strategy and a real commitment to building a relationship with the influencers.\n\nSo all the stuff that is important for this kind of program should be considered. Time and money commitments, internal responsibility, clarity on what you\u2019re trying to achieve and how you would measure it.\n\nEveryone always wants to go for the big names, the celebrities, the people everyone recognizes. But the true value is in the micro-influencer. The person who has 100 followers, but every one of them reverently does what the influencer says. And I will take 100% activation and engagement over less than one percent any day.\n\nAt its core, influencer marketing is about tapping into communities of trust. An influencer is someone who has already created and nurtured a community that is primed to trust the content of the influencer.\n\nAgencies and brands must carefully vet influencers to ensure that they are closely aligned with the brand\u2019s values \u2014 and once this is done, the influencer should be provided with access and opportunities to tap into the influencer\u2019s own creativity and community.\n\nThe real homework in influencer marketing is in finding the right influencers and micro-influencers who are passionate, creative and responsible in their own content creation and community engagement so that they can be trusted to craft a series of shares that will enliven the brand\u2019s inventory of content and engagement.\n\nEmpower influencers with access to do what they do best: take experiences and share them in ways that spark the imaginations of others!\n\nJust because someone is labeled as an \u201cinfluencer\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they know how to sell. I only consider someone an influencer if they have the ability to actually persuade someone into taking action.\n\nCelebrities online are seen as authorities but many aren\u2019t able to actually influence anyone to take action. If you want your \u201cinfluencer\u201d to promote your product, they better know how to actually sell because the idea that an \u201cinfluencer\u201d will somehow magically close deals down is a fairytale.\n\nSo my influencer marketing tip for you is that you still have to learn to sell and learn to close. And yes, selling and closing are 2 completely different arts.\n\nInfluencer marketing is one of the most effective marketing tactics out there today. Great influencer marketing campaigns generate authentic content and exposure that are invaluable for the brand. Some quick influencer marketing tips:\n\n1. Choose the right influencers. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Make sure you are focusing on influencers whose audience is relevant to your brand. Look at audience demographics, engagement rates, and previous brand work they\u2019ve been involved in.\n\n2. Stay authentic \u2014 let your influencers have their own voice. You can provide general guidelines and brand values, but make sure your influencers get to keep their own voice. Remember, you need them to generate unique content that feels real, not ads.\n\n3. Measure and iterate. Track performance and analyze your success.\n\nMy favorite influencer marketing tip includes mega-roundups (like this) and influencer commentary in articles and ebooks since they put the expert\u2019s opinion in context for the audience. Further, I favor the use of micro-influencers, especially people within your community, since they have trust and credibility with your audience.\n\nInfluencer content works wonderfully when it is leveraged as paid social content on Facebook. Collective Bias turns the influencer\u2019s rich imagery into content and displays it to Facebook\u2019s total addressable audience of 200 million.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that the content works its magic to the tune of 2 percent average CTRs. I spoke with Jacob Snelson, our Director of Media Operations and Strategy, who confirmed, \u201cThe average click-through rate (CTR) for Facebook ads across all industries is 0.90 percent. The key to increasing engagement is placing the right content in front of relevant audiences.\u201d\n\nWhen you involve influencers opinions in your content you add some authority to your content and increase your own influence. Looking for opportunities to quote something they have said or written about and reach out to them to let them know you have quoted them.\n\nInterviewing them is another way of involving them in your content and it helps build the relationship. Use a tool such as OutreachPlus to help personalize and track all communication with them. You need to build up a profile of them, be aware of what they said for previous emails and track all their response.\n\nAnother great way of involving influencers is pre-promoting your content. Share your post to a group of influencers before you post it and ask their opinion. Add their feedback to the post and then reach out after you post it to let them know.\n\nSet a goal to get in front of a number of your perfect avatar, and then let it be a numbers game. If it\u2019s 100,000 then do whatever you can to get in front of large audiences to hit over that number \u2014 make friends/guest post/get on podcasts/ get in front of ten times that.\n\nYou\u2019ll get to be an influencer more being in front of people over and over and over again then just playing it too small. (social tactics don\u2019t work nearly as well as getting in front of already built huge communities!)\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to find an influencer, but it\u2019s another thing amplify the campaigns they\u2019re doing on your behalf. Many businesses make the mistake of simply relying on the influencer\u2019s organic reach to increase exposure, but I\u2019ve found that any organic campaign needs to be supplemented by a paid campaign.\n\nSo remember to continue doing your organic campaigns, but use paid media to amplify them. That one-two punch can be very powerful indeed.\n\nI like to use expert roundups to source ideas and place them into behemoth guides.\n\nIf you notice in this guide on influencer marketing, to the untrained eye, it looks like a normal guide.\n\nBut if you dig deeper, there are around 20 experts mentioned.\n\nAs a result, not only does it give opportunity for waves of traffic, it also increases the article\u2019s credibility because the experts are used as social proof.\n\nThe biggest tip I have when it comes to increasing exposure with influencer marketing is to appeal to your audience. It\u2019s an absolute must to first create a genuine and authentic brand.\n\nOnce you do that, you need to create content that is going to appeal to your audience and resonate with them. Focus on creating valuable content and everything else will come afterwards. Don\u2019t focus on the influencers that have the largest followings or the most engagement.\n\nInstead, focus on an influencer that fits your vision. You know who your audience or customers are, now which influencers cater to them? It\u2019s all about quality instead of quantity when it comes to influencer marketing for the best exposure!\n\nMy most effective influencer marketing tip is to make the request personal, and make sure there is something in it for the influencer you would like to reach. It\u2019s one thing to put out a bunch of thoughtless, generic requests to post more pointless content on the Internet.\n\nIt\u2019s something else to really focus on creating a valuable contribution with your influencer outreach. It\u2019s more than just getting exposed to a larger audience, it\u2019s about making the influencer actually care about the subject of the post just as much as you do.\n\nThe most in-demand influencers are approached hundreds of times a month to contribute to various articles. How is your approach different? What gets them excited to contribute? What about your pitch is the most exciting email they will receive that entire month? Make it personal, make it interesting, and make them say \u201cyes\u201d without even thinking twice.\n\nBe selective. If you\u2019re going to be sponsored to promote a product or service, it needs to be something that you genuinely support and use.\n\nWhen you\u2019re truly excited about a product, it will show in the messages and videos that you produce. If you\u2019re not, it will likely come off as rehearsed and scripted.\n\nThe most impactful influencers out there are guided by authenticity and transparency. It doesn\u2019t always have to be polished, but it does have to be personal.\n\nIt\u2019s important to target influencers with highly-engaged audiences and not just the largest ones (follower counts can be inflated very easily with just a few bucks on Fiverr).\n\nYou\u2019ll find that some influencers have enormous public stats \u2014 Twitter followers, Facebook likes \u2014 but you need to check how engaged their readership and followers really are. A hundred thousand followers on Twitter but just a couple likes on a Tweet? Ten thousand likes but just one share on a Facebook post? No thanks.\n\nDo the extra work to find influencers with highly engaged audiences and your marketing budget will go that much further.\n\nOne the most effective things you can do is consistently interact with influencers in person on social channels. The fact is that the more time you give professionally to social channels such as Twitter or Linkedin the more you will get out of it.\n\nWhat that looks like is positively interjecting yourself into influencer conversations that address your area of expertise. In this fashion, over time you can increase your exposure as a thought leader, not only among influencers, but among the many thousands of people who pay attention to them.\n\nPeople who have larger social followings are just like you. They loved to be talked to, even catered too. Give them free exposure by speaking to them in front of your followers fairly often, and they will see you are someone with whom they should cultivate a relationship.\n\nThe biggest influencer marketing tip I can offer up here is to make sure you\u2019re partnering with the right influencer to help promote your brand and increase your exposure.\n\nThe best way to do this is to make sure that the influencer has a substantial following, but also that his or her followers are engaged. You want this influencer to fit with your brand and create a union that makes total sense. It needs to be authentic in order to really reach their audience, so make sure you partner with someone who has the right type of influence and that seamlessly fits with your product and/or brand message.\n\nOne of the biggest changes I see is a rise in experiential marketing as part of influencer marketing tactics to connect and engage with specific audience segments. The online events, in addition to the interaction with the influencers online, increase exposure and draw more people who are seeking to meet these influencers in person just like they would with celebrities. It\u2019s an excellent way to connect your off-line and online marketing tactics and deepen those relationships.\n\nA influencer is a person capable of make movement in other people in a natural way, and based on the trust that he has created in others. So it is important that brands understand that this is a different kind of advertising, and if they want to be successful in their campaigns, I mean, increase exposure and get business results, they should follow the next influencer marketing tips:\n\n-Create an influence map based on micro-influence. What it is mean don\u00b4t focus on numbers of followers, and focus on engagement and online reputation. For example in this image you can see a potential influence map for women in a concrete field.\n\nFor creating the map you can use professional tools and look on Google for the main keywords in the industry you want to create an impact.\n\n-Don\u00b4t make bulk, I mean, when you have the influencers that you want to contact, create a personalized message, and send them by email or private message in any social network. So think about them and use what I called Karma 2.0: Give 10 times more that you expect, and you will receive 10 time more that you were expected.\n\n\u2013 Think in the long-term. The real successful influencer market is not about an specific action, it is about to create a relationship between the brand and the influencer, in order to create value for your audience day by day and month by mont.\n\n\u2013 And last but not least, you have to create a dashboard for tracking the results of each influencer. You can see here a snap of a very simple dashboard .\n\nBesides, depends on the audience that you want to influence, first of all you have to know and understand them. For example, millennials has some things in common. If you want more information about them, you can watch this talk that I gave about How to Impact to Millenials.\n\nInfluencers don\u2019t force themselves on their audience. Their audience follows them because they like and/or respect them.\n\nOne of the things that is key in selecting an influencer is that not only do they need to have reach (providing exposure to new audiences), but the audience also needs to be loyal, so the audience can be influenced to perform an action.\n\nWith this in mind, transparency and authenticity is key. The more the influencer believes in the brand they\u2019re promoting, the more authentic they will be and the more successful the campaign will be.\n\nWithout a doubt, video is the most potent way to share your message in today\u2019s crowded marketplace.\n\nThe main question is do you not if but when you will be begin and if you are already doing this how can you improve the process.\n\nI prefer to pre-record my videos and then edit them into \u201csnackable snippets\u201d that I can share easily and that my followers can enjoy on the go.\n\nMany of my friends prefer to live stream in the moment and that works really well for them as well.\n\nEither way video is HUGE now so find a way to incorporate it into your strategy.\n\nYou will find that your engagement will EXPLODE when you do.\n\nTarget, target, and target again! I can\u2019t say this enough.\n\nWhen looking at an influencer, you have to make sure their community is a good fit \u2014 because working with an influencer who has 10,000 targeted followers is more effective than working with someone who has 1,000,000 followers who would not use your service or product.\n\nThink of this process as you would fishing. You will not catch anything with the wrong bait. And the influencer is your bait. If the people in your influencer\u2019s network do not fit the profile of your ideal customer, then partnering with them with not benefit your business.\n\nBefore you start reaching out to influencers, you\u2019ll have to do some research. Create an ideal customer profile (or persona) for your brand. Who are you targeting? What is the age range? What topics interest them? Where do they hang out? What are their biggest needs? If you have not defined your niche, then you\u2019d be better off doing absolutely nothing at all.\n\nNext, after you have the correct demographics in place, start your influencer search. Suggested tools to use: BuzzSumo (helps with searches) and GroupHigh (delivers monthly influencer lists).\n\nWhen the influencer responds to your request for information, make sure you ask for some data. You\u2019ll want to see engagement and click-through stats. Previous campaign information would be ideal.\n\nEngagement is becoming more important than ever in Influencer Marketing \u2014 not because it\u2019s a metric we all use to measure success, but because 2018 is the year that platforms are updating their algorithms to surface more \u2018relevant\u2019 content from people you love.\n\nThis essentially means that the more engagement an influencer can drive, the further the post will travel. Organic reach is making a comeback, and for the brands collaborating with influencers this is great news!\n\nIf you\u2019re working with influencers on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter \u2014 make sure you\u2019re building influencer programs that push for comments, likes, shares and views. I\u2019d even go as far as to say include cross-influencer sharing as part of your campaign roll out.\n\nYou can also increase engagement by asking influencers to include comment loops, giveaways and WOW content. Another trick we\u2019ve been using to get more brand exposure is by building squads of small micro-influencers, and getting them to engage with branded content as it\u2019s pushed out. This tactic uses influencers to push your engagement rates up, and get your content to organically travel further.\n\nBe helpful! Share and comment on your influencer network\u2019s content and always expand your network of influencers through mutual connections and by engaging in their ventures. Build a mutual relationship of goodwill, just like you do with your circle of friends, in order to help one another succeed. If you help others, they\u2019ll want to help you in return.\n\nThere are several important elements to a successful influencer marketing campaign and it all starts with the influencers you\u2019re using. Many focus on the wrong elements when choosing influencers \u2014 namely, their reach. The thinking being that the bigger an influencer is, the more effective the campaign will be, but that is not always the case.\n\nWhen researching influencers, it\u2019s important to look beyond vanity numbers. There are 2 main things to look for: the influencers\u2019 relevancy, and the level of their actual influence over their audience.\n\nLook at the influencers activity: what kind of content do they usually create and share? Who exactly forms their audience? Do you share the same target audience? If not, there\u2019s no point in targeting them \u2014 no matter how big their audience is.\n\nAnd secondly, you need to look at their engagement, namely, how engaged their audience is. Check their blog and website, as well as their social media profiles to see how many shares they get on their posts, if they get comments on their blog, and if their audiences engages with them regularly on social media.\n\nForget about follower numbers \u2014 it\u2019s much more profitable to use smaller, but relevant and respected influencers rather than huge influencers with little relevance to your business.\n\nAnalyze each micro-influencer\u2019s audience so you know who you\u2019re reaching with your partnership. Important factors include: age of followers, where they live, gender, engagement rate, % fake followers.\n\nBusinesses can increase brand exposure and sales through influencer marketing. You should use this type of campaign at least for a month in order to measure the result. It doesn\u2019t work with one time campaign. If after a month the campaign works for you, then use their service again. If you have a bigger budget hire several influencers to market your product or service.\n\nInfluencer marketing is better than paid ads and gives a faster result. It depends on your ad copy though. Make sure to target the right influencer for your product or service and it should be done at the right time of the day.\n\nYou must create quality campaigns that don\u2019t look or sound like an advertisement. That\u2019s the beauty of an influencer marketing. Create several ad copies along with pictures in high resolution and give them to your influencer to promote on his/her / their channels.\n\nIf you\u2019re targeting worldwide prospects for brand exposure and sales, choose the one who is communicating with targeted audience in different languages. There are more strategies and I will write an article about it. Make sure to create your ads in multiple languages.\n\nThe most successful influencer marketing programs are the ones where the influencer content is used beyond the original scope of the campaign to improve the performance of their paid, owned and earned media.\n\nMarketers looking to increase exposure should repurpose influencer content across a variety of channels, from email communications and website content to paid social and native advertising. 51% of marketers that repurpose influencer content report that it outperforms brand-created content, and of those who have yet to test influencer content against brand created content, 59% plan to do so this year.\n\nYou can expect to see more brands A/B testing influencer content against brand-created content to determine what pieces will deliver the best results. Advanced marketers will then develop a strategic blueprint using those assets to increase brand exposure and drive incremental performance from their paid, owned and earned media.\n\nBrands need to begin my choosing influencers that are relevant to their brand, not just influencers that have massive amounts of followers. Micro-influencers are now more impactful for increasing exposure than macro-influencers because most macro-influencers overused their influence to the point that their followers now tune them out.\n\nMicro-influencers have a better chance of sounding more authentic and establishing a real connection with their influencers. An authentic connection is what your brand needs in order to gain meaningful exposure that will lead to a social media relationship and brand awareness and loyalty.\n\nBrands need to spend their budget on multiple micro-influencers, rather than a couple of macro-influencers. Brands will not regret this influencer strategy.\n\nI think one of the most overlooked influencer strategies is brand partnerships. Look for brands that are non-competitors but have some crossover relevance to your business, and that also have a strong content and social presence. Develop a relationship with their key people and offer ways you could partner, such as a joint content project.\n\nA great example of this from a few years ago was when Playboy and Redbull teamed up to create a video of extreme cyclists jumping over pools filled with Playboy Bunnies at the Playboy mansion. The video had appeal to both brands\u2019 audiences, and was viewed by millions. We tell the story at StoneTemple.\n\nInfluencer marketing works best when brands create strategic relationships that don\u2019t feel like an influencer just being paid to promote something. Ask your influencers what they love to create and then discover how to create a series of content pieces that tie what they love together with your brand. So brand affinity + influencer consistency = influencer marketing success.\n\nPlanning for your B2B influencer marketing strategy requires an understanding of the 1:9:90 model of influence. This model, while it\u2019s not perfect, serves as a way to segment the market and build programs that deliver true business value.\n\nThe 1% of the market are influencers. They are the ones driving the conversation. They create buzzwords (think Digital Transformation), markets and categories. When they talk, others listen.\n\nThe 9% are what I call promoters. They share everything. Typically when the 1% have an opinion, the 9% will provide their own perspective and share it with everyone else.\n\nThe 90% is everyone that make up that market. I call them lurkers. They rely heavily upon search and word-of-mouth. They consume mass amounts of content but don\u2019t publish anything.\n\nOnce you identify the 1%, you\u2019ll have to formulate a strategy that amplifies engagement with them across paid, earned, shared and owned media.\n\nMy best advice is more of a mindset than a tactic, and that is to be patient. Influencer Marketing is all about building and nurturing relationships. That takes time!\n\nIf you rush into a relationship and start creating expectations before there is mutual trust and perceived value, that will create tension. And most influencers will react negatively to that kind of tension, resulting in the exact opposite behavior you\u2019re looking for.\n\nEvery business owner LOVES going out and hunting elephants.\n\nWe\u2019re like bloodhounds sniffing for opportunities everywhere.\n\nWe look to find prospects who can make the biggest purchases or \u201cinfluencers\u201d who can assist us in moving the dial the most in our business.\n\nI\u2019m all for going out and finding a way to partner with the biggest influencers in our Niche, but each of us has the opportunity inside our current network or customer base to watch a metamorphosis take place.\n\nThink of your current network like a bunch of potential BEAUTIFUL butterflies who can spread their wings and your message everywhere once that metamorphosis takes place.\n\nYou see, each of us are surrounded by caterpillars in our network or business that when developed can become magical butterflies that will spread your message to their tribe.\n\nEveryone is an influencer to their network, don\u2019t forget that.\n\nI believe the very first thing you should do before running out to set up an influencer marketing campaign is you should set up systems and procedures within your business immediately to encourage that metamorphosis to happen.\n\nYou already have a bunch of opportunities of individuals who have influence over one or many.\n\nWork with influencers who have the most passionate audience not necessarily the largest audience. There are for example YouTubers with large subscriber bases who\u2019s audiences are inactive and they get few views on new videos. Some small YouTubers have very passionate audiences who hang on every word the creator says.\n\nI think it\u2019s always important to start off with a tangible goal \u2014 something that you can easily envision and work towards. When it comes to increasing exposure and online presence, there are a lot of factors at play. Ultimately you\u2019re working towards becoming a thought leader, which means you need to share strategies and processes that you\u2019ve tested and used in the past, which have lead to success.\n\nKnowing that, you can then work backwards. Do some research into some of the low, mid and high tier thought-leaders that you look up to, and establish some milestones that you can work towards. These are your \u201ctangible\u201d goals.\n\nA milestone might be something as simple as \u201cGet 20 comments on a LinkedIn Post\u201d or something requiring a bit more perseverance like \u201cGet an article published on Forbes.\u201d Eventually all these little milestones add up and you find yourself becoming a lot more \u201cexposed\u201d online.\n\nThe most effective influencer marketing avenue I\u2019ve found to increase exposure is blogging! If you have an expertise and information to share, start blogging!\n\nWhether it is on your own blog or guest posting on more established blogs \u2014 sharing your insight is a great way to build an online community that trusts you as a resource. They then share your content to their community which brings fantastic increased exposure for your brand and business.\n\nIt\u2019s important to focus on exposure but more important to strive to add value. Tagging or mentioning individuals who will find your content valuable, and share with their audiences, is a great way to increase awareness of your efforts and add value to the greater community.\n\nAnother great influencer marketing tip is to share the piece of content with multiple headlines. Don\u2019t just use the title! Get creative. Pull out quotes, use bullets and emoji\u2019s to attract your target persona and encourage them to click and consume.\n\nSpecific to increasing exposure, my advice would be to look at an integrated media promotion to highlight a deeper look into your influencer\u2019s passions. In other words, it\u2019s great to share out your influencer\u2019s quote, and have them do the same.\n\nBut, instead of just asking them one question \u2014 take the time to understand what content THEY would like to promote. They may have a book, or an event, or something timely that would really work with thoughts that are related to your content, but specific to them. So \u2014 ask yourself how can you work that into whatever it is you\u2019re promoting.\n\nPerhaps, for example, you\u2019re looking to get a quote for one of your blog posts. How about asking another question about related to what you\u2019re talking about, but is something THEY are passionate about. Include that as a sidebar after the quote that highlights the influencer\u2019s profile.\n\nThen, consider paid, shared or other media to not only promote your post \u2014 but their take on their passion\u2026 You may end up with fodder for an entirely new blog post\u2026 Two different kinds of reasons to pay for promotion, and the influencer will be much more likely to share it\u2026\n\nThe most effective influencer marketing tip is twofold: (1) make it easy for them to show you support and (2) make something so valuable that they\u2019ll want to share it.\n\nFor the first tip, embrace the idea of sharing content that they can easily retweet or reshare on their own account. Give them easy \u201cclick to tweet\u201d links or a handful of images that they can use to promote the fact that they were on your podcast.\n\nFor the second tip, it comes down to making them understand and believe that this marketing effort is important. Once they think it\u2019s an important message or that the project that they\u2019ve been involved in is one that matters \u2014 You\u2019re gold.\n\nThe real influencers don\u2019t care if they\u2019re mentioned in a top 200 list. The real influencers want to be involved in something that tells their story in a meaningful and memorable way.\n\nWhen it comes to influencer marketing, I like to make sure I\u2019ve done the research and uncovered who influences the influencers I\u2019m trying to reach.\n\nGenerally, I\u2019ll find that it\u2019s actually easier to reach influencers through the people that they listen to or are friendly with. This typically means showing up on podcasts they listen to, or doing guest posts on blogs they may read. I\u2019ve also found that certain places that curate content can be a great way to reach the right type of influencers.\n\nThis is because influencers tend to have a lot of people directly trying to reach them. So if you can take an indirect approach and leverage social influence at the same time, you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting your message across.\n\nBy far, my top three influencer marketing tips for increasing exposure are to focus, focus, and focus. There is a natural tendency to want to be all things to all people, especially when your influence grows and more and more companies reach out to tap into that influence.\n\nThink of your personal brand as a bottle and your influence potential as fills the bottle. Let\u2019s call this your personal brand bottle. As your brand grows, it creates more space in the bottle to fill with more influence.\n\nWhen you grow a strong personal brand that focuses on your niche and communicates a consistent message, not only will your brand bottle grow in size, the quality of your influence will be purer. The stronger your brand story, the more influence your brand bottle will hold. If you lose focus on your brand story, your influence will start to leak out.\n\nReal (and authentic) exposure comes over time as more people are introduced to your brand bottle. Focusing on your core brand message and narrowing in on your content\u2019s target market is the most sustainable way to grow your exposure.\n\nSome people push for the biggest brand bottle they can by trying gain exposure through a wider market. Sure you might get followers and you might feel like your brand bottle is filling with influence. But is it really?\n\nWhen you spread yourself over multiple topics and areas of expertise, you dilute the concentration of your influence.\n\nWhen it comes to influencer marketing, bigger is not always better. What matters most is the influence you have inside of your brand bottle. The more focused the sphere of influence, the more influence you can have.\n\nThat makes you more marketable to companies who want you to bring light to products and services that cater to specific markets. Or on the flip side, if you are an executive or CEO who invests in building a brand bottle full with influence, you can use it to shine the light on your company\u2019s products and/or services. This drives awareness, trust, and ultimately more inbound leads for feeding bottom line growth.\n\nFocusing on focusing is one of the hardest things to do \u2014 SQUIRREL! SHINY OBJECT! \u2014 because there are squirrels and shiny objects trying to distract you everywhere.\n\nThe real riches are in the niches, so gain exposure by narrowing down the expertise that you want to be known for, and stay there. Dig in and master your trade. By doing so, you will build true influence \u2014 the kind that companies will pay you the big bucks to tap into.\n\nIt\u2019s not how big your brand bottle is, it\u2019s the quality of the influence you hold within it.\n\nBe kind, assist others, share your knowledge, and build a community around you of like minded people who \u201cget you\u201d and what you do. Be consistent and don\u2019t get involved in controversy. Stand out from the rest by sharing great content and keeping it positive and inspiring!\n\nThe next time you collaborate with an influencer, ask specifically for them to create more video content. This can be in the form of webinars, (which have worked particularly well for us at Mention) tutorials, product unveiling or reviews, behind the scenes, Q&As just to name a few.\n\nAlso, see what kind of video content they\u2019ve made in the past to get a feel for if they\u2019ll be a good fit for your brand. (Sandra Chung, Head of Content at Mention)\n\nBuild great relationships and be a giver to your influential relationships. The law of reciprocity will eventually pay itself back tenfold when you need help promotion something.\n\nTo increase exposure and establish ourselves as a reputable source for information, we reach out to subject matter experts for relationship building and to request interviews for creating our own unique, original content.\n\nFor success with influencer marketing, you\u2019ve got to know how to find the right influencers. Friend/Follower numbers are not the mark of a successful influencer, and most brands and agencies get that wrong.\n\nFinding the right influencers, with the right communities, who have the ability to compel that audience to action \u2014 that\u2019s an art. Both on the part of the person finding the influencer, and the influencer herself/himself.\n\nLastly, knowing how to craft the right kind of campaigns, with results that can be definitively measured, is critical. And again, something that doesn\u2019t happen very often.\n\nFrom a personal brand-building perspective, nothing beats live action video. The kind where we see you on camera. It is the closest thing we have to being there in person. It\u2019s the fastest way to build rapport, relationships and connection with your ideal audience.\n\nVideo also brings a legitimacy to your brand. People are checking you out. They\u2019re creeping you on Google. They want to see if you\u2019re the real deal. If when they reach your YouTube channel you have a minimum of say 15 videos there, it puts you in a different echelon of authority and influence.\n\nNot to mention that social media algorithms organically favor video and put your message in front of more people without having to spend a penny. Now that\u2019s pretty good deal.\n\nAs an influencer, I think one of the best and often underutilized strategies to increase exposure is through collaborations.\n\nYou have two choices: 1) You can build your audience and increase your exposure yourself, or you could 2) collaborate with other influencers and cross-promote each other.\n\nI\u2019ve personally found the 2nd option to be much easier and faster. You\u2019re basically borrowing the other persons credibility and leveraging their exposure, so that you can increase your own. It\u2019s about working smarter, not harder!\n\n#1. FIND THE RIGHT INFLUENCERS FOR YOUR BRAND\n\nIdentifying the right influencers can be the most difficult part of influencer marketing. Influencers essentially become an extension of your brand, which makes it crucial that they represent your brand\u2019s mission.\n\nResearch the influencers to make sure they will be a positive association with your brand and that the interests of their followers align with what you\u2019re promoting. Although the industries of fashion and beauty, health and fitness, food and beverage, consumer technology, and consumer packaged goods have an easier time identifying the right influencers, influencer marketing can work well for almost any industry, it might just require a little bit of more effort to find the right influencers and create the most effective messaging.\n\nMarketers are naturally attracted to statistics and often focus on influencers with larger follower counts, but smaller ones can easily outperform them when engagement is taken into consideration.\n\nEconsultancy found that 72% say relevancy is more important than reach, which solidifies the notion that context is key. Engagement rates and the type of engagement posts receive will determine if an influencer\u2019s followers will respond to what you\u2019re marketing. A massive following isn\u2019t as important as ensuring that the influencer is reaching your brand\u2019s target market.\n\nThe influencer has managed to accumulate their following for a reason, which makes it important that you give them complete creative control when it comes to promoting your product or service. Of course you need to be comfortable that the content they develop will respect and work within your brand\u2019s content guidelines.\n\nPromoting in the vein of an infomercial won\u2019t resonate with followers and will come off unauthentic. The influencer understands their followers better than anyone else and will know what will work and what won\u2019t. The more organic a promotion appears in a post, the better the followers will respond to it.\n\n#4. DON\u2019T JUST OPT FOR ONE MEGA-INFLUENCER\n\nMicro-influencers tend to have significantly more engaged followers, which makes securing multiple smaller influencers a better and more effective approach than having just one mega-influencer for the same price.\n\nOpting for one mega-influencer limits your marketing budget by concentrating all resources in one place. Covering more ground with more than one influencer will help you better understand your brand\u2019s most receptive audience.\n\nDepending on your budget and specific goals, working with one or multiple mega-influencers or celebrities might make sense for your brand, but there are many factors for you to consider prior to making that decision.\n\nInfluencer marketing can generate significant brand awareness, but it\u2019s important that you have more to offer when those potential consumers decide to look you up. When focusing on influence marketing, brands often neglect their other campaigns, which is a mistake.\n\nInfluencers should compliment your overall marketing because some followers might need further promotion or research prior to being sold on your product or service. An always-on influencer marketing strategy would also help as audiences will be exposed to more positive content about your brand from multiple sources over a period of time, increasing the likelihood of them purchasing your product or service.\n\nAdjustments may be necessary to get the most effective response from your campaign. Continually tracking metrics using various analytical tools will help you understand what changes need to be made in order to maximize the results of your influencer campaign.\n\nInfluencer marketing isn\u2019t just a one-step solution and should be treated as you would any other marketing campaign. Using influencers to market products or services can be a powerful tool, but attentive research and persevering effort are vital to ensure success.\n\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of signing up to a tool, posting an \u201cassignment\u201d, setting and forgetting. The resulting posts will end up looking contrived and inauthentic. It\u2019s important to build relationships online (with influencers and non-influencers alike) loooooonnnng before you ever need them.\n\nWhen you have a real relationship with people and they feel actual affinity to your brand, it will come across in anything they post. Invest the time.\n\nIf a person demonstrates passion and knowledge, they\u2019re much more likely to gain traction with people who share their interests and become influential in that respect. Everyone influences someone, so we all have a place to start.\n\nAnd from the start your comments, the links you share, and your conversations with connections all make an impact on the people who see them.\n\nCreating content about things I am passionate about, sharing, engaging, and building relationships is what has worked for me.\n\nThat influence may be subtle, but it may also be the thing that motivates a connection to check out a new brand, reconsider a business or pick up a new interest of their own. These little moments of influence help you extend form a network to a community, and community is one of the most important drivers of consumer habits. A Network Gives You Reach\u2026 But A Community Gives You Power!\n\nJust don\u2019t forget about those subtle, important moments of influence that everyone has the capacity for. Watch and listen to your audience, and others, closely for clues as to who influences them, what influences them, and how they engage and interact.\n\nIt\u2019s worth the effort to do some social sleuthing, so take a look at their conversations, personalities and interests, and start making connections. The more you do this, and the more conversations you have with the everyday people who influence small audiences, the better you\u2019ll get at understanding why they share and what they share.\n\nRelationships are like muscle tissue\u2026 the more they are engaged, the stronger and more valuable they become. #NoLetUp!\n\nBe sure to pinpoint the influencers you want to leverage carefully.\n\nMake sure their audiences include your ideal consumer or customer. Then begin following the influencers on their social channels and blogs.\n\nThen participate in conversations, share those posts you genuinely find helpful and add value with your own thoughts, ideas. If you can figure out what those influencers need help with, offer to help them out. Give value up front before ever asking for anything.\n\nNext, develop a round up post that solves a particular pain point for your audience and contact the influencers to asking them to participate. By following them and their content you\u2019ve already \u2018greased the skids\u2019 so you should get a fair number of positive responses.\n\nDraft the post and let them know when it is to be published. Thank them and ask them to help you evangelize it. More than likely, they will as it benefits them too.\n\nIntegrate non-text content from influencers to your content piece \u2014 making it more comprehensive than other similar content assets. Giving links to their pages (or embedding their rich media on your post) upfront can help encourage them linking to your content/site too, when you started promoting your rock-solid content to them.\n\nAs a LinkedIn Expert, I\u2019m always playing around with new features to see how we can use them in our Marketing and Lead Generation efforts. Native Video has become a real winner for us at Vengreso.\n\nWhen positioning oneself as an influencer, video can really help you take your content to the next level. It helps people to see who you are, and that you truly have expertise. Because (like all other social sites now) LinkedIn is giving more weight to native content in it\u2019s timelines, video is naturally going to get more visibility than sharing a YouTube link.\n\nA final strategy to amp up visibility is to create \u201csharing hubs\u201d (We use either email or LinkedIn Messaging) where you share the link of your video post with the group and amplify each other\u2019s content. Depending on who you have in the group, this can vastly increase visibility, (and align you with some pretty cool people!)\n\nIf you are (or want to be) an influencer, then get over your fear of video and jump on LinkedIn\u2019s latest platform. For more on how to best use LinkedIn Native video, sign into LinkedIn and go to LIVideoTips.\n\nBefore you begin any influencer campaign you have to learn that the power of influence is not how much you can carpet bomb the marketplace. If you are looking for mass media, pull out your checkbook and be prepared to spend a lot.\n\nInfluence is \u201cPULL\u201d not push. If you work with quality people producing quality content, your ROI will be 10x what you get with ads.\n\nIf you are looking for exposure, just buy ads. If you have an awesome story to share, care about the market, and are ready to listen to the conversation, influencer marketing will get you much better results.\n\nFor effective influencer marketing my most important recommendation is to aim at working with micro-influencers, those people who are not divas but are good at what they are doing and are unassuming. In that way, you will be able to co-create and spur mutual benefit for both parties."

        "text": "There\u2019s one task that I\u2019ve been known to avoid: going to the dentist.\n\nAnd it seems I\u2019m not alone.\n\nIn a 2015 UK study, visiting the dentist was #6 on a list of the top 10 most common activities that people procrastinate.\n\nIt makes perfect sense to me. Even a routine cleaning is uncomfortable, with all that scraping, suctioning and polishing. Unless you\u2019re in agony, it\u2019s so easy to put off the next appointment.\n\nHowever, the dentist\u2019s chair is one of the only things I avoid.\n\n12 years into building my company, JotForm, I can honestly say that I don\u2019t procrastinate anymore \u2014 and it\u2019s not because I have superhuman willpower.\n\nInstead, I\u2019ve developed systems and tactics that make it nearly impossible to delay what needs to be done.\n\nBefore we can beat procrastination, it\u2019s important to understand why we do it.\n\nAuthor James Clear explains that Greek philosophers including Socrates and Aristotle developed the word akrasia to describe the state of acting against your better judgment.\n\nIn modern terms, Clear says we all have a Present Self, which wants instant gratification, and a Future Self, which values long-term rewards:\n\nProcrastination often feels like self-sabotage. Your Present Self overrules your Future Self in order to get what it wants \u2014 right now.\n\nWhen I started my entrepreneurial journey, I made a conscious choice to play the long game. I bootstrapped the business and we grew slowly, from just a handful of users in 2006 to over 3.5 million today.\n\nI may not have understood the psychological tug-of-war between my Present and Future Self, but I did know that every small step adds up. I worked consistently and learned to manage my own procrastination triggers.\n\nNow that we have over 100 employees on two continents, we\u2019ve also created an anti-procrastination culture.\n\nAccording to our colleagues, consultants and customers (who I trust to tell us the truth), our team gets stuff done. We work quickly and effectively, without burning out in the process.\n\nWhile avoiding your tasks can have tough consequences, not all procrastination is created equal.\n\nIn a 2016 New York Times article, management and psychology professor Adam Grant shares an experiment conducted by a former student, Jihae Shin.\n\nShin suspected that procrastination can actually boost creativity, so she designed an experiment where participants develop new business ideas.\n\nWhen independent evaluators rated the business ideas, the procrastinators\u2019 plans were 28 percent more creative.\n\n\u201cWhen people played games before being told about the task, there was no increase in creativity,\u201d writes Grant. \u201cIt was only when they first learned about the task and then put it off that they considered more novel ideas. It turned out that procrastination encouraged divergent thinking.\u201d\n\nGrant points to Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, Frank Lloyd Wright and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin as examples of highly creative, accomplished thinkers who were (and are) chronic procrastinators.\n\nSo, how do you know the difference between a reasonable, creativity-inducing delay and destructive procrastination?\n\nIn an article for The Atlantic, author Derek Thompson says our emotions hold the key. He points to the work of psychology professor Joseph Ferrari, and explains that we procrastinate for two reasons:\n\nWe make familiar excuses, like \u201cI\u2019ll have this piece of pie now and work extra hard at the gym tomorrow.\u201d The cycle continues and we end up in \u201cThe Procrastination Doom Loop.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to differentiate between a healthy step back and classic avoidance, but I agree that it requires an emotional check-in.\n\nI like to ask myself and my team why we\u2019re waiting \u2014 to finish a task, make a decision, or tackle a problem \u2014 and if that delay will truly serve us.\n\nI\u2019m also a big proponent of stability. You can\u2019t dodge procrastination loopholes if you\u2019re always fighting fires, both in your work and your personal life.\n\nFor example, if the server is always going down, try to solve the root cause. Don\u2019t keep fixing the same issue. Create relaxed, repeatable and sane systems that actually support you.\n\nAt JotForm, our staff work in small, cross-functional teams. Every group is empowered to make and execute their own decisions. They have space and independence.\n\nWe also try to:\n\nUnanswered questions can lead to procrastination. Our 4\u20135-member teams all work on the same project, so they don\u2019t have to wait for someone else to give them a green light. They don\u2019t struggle to get everyone in the same room (and on the same page), either. The more answers you have, the easier it is to move forward.\n\nWhen we get stuck, we often use a technique called co-piloting. Two people will sit together at the same computer and talk the issue through. They share techniques and ideas. We also co-pilot in order to train new staff. Not only is it great for learning and pushing through blocks, but it prevents delays. Someone is literally watching you work, so you can\u2019t switch tasks or check out for a while.\n\nCut large projects down into small, manageable steps. You\u2019ll avoid bottlenecks and frustration, while enjoying the reward of consistent progress. Every little action helps to eliminate friction and move you closer to a finished state.\n\nWaiting kills productivity. It blocks team progress and drains excitement. We try to maintain a streamlined office that empowers people to take action. Very rarely do our staff need to get sign-off on their work. Instead, it\u2019s built in to our organizational and project structures.\n\nWe think unfinished tasks are the enemy. It\u2019s a philosophy I\u2019ve drawn from Lean Manufacturing philosophies and the Toyota Production System. For example, we encourage short throughputs (time from start to finish) and avoid having large \u201cinventories\u201d of leftover work. When one person starts a challenging process, other people can join the effort and push each other as a team. Together, you can finish just about anything.\n\nWhen an object is at rest, it\u2019s difficult to get it moving again. We all know the struggle to get off the couch and go to the gym. The same idea applies to teams. When your team has energy and productivity, it\u2019s easier to keep going. If the team is stuck, waiting for answers or motivation, it\u2019s difficult to re-start the engine. Stay in motion and you\u2019ll avoid productivity traps.\n\nWe have one rule for Friday demo days: you have to show your work on the live product. That motivates everyone to finish what they start. It also rewards real progress, no matter how small the task.\n\nOur daily team email lists all the open product bugs and shows who resolved the last ones. People want to see themselves on the \u201cfixed\u201d side. It\u2019s exciting to track improvements and it creates a sense of accountability. That keeps everyone on track.\n\nWhen I sit down at my desk, I don\u2019t do anything but work. I won\u2019t open Facebook or read a business article. It took many years to develop this mindset, but now it\u2019s an automatic response. I get to work and get right down to work. We also try to maintain a calm, productive office environment that promotes focus and flow.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of eating the frog. Tackling your most important or complicated task right away is an approach that really works. It\u2019s easier to think well when your brain is rested and you haven\u2019t slipped into decision fatigue.\n\nAn empty inbox makes me happy. Processing email isn\u2019t the most exciting part of my day, but I love that sense of accomplishment and control. Instant gratification feels good, but finishing what you set out to do feels even better \u2014 and I always try to remember that if I\u2019m tempted to procrastinate.\n\nArbitrary constraints can help you start, which is often the toughest phase of any task. If you\u2019re struggling to clean your home, for example, begin with one room. You may just keep going and finish the whole thing. Even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve created real momentum. Or, try the Pomodoro Technique, where you work uninterrupted for 25 minutes, then take a short break before logging another 25. The \u201cpomodoros\u201d quickly add up to create real progress.\n\nI always answer my oldest emails first. I never skip around. It forces me to tackle issues and questions right away, instead of saving them for later. You can also try the Seinfeld Strategy to develop an unbroken chain of daily effort."

What you had to learn. What you had to sacrifice.\n\nAll of this usually happens behind the scenes, and it\u2019s not visible to the naked eye.\n\nAnd the majority of people who are living on a stand-still simply don\u2019t get this.\n\nYou aren\u2019t better than them; you are just more developed.\n\nThe more things you accomplish in life, the more you evolve in the process, the more your perception of how the world works changes.\n\nThis makes even fewer people understand you. Which is the downside.\n\nThe upside, however, is that the few who do understand you \u2014 understand you better than anyone in life. That\u2019s because they had to go through the same process themselves.\n\nThese relationships are far more developed and closer, because they are so rare. They are founded on something so important for each individual \u2014 their life experience, and events that shaped them into a person they are today.\n\nAnd trust me here, there is nothing more valuable than this.\n\nI call it the greatest social luxury in the world.\n\nBefore you tell me that not everyone had a good starting point, or they were unlucky, know that you are reading this article from someone who spent his first 3\u20134 years of life, in an active war that was raging in Bosnia \u2014 and that was only the beginning of my journey.\n\nThere are genuinely no excuses.\n\nEveryone has their harsh reality.\n\nAnd that reality shouldn\u2019t be your excuse for the things that didn\u2019t work out.\n\nRight, misfortune happens to everyone, but you still have a choice where to go from there, and what lessons you will draw.\n\nAnyone who has ever achieved anything worth remembering, no matter what area you look at (art, music, entrepreneurship and so on), has done so by being their true self, despite the obstacles along the way.\n\nThey have persisted \u2014 no matter what."

How can the aqueous state of a the human be mimicked to a computational interface\n\n3) types of information states \u2013 currently computers process information in binary (0,1) format \u2013 qubits in quantum computing attempt to improve this; allow a system to superposition state of of simultaneous 0/1 states as well as state 0 or 1; can this be applied to a more flexible environment rather than a metal can provide\n\nIn March 2017, Dr. Yaniv Erlich and Dina Zielinski of Columbia University and the New York Genome Center published a method known as DNA Fountain which allows perfect retrieval of information from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA. (Wikipedia \u2013 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage)\n\nThe downside it currently costs $7000 to save the information and $2000 to retrieve it \u2013 does Moore\u2019s law still apply? If so we could reach a tipping point in only 28.5 years to reach a point where it costs a penny $0.01 per megabyte of information download \u2013 within our lifetime!\n\nLet\u2019s think about the progression of computer interfaces \u2013\n\n1950s we used wires switching on the back of a board\n\n1960s cards with holes in them\n\n1990s the internet able to search information in a flash\n\n2000s mobile phones to let us access information anywhere and anytime\n\n2010s headsets, watches and voice interface to speak a bit more naturally\n\n2020s\u2026 our minds to speak silently with a computer?

What this means is systems can learn and optimize to an outstanding level in areas where good and bad rules are set for them by a human \u2013 for example the game of go (AlphaGo) or understand nuances in images for health data (AlphaZero).\n\nComputers are becoming great assistants to us however they still need our thought to make good decisions.\n\nThe question I will end on for now is:"

        "title": "The Future is Now \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "On February 6, 2018, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, the largest ever, from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIts cargo was a Tesla Roadster, which is now orbiting the sun somewhere between Mars and the asteroid belt.\n\nBetween Elon Musk\u2019s numerous companies and passion projects (SpaceX, Tesla, Solar City, the Hyperloop, the Boring Company), and the quickly proceeding advances in VR/AR/MR, genetics/cloning, blockchain, AI, 3D printing, and other fields, someone who was in a coma since 1998 and just woke up yesterday would be forgiven for thinking they had jumped a hundred years into the future instead of a mere 20.\n\nBut then this person would actually get up and go out into the real world and see that mostly everything else is the same, aside from more traffic on the roads, more people in general, most of whom now carry miniature computers with them wherever they go that are more powerful than any desktop from the 20th century.\n\nBorn in apartheid-era South Africa, he lived the first 16 years of his life in various towns, including Pretoria, moving back and forth between divorced parents. He reports being bullied in school and witnessing a lot of violence. He tried sticking up for some other bullied children, but that generally resulted in more pain for him. Musk retreated somewhat into science fiction and fantasy, and the dreams he read on the page would come to inform the man he eventually became.\n\nHe moved first to Canada to live with some relatives, and later earned economics and physics degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to co-found Zip2 with one of his brothers, Kimbal Musk, and Greg Kouri, which was acquired for $340 million. Next, he co-founded X.com, which became Paypal and sold to EBay in 2002 for one and half billion dollars.\n\nNow very rich, Elon Musk turned his attention to those science fiction dreams.\n\nIn the short term: The environment has been poisoned at an ever-growing pace by the burning of fossil fuels for two centuries, beginning with coal and reaching a pollution peak as the massive population of China began using gasoline-guzzling automobile en masse. Musk\u2019s contribution to helping slow this is multi-sided: popularize electric cars by offering visually appealing, efficient and powerful versions of them with Tesla. Invest in more solar power adoption via Solar City. Open-source a plan for super-fast commuter train transport with the electromagnetic vacuum-tube Hyperloop project. Invest in tunneling technology that can help move this project along with the Boring Company.\n\nIn the long term: There have been dozens of small extinction events on Earth since the dawn of life, and several that have wiped out 75\u201395% of all living things. It will happen again, and there is a good chance that a large event will take with it the vast majority of humanity. Because of this, Musk founded SpaceX with an ultimate goal of turning humanity into a multi-planet species. He\u2019s funding this by creating reusable rockets that allow him to outbid competitors in taking cargo into orbit. The plan is to start a colony on Mars that will eventually be made self-sustaining. Ultimately, he thinks this can become home to a million people by roughly 2070.\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk wants to save us here and now, and also do what he can to save us for eternity.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with doing what you can to save people. Doctors, soldiers, first responders, they do this all the time.\n\nAnd, in general, our governments don\u2019t seem to be doing much to slow our pollution of the environment or protect us from future disasters. Yes, there has been some progress, but it is often mired in politics and red tape, and forward-thinking policies of one administration are often reversed by the following one. Our governments can barely protect us from rising sea levels and flu virii, let alone giant asteroid impacts.\n\nSo, someone has to do it. These grand efforts usually form around the resources of extremely wealthy individuals, and take many forms. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for instance, focuses on the physical and mental well being of the youngest and poorest people. Kimbal Musk, one of Elon\u2019s brothers, is using his fortune on a decidedly smaller scale in a quest to help reconnect us and our children in particular to a more natural, local and organic food culture.\n\nMany people who grew up in the early to mid 20th century thought we would be living in some kind of fairy-tale sci-fi wonderland by now. Others posited it would be a dystopia, or that all that would remain of our world would be a post apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nThe dreams and nightmares of our fictions have always pointed us to the truth of where we were headed. Echoes of George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Ayn Rand, Jules Verne, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, P. D. James, Arthur C. Clarke, and even Mary Shelley can be seen in our everyday lives. If we take what we have, examine the quickening rate of advancement, and extrapolate into the near future, we can easily believe that Ray Kurzweil\u2019s singularity is right around the corner. Artificial superintelligence, almost as soon as it realizes what it is, will proceed to surpass humanity in every way, leaving us behind.\n\nA super AI is one of the dangers Elon Musk sees as a potential extinction trigger, so it is likely his goals for a Mars colony will include keeping it rather well-separated in many ways from the civilizations of Earth. What good would his plan be, anyway, if he brought along to Mars the dangers that might doom us here on this planet?\n\nJust as with our development of atomic fusion, which led both to the horror of atomic warfare and (relatively) clean electrical power for millions, every significant innovation seems to carry with it both extreme positives and extreme negatives. If we want TNT to help greatly increase the building of infrastructure, we must accept it will be used to kill hundreds of thousands of people. If we want safer, cheaper workplaces via robotics, we must remove millions of potential jobs from the marketplace. If we want the convenience of smartphones, we must deal with the repercussions.\n\nOne of the late Dr. Stephen Hawking\u2019s common refrains was that the greatest threats to our existence come from the technologies that we\u2019ve devised. In essence, by forging ahead we may well become our own downfall.\n\nNewton\u2019s Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction. While this was meant to apply to the physical sciences, it has long since proven to be applicable in our daily lives.\n\nWhat, then, might this mean for the ambitions of Elon Musk? Might splitting the human race across two separate worlds eventually lead to some Solar System civil war that devastates humanity as much as any cosmic or earthbound natural disaster would have? Could gaining a truly massive foothold among consumers with solar and electric car technology upend economies founded on fossil fuels and lead to more war?\n\nThe odds, based on history, are in favor of something bad being caused by every good intention. But without those good intentions in the first place, virtually no progress would have been made by our civilization over the past 500 years.\n\nIf you removed every major instance of innovation by humankind since the discovery that we could control fire, we would be living on an Earth that looked incredibly different. \u201cWe\u201d wouldn\u2019t be here. Humanity would amount to a few million individuals at most, living in bands and tribes on plains, in forested river valleys, along coastlines.\n\nWe would be safer, as a species, only because we did not dare to dream. By dreaming, we discovered there are risks, but we continued, because there was always something to fix, something we could do better, somewhere else to go.\n\nElon Musk, and everyone who thinks like him, understands there are risks. In fact, they know that there will be some bad things, some complications, that arise because of their actions. But a choice had to be made between pressing onward versus sitting still, and they chose facing the darkness so that, at the very least, some light could be shed upon it.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing!\n\nIf you enjoyed this, please check out:\n\nDanger, Will Robinson!

        "title": "\u201cTake A Rest Day\u201d: 3 Reasons Why Not Working (Out) Works",
        "text": "I\u2019ve said it before; the Sports vs. Business comparison is a massive clich\u00e9, but it is endlessly applicable.\n\nThis week I discovered yet another level of applicability.\n\nAt an initial assessment with an athlete who is a new client at our performance consulting group, we reviewed his schedule, previous experience with training and coaches, his goals, and expectations.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of our mutual enthusiasm, he said:\n\nThis guy is not your typical \u201cNo Days Off\u201d Instagram bro. He\u2019s an internationally-competitive athlete with more trophies to his name than letters in the alphabet. Clearly he walks his talk!\n\nHowever, he came to our company because his performance was declining and he had suffered a few nagging injuries.\n\nWe went on to discuss his past training protocols; he explained that, even when he last coach prescribed a day off following a competition, he would still train. He had a compulsive need to always \u201cdo something\u201d.\n\nIf you have experience with physical training, you have probably heard that rest days are important to your exercise routine.\n\nIn fact, training actually breaks your body down and, when you are asleep or take a day off, your body heals itself from that damage until it can adapt to those stressors. That\u2019s why you get sore from squats one week and then two weeks later, in the same workout, you walk away unscathed.\n\nAfter a long period of not resting, one can experience injury, sleep disturbances, performance dips, and, in the extreme, burnout symptoms like depression or chronic pain.\n\nTo put it simply, we get stronger, more durable, and adaptable when we take a rest day.\n\nHere we go\u2026 the business comparison you were waiting for!\n\nIt\u2019s important to step away from work sometimes. Most 9\u20135 jobs allow people to leave the office when they punch out and then return to their responsibilities the next day.\n\nFor most of us involved with startups, we live at work.\n\nAnd when we\u2019re not \u201cworking\u201d, we\u2019re still working.\n\nIn my journey to finding out what it means to \u201cgo all in\u201d in the business world (we call it \u201coptimal performance\u201d in the sports world), I have unconsciously added in the Rest Day Rule.\n\nOne day per week or, maximum, every two weeks, I do my best to recreate my preferred relaxation environment. As a chronic over-thinker, my goal in this time is to purposefully allow my brain to momentarily switch off. Even if only for an hour or two.\n\nOn this day, I start off by shutting down my electronics, practicing relaxation techniques, and, usually, focusing on another part of my life outside work.\n\nPerhaps this is no surprise, but what usually happens in this time period is an overwhelming generation of fresh ideas, some sense of life balance, and a renewed desire to get back to work.\n\nInstead of my athlete making himself train on his rest days because it otherwise seems wasteful, I want him to want to train so he comes back tomorrow with new fire and fury.\n\nFor me at work, that \u201cI really need to complete *insert task here*\u201d becomes \u201cI really want to *insert task here*\u201d.\n\nI buy into the Rest Day Rule for business people. If you don\u2019t yet, here are three reasons why I hope you will give it a try.\n\nAlthough he appears hard on the grind 24/7, even Gary Vaynerchuk admits to taking weekends to spend time with his family and six weeks of holiday per year. Especially on vacation, he doesn\u2019t touch work or social media.\n\nBecause balance is important. Sleep is important. Organisation is important. Healthy habits, relationships, and a clean living space are important. They help us heal from our deficits and damages. They help us perform better.\n\nWhen you spend time with your partner or finally catch up on your favourite TV series or wash your car or go out to eat instead of ordering in like every other night of the week, you give yourself the freedom to think, feel, and experience outside of your work role.\n\nWhen we aren\u2019t deeply entrenched in the mundane, the routine, or the strategy, we suddenly realise what happens around us.\n\nYou may find yourself noticing brand new things that actually apply to business, such as how people behave or interact, what Facebook posts or Google Ads caught your attention, and how intriguing a headline was.\n\nAllowing yourself the space to break out of work mode brings you back to the real world, where real people function (and buy things) and real events occur (like conversations, conversions and attention).\n\nWhen you allow your focus to go somewhere else besides work from time to time, your attention can be more fully on work when you need it to be. You take the Working Days of the week more seriously and maximise each second of them, because you know reprieve is coming.\n\nThink about how miserable it would be to diet for 365 days per year. Not only is that unhealthy physically, but also mentally. When you know the diet will end, or when there\u2019s a cheat day at the end of the week, you\u2019re a little bit more okay with sticking to the rules (and staying out of the cookie jar) until then.\n\nYou become able \u2014 and willing! \u2014 to go 100% at work and 100% at rest.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t suddenly make you superhuman. You need a break.\n\nThere are times when the Rest Day Rule doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nWhen athletes compete at the Olympic Games or World Championships, they might not get a rest day. If they do, it\u2019s probably spent travelling, actively recovering, or otherwise, but they can\u2019t completely rest. It\u2019s not realistic until they\u2019re home again, and then they will probably go on vacation.\n\nThere are times in business as well when rest is too much of a luxury. Maybe you\u2019re fighting desperately to make payroll this month. Maybe you\u2019re travelling internationally this month with back-to-back meetings and flights through the night. Maybe, for any reason, you really just can\u2019t.\n\nThen do what my athletes would do and get some active recovery (\u201ctake a swim or jog\u201d). Go get a coffee, allow yourself three extra minutes to bring yourself back to earth, and fight on.\n\nAnd think about taking a vacation after."

        "title": "How to Choose the Right Mobile App Development Company to Build Your Dream App",
        "text": "So, you\u2019ve got a winning idea for a new mobile app that\u2019s going to change the world (and the funding to make it happen).\n\nBut, what do you do if you don\u2019t happen to have a team of UI/UX designers and mobile developers at your beck and call?\n\nIf time is of the essence, you\u2019ll probably start looking for an external mobile app development agency. The best mobile app development agencies possess extensive experience helping startups and have the specialized creative and technical talent to execute on your plans.\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you find the right agency you can trust to turn your million (or billion) dollar idea into a fully-realized mobile application.\n\nGenerally, app projects will fall into one of the following categories:\n\n1. End-to-end mobile app creation: some companies, especially startups and SMBs, want external help with every aspect of their mobile app: (1) strategy, (2) design, (3) development, and maybe even (4) post-launch marketing and maintenance.\n\nTIP: A common mistake occurs when clients needing end-to-end services choose an offshore development company that attempts to advise them on mobile strategy or help them execute on design. Because such companies often don\u2019t have the right personnel to offer these services, the result is often the stuff of nightmares, not to mention a huge waste of time and money. If you need end-to-end services, talk to a full-service mobile app agency that has dedicated specialists to perform such services. (LinkedIn is a great way to understand a company\u2019s org chart).\n\n2. Design & development: perhaps you\u2019ve already got extensive specifications documentation or a complete business plan. In this situation, you might just be looking for help to execute the UI/UX design and development of your app.\n\nTIP: Stay away from development companies that try to bundle design as an afterthought (often by tacking on a junior freelance designer), as UI/UX design requires specialized tools and approaches. An agency that offers UI/UX will often provide an Art Director and a UI/UX designer for your project. Try to use the same agency for both design and development when possible, as the collaboration between the two teams is critical \u2014 for example, to ensure that the UI/UX is created faithfully by the development team.\n\n3. Design only: perhaps you\u2019ve got a working prototype or MVP, but your design needs to be reworked. Or, maybe you or your partner is capable of handling development personally, so you only need to outsource the UI/UX design work.\n\nTIP: As with the previous example, make sure that the agencies you\u2019re considering have dedicated experts in UI/UX design and that they\u2019ve had successful design-only client engagements. Ask \u201cWhat are some examples of work you\u2019ve done for clients that were strictly UI/UX design-only projects, with no development?\u201d (If they can\u2019t answer, they\u2019re probably not right for your project.)\n\n4. Development only: if you\u2019ve already got the designs, great \u2014 you\u2019re that much closer to having your app created. You have more options here and can consider development companies that are nothing more than teams of overseas developers and a project manager, if you are on a shoestring budget.\n\nTIP: However, if you have little margin for error or are pressed for time (for example, if you face fierce competition in your category), I encourage you to look for a full-service mobile agency, as agencies typically do a more thorough job with Discovery (the process of identifying all relevant assets and requirements) as well as client communication. Both of these elements are critical to building a mobile app that reflects your vision. Working with overseas development-only companies can often seem like a black box and is often exacerbated by language barriers.\n\nWith more than 6,000 mobile app development companies worldwide (listed on Clutch.co), it\u2019s clearly a buyer\u2019s market. Use a reputable referral website like Clutch.co, whose ranking methodology considers verified customer reviews and Clutch analyst assessments of \u201cClients and Experience\u201d and \u201cMarket Presence.\u201d\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re in the Los Angeles area and want to look for a local partner, you\u2019d go here.\n\nUsing a referral site like Clutch.co, you can do several things:\n\n\u00b7 Review past client reviews, ensuring that an agency you\u2019re considering has multiple verified 5-star reviews for projects like yours. In general, you want to avoid companies that have even a few bad reviews (unless you like the idea of playing Russian Roulette).\n\n\u00b7 Make sure the listed budget ranges are \u201cin the ballpark.\u201d Do keep in mind that these are only suggested ranges, and that an agency might want to work on your project even if your budget falls below their listed range. This is especially the case if an agency: (1) believes in your mission, (2) is experiencing a temporary lull in business volumes, or (3) sees the potential for future opportunities with you down the road.\n\n\u00b7 Contact one or more companies that meet your criteria. This is only the beginning. (You certainly don\u2019t choose a mobile partner based solely on information online.)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made contact with a few potential partners, it\u2019s time to share your vision or plan with each:\n\n\u00b7 Begin with high-level discussions. If the fit feels right, move towards a more detailed Discovery process.\n\n\u00b7 If your business idea is sensitive or valuable from an intellectual property (IP) standpoint, ask for a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before you discuss your project in detail. When in doubt, execute an NDA.\n\n\u00b7 OPENLY share your documentation and plans once you\u2019ve got an NDA in place. This ensures that each company or agency can accurately assess the scope of work (SoW), decide whether it will bid on your project, and if so, craft an accurate proposal.\n\n\u00b7 If you hold back on critical aspects of your plan, you might initially be pleased with a lower project cost, but you could later face missed deadlines (which will infuriate your investors and shake their confidence), incur cost overruns, or risk your entire investment altogether.\n\n\u00b7 When possible, try to meet face-to-face. Not only will it foster a better working relationship should you choose to move forward with a given team, but you\u2019ll have a better read on their interest level and degree of fit.\n\nIt bears mentioning again: the best engagements begin with full transparency and a well-defined scope of work. (We\u2019re Discovery-heavy at CitrusBits, as this helps us ensure the highest-possible success rate for our clients.)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got estimates in hand, it\u2019s time to get critical.\n\nSome companies make decisions based solely on price at this juncture, because they assume that their earlier due diligence leaves price as the only remaining factor.\n\nHere are three other important considerations to go along with price:\n\n\u00b7 Timeline: If an agency bids the lowest but can\u2019t start for three months, your company will incur an opportunity cost (reduced \u201cspeed to market\u201d). On the other hand, if an agency bids the highest but can deliver your app four months ahead of the others, that constitutes added value in the form of increased \u201cspeed to market\u201d.\n\n\u00b7 Fit: The \u201cbest\u201d agency might not always be best for your project. Ask yourself whether each team really understands your vision for the app, has the right resources to deliver on it \u2014 and, importantly \u2014 is interested in your project as more than just a revenue opportunity.\n\n\u00b7 \u201cHidden\u201d details. Some of the most important considerations aren\u2019t on paper. Ask questions like:\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhat does the project team look like?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWho will the developers be? Are they full-time employees of your company? How long have they worked for you?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhat systems or tools do you use to do (X, Y, and Z)? Do you practice Agile or Waterfall methodology, or both?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhat are your thoughts on using (SYSTEM A) versus (SYSTEM B) for a project like ours?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWho would be our main point of contact? How often would we communicate?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhat do you think of my business plan? What would you change about it?\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWhat do you foresee as the two biggest challenges in working on my project?\u201d\n\nThe process of outsourcing your mobile application project might seem daunting when you consider all the moving pieces.\n\nThe companies you\u2019ve whittled your search down to are the best agencies for the job, have completed hundreds of successful mobile apps like yours, and are fully capable of doing exactly what you need, according to the timeline they\u2019ve agreed upon.\n\nStay positive and collaborative once the work is underway, and you\u2019ll soon get to experience the magical feeling that comes when you see your app become a reality."

        "text": "In a typical conversation, one person talks and the other person listens, but have most of us thought about HOW we listen?\n\nTalking is easy. We tend to gravitate toward talking about ourselves, and let\u2019s face it, we love talking more than listening. It\u2019s low effort, but the payout is big.\n\nListening is harder. Statistics show that only 10 percent of us listen effectively.\n\nDo we remember what the other person said before interjecting? Do we think of a reponse while they are talking?\n\nIf we do these things, chances are, we are so distracted by what is going on in our lives that we don\u2019t allow ourselves to really understand others and process what they are saying.\n\nI have been recently more conscious of the way I communicate.\n\nWhat have I been doing is along the lines of active listening. It\u2019s involving multiple senses through verbal and non-verbal messages, such as maintaining eye contact, nodding your head and smiling, agreeing by saying \u2018Yes\u2019 or simply \u2018Mmm hmm\u2019 to encourage people to continue talking.\n\nHere is what I learned by changing the way I listen:\n\nWe are so used to doing everything fast paced that our conversations suffer the same problem where we process our questions and responses on the spot.\n\nI have learned to take things slowly and be in the moment when talking to someone. I try to take in everything they say and process it because people want to be heard. I want to make people feel like their words are valuable because they are and there is always something to take away from them.\n\nI love helping people. I want them to know I am there for them and this is through listening. Being present allows me to support my friends and others when they want me to listen. This builds trust and support which trickles down to the interactions we have and the quality time we spend. You can apply this to other interactions, like at work, and it creates trust and accountability because people can count on you\n\nListening to people allows me to learn more about them and how I can help them. By concentrating on what someone is saying, it allows me to understand them better, whether they need support in a big event or when they don\u2019t feel comfortable about something.\n\nThe way someone is talking and what they are talking about can reveal a lot about themselves they might not even realize. In times of need, do what you can to fill in the gaps that can help them. Depending on the situation, listening deeply allows you to empathize with what a person is going through and allows you to provide the appropriate support that can benefit them.\n\nBy letting people speak without interruption or bias, you connect more with the other person by giving them space to express themselves. I have had deeper conversations by really taking in the other person\u2019s presence. Noticing their tone of voice, body language and mannerisms allow me to focus on how they are feeling when they are talking about something and it allows me to feel how they are feeling by mirroring my senses to theirs. This makes me more alert to what is being said and allows me to connect the dots of what they are saying to my life.\n\nWhen we think of responses while the other person is talking, we can perpetuate our existing biases to a conversation. If both people do this, this doesn\u2019t give anyone a chance to think about differing point of views. We don\u2019t really gain anything from the conversation besides pushing our thoughts and beliefs onto each other. Sure, we might be eliciting emotions but are we generating understanding that isn\u2019t rooted from our own bias of a situation?\n\nActive listening has allowed me to understand the other person\u2019s point of view without incorporating my own opinions or feelings. This allows me to concentrate on what they are saying while considering different aspects, such as where they come from, their upbringing, and so forth.\n\nI don\u2019t immediately jump to talk about feelings, but how what they are saying connects to different points of their life, and trying to understand and what influences them, how they make decisions, where they are coming from.\n\nThe surprising point was that when I intently listened to people while they were talking, they intently listened to me.\n\nRecently I had a conversation with a friend I met for the first time and we talked for 11 hours. This was because along with having similar experiences and life goals, we gave our full attention to listening when one person was talking.\n\nResearch has found that active listening helps us focus on understanding others and also improves our relationships by promoting trust, reducing conflict, and increasing our ability to motivate and inspire those with whom we\u2019re communicating. Listening to people\u2019s stories, along with sharing our own, can prompt us to put our attention into another person\u2019s world, which cultivates connection. (1)\n\nWhen we show people that we are interested in hearing them speak, the person speaking will usually feel more at ease and therefore communicate more easily, openly and honestly. These behaviors can be mirrored which allows both people to have a fulfilling conversation.\n\nBy actively listening to other people, I learn from them. I have learned new skills that I can apply to my own life. People\u2019s stories or mistakes have inspired me to evaluate myself by thinking about the kind of person I am now and who I want to become. This happens regardless of the person I talk to, making me more open to meeting new people.\n\nActive listening can turn seemingly useless conversations into life lessons that allow you to understand people and how you can help them. Through active listening, we can understand things just a little better and realize that everyone offers perspective that can shape your life.\n\nCheck out my Skillshare Course on UX research and learn something new!\n\nTo help you get started on owning your design career, here are some amazing tools from Rookieup, a site I used to get mentorship from senior designers:\n\nLinks to some other cool reads:"

        "text": "More startups are meeting success through crowdfunding\n\nBecause of the success rates, many businesses are now being drawn into launching their ideas through crowdfunding. Now, even accelerator/incubator companies are seeing the good in crowdfunding, and they are looking to expand their ventures to put more emphasis on capital forming through backers.\n\nEquity crowdfunding and crowdfunding, in general, have been effective so far. According to Crowd Crux , 60 percent of campaigns were launched into a business within a year or less. The success of crowdfunding campaigns depends on them reaching their goals.\n\nA common method that many startups use to raise funds nowadays is through equity crowdfunding. Compared to general crowdfunding, the new practice introduced in the Jobs Act of 2012, makes equity crowdfunding more of an investment platform. Through equity crowdfunding, investors and venture capitalists get returns for placing funds in a startup. This draws in more investors to a particular startup.\n\nIdeas will serve as the backbone of any company or business venture, but what will jumpstart it is always the capital. Without a significant capital injection, startups will be unable to make the right business decisions to get their ideas moving forward. Startups are always looking for ways to meet their initial funding needs. Lucky for them, there are various ways to raise capital, one of which is crowdfunding.\n\ntruCrowd, Inc., the owner and operator of Regulation CF crowdfunding portal truCrowd.com, recently announced that they have signed an agreement with Digital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTCMKTS:DATI). The deal allows Digital Arts Media Network to purchase up to 39.89 percent stake in truCrowd.\n\nThrough the deal, DATI is looking to expand its capital formation programs with the help of truCrowd. Vincent Petrescu, President of truCrowd, Inc., says that with the recent agreement they have struck with Digital Media Arts Network, they will be able to \u201csupport traditional capital formation and Reg CF compliant blockchain related projects.\u201d\n\nAjene Watson, Digital Media Arts Network, CEO says that the crowdfunding portal will give them access to a framework that will help out early-stage companies even more. In the coming months, the accelerator company could soon reveal the fruits of labor from its deal with truCrowd.\n\nNow that Digital Arts Media Network shares a stake at truCrowd, it could improve upon its already effective PAI structure to help startups gain more ground. Through the PAI business model, startups are able to accrue more capital by giving investors a deal that they\u2019ll certainly find fair.\n\nThe company partners with highly vetted startups to help them out on their early-stage in their respective sectors. Digital Media Arts Network guides these companies through a program they call as \u201cpath of accuracy.\u201d With this and their expansion into crowdfunding, the partners of the company could see tremendous growth.\n\nCompared to other investing platforms, the PAI model gives investors access to liquidity in as early as two years. The standard time for assets to reach liquidity is usually around 10 years, and this long waiting period is one of the reasons why venture capitalists aren\u2019t always willing to invest in startups.\n\nCrowdfunding is growing in popularity, and we can thank it for the success of startups that are looking to revolutionize sectors. The expansion of certain accelerator companies into crowdfunding comes in good timing too, as promising blockchain startups are also popping up left and right."

        "text": "All day you\u2019ve been coming up with excuses and thinking of how you could back out.\n\nIt\u2019s still not too late, you can turn back now. You\u2019re just not feeling up to it today.\n\nYou can always make up for it by working a bit harder\u2026 later.\n\nMaybe something will come up last minute and you won\u2019t have to go through with it in the end.\n\nNo, no, you\u2019ve come this far, just do it and get it over with. It won\u2019t be as bad as you think and it will be over before you know it.\n\nAnd then just like that, it\u2019s all over.\n\nYou made it through and you couldn\u2019t be happier that you stuck with it.\n\nThis is what it feels like to overcome yourself and all of the obstacles around you to achieve success.\n\nI\u2019m sure that everyone has had dialogues just like this one before many important moments in their life: job interviews, public speaking, having an uncomfortable but necessary conversation.\n\nBut actually, this is the conversation that I have had with myself every other day for the past 15 years about going to the gym. And what I\u2019ve found, is that going to the gym is not only training for your body, it is great training for your mind to overcome the challenges we face in achieving success.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a big fitness enthusiast since I was a teenager. I was playing lots of different sports and would go to the gym and read up on different workouts and diets to try to get an edge on the playing field.\n\nWhen you are underneath a bar filled with heavy weights, there is a fear inside of you of what will happen if you are not able to lift it. Or when you are about to do some high intensity running you are worried if you will be able to make it without throwing up.\n\nThen there is the actual physical discomfort that comes from the lifts or from being out of breath to the point of feeling nauseous. Where you want to quit and call it a day, but force yourself to keep going until you reach your target.\n\nAnd even if overcome all of these physical challenges, there\u2019s the boredom from doing the same movements over and over again. Trying to do things just a little bit better or a little bit faster than last time.\n\nAll in all, working out is tough and it leads to anxiety before you ever step into the gym. You think throughout the day of all the different ways you can get out of it and try to rationalize how you can skip the gym today.\n\nWorking out is constantly training your mind to overcome obstacles. And every time you go to the gym and you make it through to the end, you are proving to yourself that you can do the things that you set out to do.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve also learned from years of working out regularly, is that the most important factor to achieving your goals is consistency.\n\nMany people starting out try to do way to much, way too quickly and burn out because the effort required is unsustainable. Or they get discouraged when they don\u2019t see immediate progress and decide it\u2019s not worth the effort to keep going.\n\nSound familiar? The obstacles that you face in achieving your fitness goals are smaller scale versions of the obstacles you face in life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be complicated: it is all about consistency. Fitness is all about showing up at the gym on the days that you don\u2019t want to go, over and over again.\n\nIf you want to become a better writer, it\u2019s about sitting down and writing every day, even if you don\u2019t feel like it.\n\nOr if you want to sell more of your product, it\u2019s getting on the phone or speaking to people even if you know you will be rejected most of the time.\n\nAnd if you need any proof that you can do all of these things, just go for a workout and see how you feel before and after."

        "text": "2 Strategies To Win The Day, Every Single Time\n\nHere are a few things I\u2019ve seen with passionate people. Whatever they\u2019re working on, a book they\u2019re writing, a startup they\u2019re building, a career they\u2019re invested in \u2014 they associate the ups and downs of it with their own happiness and fulfillment.\n\nOf course this is almost always going to happen; this is your passion after all. But here\u2019s the truth. If this thing is the only thing you have, you\u2019re leaving yourself unbelievably vulnerable to the inevitable troughs of your adventure.\n\nIf this is the only thing you have, you\u2019re going to be high as a kite during good times and as low as the Titanic when things aren\u2019t so great. Not only is this extremely taxing on your mental health, but it\u2019s also just a poor strategy for the lifetime of your project (and life in general).\n\nYou pitched 6 investors today and they all said no. Your business is the only thing you\u2019re working on. This day didn\u2019t go so well because your business didn\u2019t go so well. You feel bad.\n\nThis other person also pitched 6 investors today and unfortunately, the investors also said no. This person also went to the gym that day and increased their squat. They then cooked a new recipe for the first time and didn\u2019t mess it up. This person won the day.\n\nThe key is to not exclusively bind your self worth to your work. Having other things, small things, almost negligible to the untrained eye \u2014 will be how you win the day.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely easy to get caught up in the \u2018main thing\u2019 but having pet projects, fitness goals and learning goals that you can pursue concurrently, will be your life line during the low points.\n\nHad a meeting with some stakeholders that went sour? Go extra hard on your run and beat your best time. Win the day.\n\nDrew a creative blank for 6 hours? Extend your daily meditation, and add a few extra chapters of reading for the day. Win the day.\n\nThe unsolvable problems of today can be left for tomorrow without you having to feel guilt or mental fatigue."

        "text": "Unlike many Data Scientists, I don\u2019t have a PhD in Math, Statistics or Computer Science, I don\u2019t even have a PhD for that matter. I believe that is the main reason why I don\u2019t get stuck on complex algorithms and endlessly debate about which one of them would potentially solve a problem, as I see so many Data Scientist do. I tend to look at things from a business perspective and focus on what the desired outcome has to be, before diving into a pile of data and figuring out what type of algorithms could solve my problem.\n\nFrom a very young age I was always entrepreneurial, from starting a gardening service in my neighborhood, washing cars or selling post stamps door-to-door. But unlike most of the great entrepreneurial stories you hear, I didn\u2019t flip that into a multi-million dollar enterprise, most of my endeavours\u2019 were very specific and short-term. Anything from wanting to buy candy, a new bike or some new clothes. Luckily as I continue to get older, I realized that delaying gratification is much more rewarding both professionally and financially.\n\nBut in my work understanding the big picture and being able to break it down in to smaller short term objectives has served me well. This is why I am stunned at so my companies, who want to be seen as the most innovative company, a disrupter, but don\u2019t understand that to be truly disruptive you don\u2019t have to re-invent the wheel.\n\nLike most people I love innovation, in the past I would have been one of the people waiting in line or pre-ordering the latest game console, smartphone or wearable, lately I tend to be a little bit more skeptical about what is considered innovation and what is in essence repurposing an old idea to a new scenario/industry/process.\n\nWhen Apple came out with the Apple-I, it created a truly innovative product, which led to competition from IBM, Compaq and later Dell, who didn\u2019t necessarily innovated but focused on developing more effective and cheaper approaches to produce personal computers for the masses.\n\nWithin my field of expertise, Payments, I am experiencing the same thing. Companies who are claiming to be extremely innovative, but are essentially only increasing the effectiveness of the process.\n\nTo give an example, today there are over 900 different Payment Service Providers, each one of them provides merchants with the ability to process transactions over the rails of card networks like Mastercard, Visa, JCB, Diners/Discover and UnionPay. Rather than focussing on finding a new way to exchange value among merchants and consumers, PSPs focus on expanding connectivity and capabilities and call it innovation. Integrating with hundreds of Alternative Payment Methods, or reducing friction by building multiple parts of the Payments Value Chain into one platform, is very challenging and provides significant value to global merchants, but it isn\u2019t until the majority of PSPs understand that processing payments is a commodity, they will start to explore how to innovate to create actual value.\n\nSidenote: You might be thinking, but isn\u2019t that what Cryptocurrency is doing, and you are right, but unlike the large card networks, Cryptocurrencies sit outside of what the world as a whole considers monetary value. So until Cryptocurrencies are considered a globally accepted currency, like the Euro, the Dollar or the British Pound, I tend to leave them out of my analysis. That does not mean that I don\u2019t believe that the technologies that are powering the Cryptocurrencies, hold the most potential truly disrupt the global economic system.\n\nAs I discussed in previous post, I believe that the opportunity in the Payments space and every other industry that relies on technology, is to add-value through the usage of Data.\n\nBesides trying to change the technology or increase the effectiveness of a process, companies should also be focussing on how they can leverage the data in their possession and use non-industry related concepts and algorithms to provide real value to their customers by showing them insights, optimizing performance and reducing costs.\n\nOf course there are many more applications for data, but when you are just trying to figure out, how you can leverage the data that you have, finding insights, optimizing performance and reducing costs are the three things that are easiest to achieve and have a great positive impact on the business.\n\nNo matter the industry that you are in, retail, transportation, financial services or any other, the one question that continues to come up is: \u201cWhat do we know, that our customer, competitor or supplier does not know?\u201d. The question might be asked in a ton of different ways, but it always comes down to the insights that you have that others don\u2019t and how you can benefit from it.\n\nIn Retail, if you know what kind of clothing your shoppers have bought in the past, you can make better estimations on what to buy for the upcoming season. In Transportation, if you know during which times there is increased traffic on certain roads, you can suggest alternative instructions to your drivers to reduce the travel time. In Financial Services, if you understand the spending habits of your clients, you are able to provide them with offers for credit cards that could help them earn rewards for when they travel abroad or at specific retailers.\n\nBeing able to use the data that you have in your possession and provide your employees with Business Intelligence to make evidence-based decisions as well as customers with insights into their interaction with your company, is the first step in providing value and enhancing your overall product/service.\n\nLooking at platforms like Google Analytics or Kiss Metrics, we see how getting insights from data can help us to make better decisions over time. Even better when we can use the insights to automate the decisions we make somewhere else, like for instance which ads to run and based on what keywords.\n\nBy repurposing these same ideas, we could improve the way we look at data across all industries. Retail could use a combination of sensors, motion and register data, to track the number of people walking into a location, the way shoppers move through the store and eventually how many end up buying something. This would not be very different from the way Google Analytics uses clickstream data to track how shoppers interact on your website and connecting it with e-commerce checkout data to determine which shoppers actual end up buying something.\n\nAnother way of leveraging the data that is generated within your company, is to improve the performance of your product. Especially in Technology, the number one reason for companies to become obsolete, is because they build something that solved a problem better than a previous incumbent, but haven\u2019t reinvested in improving the product ever since. As more customers were using the product, they have worked on ensuring that the process is as efficient as possible, but making actual adjustments has become to big of a risk.\n\nUnlike Insights, Optimizing Performance should not be an analysis process but an automated process through the use of algorithms. By determining the Key Performance Indicators (KPI\u2019s)that are crucial for the company, creating processes to optimize for those KPI\u2019s should be the next step after building Business Intelligence.\n\nIn Transportation, especially in the delivery of perishables every unnecessary minute spend out on the road instead of in a warehouse or at the grocery store, should be eliminated. So let\u2019s imagine a truck driver who has to deliver goods to five different locations. Instead of going down a random list, we would use an algorithm to calculate the shortest path, based on the distance/time.\n\nIn a perfect world there would never be a problem and this calculation would be done once and never has to be done again. But with changing weather conditions, traffic and road work, the path needs to be recalculated every single time to ensure that the route chosen is the best one. By using historical data as well as third-party data, an algorithm could optimize the performance for every delivery to ensure that each day the best route is chosen.\n\nAnother often overlooked way to leverage data is to reduce cost, the reason it is mostly overlooked is because the resources and time spend on trying to save 1% are much rather used on trying to increase sales or revenues. But especially in the Financial Services industry, reducing costs has been a very big focus point since the rise of FinTech and the unbundling of the banking industry.\n\nChallenger banks are reducing the cost of maintaining a bank account, because they don\u2019t need expensive retail locations. Payments companies are dealing with increased competitions and Full-Stack PSPs, who can operate on thinner margins by integrating multiple parts of the value chain. And even Lending has had to deal with Alternative Lending companies who reduce the risk and fees by using crowd-funding and being fully digital.\n\nSo where Business Intelligence provides companies with insight into the underlying trends of the business, and algorithms help to improve operational performance, joining the two together and quantifying the impact in the cost reduction is what provides value to both the company and it\u2019s clients.\n\nIn Payments processing transactions is more frequently done through multiple Acquirers, who each maintain a different pricing structure. By tracking the performance of each connection and the cost associated to it, PSPs could leverage the insight to help their merchants route transactions to the best performing or lowest priced route.\n\nWhenever we think about great innovator\u2019s like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, we tend to believe they are constantly shooting for the moon, which couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Like a Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, The Wright Brothers, Alan Turing or Tim Berners-Lee, true innovation is not about the giant leap, but about the small steps accumulated which nobody sees that compounded shift a paradigm.\n\nBy focusing on the low hanging fruits by creating better insights for your employees/colleagues, using state-of-the-art technologies to implement algorithms that optimize performance and by reducing costs as well as improve the underlying processes, companies can make those small steps that over a period of many years compounded look like great innovation."

        "title": "How most teams f*ck up their feedback culture \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "I hold a firm belief that people try to do their very best with what they know.\n\nOther than a very small percentage of genuine psychopaths that find their way into workplaces, the overwhelming percentage of people you work with want to do a good days work, alongside good people, belonging to a good workplace culture.\n\nAnd yet, we still find ourselves referring to the abysmal state of workplace engagement. Gallup reports a staggering 87% of people aren\u2019t engaged in their work. Sheesh. Nearly 9 in 10. And climbing.\n\nSo where does the intent of good (good work, good people, good culture) go? How does good turn into to bad?\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a raft of variables that contribute to the malaise, including poorly chosen motivation structures, mountainous layers of bureaucracy and non-existent role clarity, but I\u2019m going to suggest one trumps all others.\n\nNot that big daddy. An even bigger one.\n\nIf we sit and drew up a list, we could genuinely count just a handful of teams and hardly any organisations who do feedback well. But there are a few rare ones. Hard to find, but they\u2019re out there.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these same teams are without doubt the most engaged, most productive and most innovative teams I have worked with. In short, they are superstars on almost every measurement. Because they dug in. They did the work where it counted. They \u2018got\u2019 feedback.\n\nSo where do most teams get feedback wrong? Glad you asked.\n\nThere\u2019s two key areas where most teams, albeit with the best of intentions, don\u2019t just fall a little short, but are way off track.\n\n*and never will, because it\u2019s off-kilter.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a stroll into the first key area around what feedback actually is. But first, be warned, this may sting a little.\n\nMost people like the concept or ideal of feedback, but won\u2019t commit to the practice of it. Truth.\n\nWe say we\u2019re looking to improve ourselves through feedback but we\u2019re actually much more interested in strengthening our confirmation bias than wading through the tough work (toughest work) of what feedback actually is;\n\nAn exchange that results in sustainable or improved outcomes.\n\nAnd yet, most aren\u2019t seeking this at all. They are after justification or vilification through confirmation rather than a true exploration. Geez that\u2019s a lot of \u2018ations, isn\u2019t it?!\n\nConfirmation bias is arguably our most prevalent, and certainly most studied cognitive bias we know. In simple terms, it\u2019s where we seek information to consolidate a pre-existing worldview or opinion we have on something.\n\nIn the pursuit of feedback, most people carry one of two beliefs they then seek to use feedback to reinforce;\n\na) I\u2019m awesome and everything I do is top shelf, or\n\nb) I\u2019m hopeless and everything I do is rubbish.\n\nSo if say, Tina decides she wants feedback on a project, yet all she is doing is using it as a vehicle to confirm her existing belief system, then we\u2019ll see her filtering the information (no matter how well crafted) through one of those beliefs. Her boss might be challenging her to improve, say, her design thinking, but rather than stay focused on the opportunity for improvement, she\u2019ll process the information into less helpful areas.\n\nTo do feedback really well is to embrace a worldview that everything is adjustable. That nothing is as bad or good as it seems\u2026it just is.\n\nRather than get obsessed with trying to justify or confirm your pre-existing thinking, get obsessed about life improvement. If you bring that filter to the table, then your ability to give and receive feedback is eminently improved straight away.\n\nSo let\u2019s now move onto the mechanics of feedback\u2014or at least the broken parts of a big machine.\n\nThe second key area where feedback fails (far too often) is by leaders and teams employing underperforming structures and processes to paper cache over the rampant confirmation bias that we haven\u2019t dealt with.\n\nLet me run through a few common ones that are cleverly sold by consultants and app makers, but contribute to the larger problem.\n\nThere should be a 12 step group for leaders, HR and OD practitioners. Meetings would start with something like.\n\nHi, I\u2019m Kevin and it\u2019s been 90 days since i last used a suggestion box and I\u2019m thinking about ending our subscription to the Wah-wah Pulse-check survey (polite applause ensues)\n\nMy first 90 days hasn\u2019t been easy. The first step was admitting I was powerless when using anonymity, and that our feedback culture had become unmanageable.\n\nLook, if I didn\u2019t have to worry about a semblance of word-count decorum, I\u2019d spend the next 10,000 words painting a picture why anonymous feedback is like putting a band-aid on cancer.\n\nSo i\u2019ll make it brief. The cornerstone of feedback is a conversation. That requires two or more people. Being grown ups. Engaging with each other. \u2018But people are too afraid to speak up\u2019 you might cry. Then I\u2019d suggest the only person in this situation that lacks courage is the HR crew who won\u2019t take action. Whether it\u2019s a pulse check survey, 360 degree exercise or wider engagement surveys conducted through anonymity, I\u2019d suggest you\u2019re better off without them and the sooner you dig in for the tough road of building an open feedback culture, the better off you\u2019ll be.\n\nAgain, going against the very nature of how feedback (a series of conversations designed to produce adjustments in behaviour) far too many people try to have less conversations, and do them super-well. We design flashy performance management frameworks and systems, drop a bunch of cash on feedback apps to rate each other, or set up two-hour long agendas to work our way through so nothing is left to chance. And it doesn\u2019t work. Why?\n\nBecause feedback works best when it\u2019s a continual conversation rather than an intermittent one. Understand this;\n\nBut when we\u2019re fearful or lacking confidence in handling a situation we can tend to default to process, but it ignores a driving principle in good feedback cultures.\n\nFrequency trumps quality. Yep. Smaller, imperfect yet regular conversations are how we build trust. It shortens the feedback loop and allows us to be more agile and figure out where we\u2019re not aligning and where we\u2019re getting it right. Think about it. The deepest, most trusted relationships in your life were constructed around lots of small conversations with plenty of ups and downs. You didn\u2019t get married and agree to just have a monthly status report where you\u2019d table all the things that annoyed you about your relationship did you? You worked it through. You took the time. And sadly, for those who didn\u2019t they joined the statistics of marriages that failed.\n\nThe last structure we see that is rife in many workplaces again, seems well intended but invariably leads to greater pain than it tries to solve.\n\nSeems fair enough right? Don\u2019t go off half-cocked. Document. Prepare your case. Then present it to them. This is the oft-delivered advice from HR practitioners the world around, scarred by too many industrial relations claims. But it\u2019s deeply flawed.\n\nY\u2019see when someone (in most cases a boss) prepares evidence it removes the most valuable foundations that great feedback cultures are built upon.\n\nThe teams that are best at feedback don\u2019t \u2018save it up\u2019 or stockpile it for the perfect moment. They have it regularly and in real time. Not only does it remove our ability to be agile in feedback, it also makes one party feel well prepared and the other party conspired against. Not the ideal environment for a open feedback session, would you agree?\n\nSo ditch the copious note taking between feedback sessions. You don\u2019t need to build a case, you need to build regularity. It\u2019s the hallmark of the best."

But instead, What can I do to prevent those things from occurring in the first place?\n\nBecause no matter how mentally tough we are, and no matter how many resources and supports we have, it\u2019s just really hard to pull out of negative spirals once we\u2019ve fallen into them:"

I am going to choose myself and start an entrepreneurial journey.\n\nNot really. I\u2019m now five months in unemployment and I haven\u2019t made a single dollar. I have tried a couple of ventures and nothing stuck. I tried freelancing and consulting. They\u2019re both service oriented and now I\u2019m shifting into building a product.\n\nI was never a kid with entrepreneurial potential. I don\u2019t have stories of selling lemonade in the streets or reselling toys to my classmates.\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve set foot in business and I\u2019m a total beginner. In summary, I\u2019m an employee for my whole life \u2014 taking orders and doing them well.\n\nMost of us quit our jobs because we feel trapped. And once we start creating our own business, we create our own shackles.\n\nRecently, I read the book E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber because Tim Ferriss heavily recommends it. This book reveals a set of problems faced by new business people. Once you understand the three archetypes, you will see your startup as a group effort.\n\nHere are the three archetypes you need for your startup.\n\nThis represents the majority of people. If you get your hands dirty in your work, then this represents you. These are the people who execute.\n\nThey\u2019re the ones baking the pie, designing products, or hammering nails.\n\nWhen technicians build their business, they concentrate on getting work done. It\u2019s about having results and working as many hours as they can. The technician\u2019s primary resource is time. His work is directly correlated with the time that he puts in.\n\nThese people pride themselves on the sweat equity that they put in the business.\n\nThese people thrive on organizing and cleaning up the mess. They create systems and process that streamlines the company.\n\nThey are responsible for aligning everyone and making sure everyone has the right information about a project.\n\nThey deal with bookkeeping, filing your taxes, and legal compliances of your corporation. These things are necessary but don\u2019t directly correlate to making a profit. But you still need to figure these things out.\n\nThis person holds the vision for the company. His main job is to make a mess and create a ruckus.\n\nThis is the troublemaker and rebel. He wants to reach for the moon and has an endless ball of energy to inspire everyone with his dreams.\n\nHe\u2019s the captain of the ship.\n\nThey are generals who watch the war from an eagle\u2019s vantage point. They are not in deep waters and they have an objective eye to every situation."

After all, one of them seems to exclude the other.\n\nAgain, you are asking the wrong question. It is not about choosing which one of the two you should be doing. The real question you should ask yourself is this one:\n\n\u201cIn which order should I be doing them?\u201d\n\nCreation happens through intermittent cycles of experimentation and focus.\n\nExperimentation lies at the beginning of the process. In this stage, you are testing different assumptions, until you find an idea, for which evidence shows that it is viable.\n\nOnce you have done that, you focus on the execution of that idea.\n\nHere, focus becomes the key. You are throwing everything you\u2019ve got onto this idea, until you have collected enough feedback, to make a viable decision about where to take this project next.\n\nFeedback might tell you to change directions.\n\nOr, it might tell you to just keep going.\n\nWhen you find out that you have to change directions, then you re-enter the stage of experimentation. You make slight changes to your idea and see what customer responses are telling you.\n\nOnce you find a way that seems to be working, you put everything onto its execution once again.\n\nYou keep going through these cycles, until your project is completed."

        "title": "Block Chain Technology is ready to restructure the Health Care Industry",
        "text": "3rd Year, B.Tech, Department of Polymer Science and Technology, University of Calcutta\n\nIts heady days in the blockchain world thanks the meteoric rise of bit coin \u2014 news of fortunes made and lost have been splashed across front page newspapers for months. But the public is also starting to understand that block chain\u2019s potential is far, far greater than just helping savvy crypto investors get rich.\n\nA new way to do more than just manage data.\n\nBlockchain provides many industries with a totally new way to store and manage data, and thus stands poised to revolutionize those industries, and in turn, the world, much like Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line suddenly and absolutely transformed automobiles, and consequently, our entire society.\n\nIs blockchain more disruptive than healthcare?\n\nPossibly no industry faces greater disruption from blockchain than healthcare. This industry represents a huge portion of the economy \u2014 Services predict that healthcare spending will cover nearly 20 percent of the U.S. national economy by 2025. And of course, this sector has a very real effect on the average person\u2019s quality of life. How could blockchain be leveraged to disrupt and improve the healthcare industry over the next few years?\n\nThe days of doctor\u2019s offices keeping massive file rooms with a paper folder for every patient are long gone. Electronic medical record keeping systems have been adopted by 96 percent of hospitals, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\nThese record systems essentially replicate the paper folders that came before, allowing doctors to record health information across patient visits and easily search for different factors in a patient\u2019s health history. But EMR systems still have a major problem: they are often incompatible and institution-specific.\n\nThe MIT Technology Review recently reported that there are 26 different EMR systems used across hospitals and providers in Boston, each representing data differently. These compatibility issues are inconvenient, of course, but they also can stifle information flow needed to save a patient\u2019s life.\n\nAccording to Health Standards, blockchain presents a feasible solution to the EMR dilemma. Blockchain can act as a centralized public ledger \u2014 much as it does for bitcoin transactions \u2014 that can serve as an immutable and comprehensive record of patient data.\n\nHealthcare data is a valuable thing, and as with any valuable thing, it can be hoarded to the detriment of the public. Institutions \u201csilo\u201d data when they keep it inaccessible to others, impeding collaboration and discovery.\n\nThis may be justifiable behaviour for some data classes due to privacy concerns, but for many other data groups, siloing, whether an intentional economic strategy or simply the result of inefficient data management, impedes healthcare research and progress. Forbes recently deemed data silos \u201cHealthcare\u2019s Silent Shame\u201d.\n\nAgain using block chain\u2019s immutable public ledger, research data stored on the blockchain can be made universally accessible and searchable. Duplicated research efforts and \u201cmissed connections\u201d can be reduced or even eliminated through blockchain technology.\n\nSo let\u2019s say healthcare data gets smarter and bigger, and for any provider or researcher there\u2019s suddenly a lot more compatible information to look through. Are there further applications for that data than humans running searches? Absolutely. AI is being designed to help with data analytics in plenty of industries, including healthcare. A machine-learning AI program can identify new areas for innovation by sorting through millions and millions of data points faster than any human ever could. AI\u2019s data-sorting capabilities are already being explored by companies such as Google and Intel.\n\nA few companies are proposing promising blockchain solutions to healthcare issues. One particularly innovative start-up is Nano Vision. Nano Vision is creating a global, decentralized blockchain economy that can be used to store health data on the molecular level. They\u2019ve partnered with Arm, the world\u2019s leading semiconductor IP Company, to produce sophisticated chips smaller than a pinhead.\n\nThe system-on-chip architecture can be used by researchers, doctors, and ordinary \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d in a variety of environments and devices to collect data on health issues such as superbugs or heart disease.\n\nAll data collected by the chips is encoded on the Nano Sense blockchain, creating an immutable, universally accessible database of vital healthcare data. Nano\u2019s platform uses AI and machine learning to constantly analyze the ever-growing dataset, becoming smarter the more data it looks at.\n\nThe AI will ultimately be able to predict new trends and areas of collaboration for future healthcare research, drawing connections that ordinary human searchers may struggle to find in such an immense amount of data. Not that far into the future, scientific breakthroughs may be made by a partnership of researchers and AI.\n\nNano Vision maintains its blockchain ecosystem by minting a dedicated crypto currency on the data-gathering chips. The Nano tokens can be bought and sold like other crypto currencies, and within the Nano economy users can allocate funds to research that are particularly important to them.\n\nInfrastructure development and privacy issues are both big hurdles to clear for blockchain-based healthcare disruption, but they\u2019re not impossible to conquer. The key will be to pay attention to true innovators in the blockchain world, who are exploring the very best possible uses for this revolutionary technology. Nano Vision is one of those innovators."

        "title": "How Do I Publish a Post Every Day? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "A few days ago, I was checking my Google Analytics stats. I came across several search queries by my visitors. One of those queries was \u201chow to write every day.\u201d That was a great topic to write a post about.\n\nIf you wonder whether I have written on a topic or not, you can use the search box on any page of my blog. You can also reach out to me directly with a comment or using the contact page.\n\nI published a blog post per day for the last five months. That was quite a feat, if you consider that I have a full time job. I\u2019ll go over the details of how I did it in this post.\n\nIf you want to publish a post per day, you have to commit to it. You put this goal high in your priorities list. Only few things are more important than publishing a post per day.\n\nMaybe your post might not be exceptional on some days, but you will hit the publish button in either case.\n\nI dedicate 2+ hours exclusively to writing every single day. I don\u2019t include interacting with readers, participating on social media, checking my stats, or improving the design of my blog in those 2+ hours.\n\nActually, I work longer in weekends and on holidays. I work on extra tasks such as stats, design, and email newsletters on those days.\n\nI know that I have lost 80% of my readers at this moment, but I\u2019m going to be honest. I\u2019m not going to lie about my process in order to get new followers and email newsletter subscribers.\n\nHow Fast Do You Want to Reach Your Goals?\n\nFirst of all, you don\u2019t have to publish every day. I publish every day, because I want to reach my goals as fast as possible. You can publish as much as you want.\n\nMy research showed me that posts published on Monday receive twice as many views compared to the posts published on other days. That means you have to publish on Mondays. You can take a few days off in the rest of the week.\n\nBy publishing every day, you build a momentum with yourself and with your readers.\n\nYou keep your mind sharp and focused on writing. Writing becomes a fundamental part of your life. Your mind works on your posts even if you don\u2019t think about them. You won\u2019t get that benefit from publishing a few days a week.\n\nYour readers know that they\u2019ll find a new post in your blog every day. That means they can visit your blog whenever they\u2019re bored and want something new to read. And people get bored. After a while, this becomes a habit. They visit your blog even if they aren\u2019t bored.\n\nYou become a part of their life. They tell themselves \u201clet me check what Burak wrote today,\u201d because they know that you wrote something that day. This is why people check news every day.\n\nIf you take into account the momentum factor, the blogger who publishes every day has a greater advantage than just the extra few posts they publish. If they publish twice as much as the average blogger, they reach their goal faster than twice as the average blogger.\n\nIf your blog is up and running, don\u2019t do anything else for your blog before publishing your post.\n\nIn essence, do nothing for your blog before publishing your post.\n\nPerfect Is the Enemy of Good\n\nI know that my blog posts aren\u2019t perfect. I can write a good blog post in two hours. I can easily spend another two hours on improving my post and it still wouldn\u2019t be perfect.\n\nAll of these tips and others would increase the quality of my posts, but they would also increase the time it takes to publish a post. And I don\u2019t have that much time to spend on each post.\n\nMake no mistake, I read my posts at least three times. I use the spelling and grammar checker of MS Word. I use Grammarly, the Hemingway app, and CoSchedule Headline Analyzer once in a while to learn some lessons, but I don\u2019t use them on a daily basis.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to publish a post per day if I didn\u2019t keep a backlog of ideas to write about. It would be impossible for me to come up with an idea on the spot, write a post about it, publish it, and repeat that every day.\n\nIf you have a difficult time to come up with post ideas, I strongly recommend that you read my post 8 Ways to Create Content on a Consistent Basis.\n\nPick an Idea and Stick to It\n\nWhen you start writing a post about an idea, stick to it until you hit the publish button. Don\u2019t go back and forth between different ideas. If you do that, you might work more than two hours and end up without a blog post.\n\nWhen I start writing a post, I\u2019m bombarded with ideas to include in that post. Human mind doesn\u2019t work in a linear fashion.\n\nWhen an idea comes up, at least half a dozen come up with it. If I start writing a paragraph about an idea, I\u2019m going to forget about the other five or six ideas that came together with it.\n\nFirst, I write down all the ideas without going into detail. That way, I don\u2019t forget any of them. Then, I organize them in an outline.\n\nI\u2019m not going into details of which tools I use to outline. For details about that, you can check my post The Tools I Use to Capture and Organize Ideas, and to Outline, Write, and Edit Blog Posts.\n\nWriting down an idea doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to use it in the post. Sometimes, I leave out some ideas. I keep some of those ideas to be used for future posts. I delete some of them forever.\n\nEven though I publish a post every day, I don\u2019t claim that my process is perfect. I have some challenges in my process. I plan to discuss my challenges and points of improvement in a future post.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to miss my post on my challenges and other posts on writing, blogging, startups, and life lessons, sign up to my email newsletter. I send a roundup of my latest posts in an email newsletter every week.\n\nPublishing a post per day has its advantages. It builds momentum for yourself and your readers.\n\nIt all starts with a commitment to hit that target. Then, you have to prioritize it over other blogging activities.\n\nYou need to learn how to stop at good enough. If you aim for perfection, you might never publish a post, let alone once a day.\n\nKeeping a backlog of ideas is crucial, because coming up with an idea in the last minute is not always feasible.\n\nIn order to avoid wasting time, stick with an idea when you start writing a post. Don\u2019t switch back and forth between ideas.\n\nDon\u2019t try to write a post in one pass. Write down your ideas first, outline them, and write the post as the last step. That way, you won\u2019t forget any ideas. Your posts will also have a logical sequence."

        "text": "My flatmates say I live like a robot.\n\nAfter waking up at my usual time, I take a cold shower and put on my one set of clothes (of which I own multiple copies, of course). What I eat and when I socialize, exercise, do my laundry and my groceries is similarly predetermined. And everything that\u2019s left \u2014 studying and writing \u2014 happens according to standardized structures of place, time and method as well.\n\nMy life consists in executing predictable sequences of rituals, which are themselves predictable sequences of individual actions.\n\nOn the contrary, routines not only make you more effective but also increase your quality of life.\n\nIt\u2019s a bummer, but our mental capacities are not unlimited. What\u2019s more, there is only one source of it. That means that every decision we make detracts from the same finite storage of precious thinking power.\n\nConsequently, when we spend more of it on humdrum puzzles, less will be available for the important stuff. As willpower research shows: stripping your life of inessential choices increases your performance on matters of significance.\n\nThe lesson: eliminate choices as much as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs all decided to routinize the way they dress. Writer Seth Godin, in similar fashion, describes his eating pattern as \u201canother decision I don\u2019t make\u201d.\n\nWhen multiple highly successful people share an uncommon behavior , we should pay attention.\n\nIt reveals that all the talk of cognitive resources is not just talk. It\u2019s real.\n\nYou should direct your energy to the areas where you make the most difference \u2014 to the stuff that really matters as opposed to futilities like what you put in your mouth or on your body.\n\nLiving according to routines is a way to accomplish this and to stop wasting your capabilities.\n\nSchematic existence is easy and hard at the same time.\n\nThe effortless part is that it saves your future self from making insignificant decisions.\n\nThe difficult part is that your future self might unwisely be tempted to question the guidelines your past self has established.\n\nFor example, Sunday-night Maarten might want Monday-morning Maarten to get up at 8:00 AM to be awesome again, whereas Monday-morning Maarten might fail to see the attraction of being awesome because that bed looks so damn comfortable.\n\nIn such cases, you need to employ tricks which nowadays go by the name of \u2018lifehacks\u2019: consciously designing your environment to ensure that your future self behaves like your present self wants him or her to.\n\nIn this scenario, Sunday-night Maarten could decide to \u2018hack\u2019 his future behavior by placing his telephone on his drawer and not next to his bed, so that Monday-morning Maarten has to get up to turn off the alarm. As a consequence, staying in bed is no longer an option. Decision eliminated.\n\nThe other day, my Japanese flatmate told me he\u2019d heard of this strategy and confessed to harboring resistance against it because, according to him, it feels like \u201cforcing yourself\u201d. What he meant to say was that removing behavioral possibilities (such as snoozing) from the life of your future self is an undesirable constraint on his or her freedom. One should not coerce his future self into doing something (such getting out of bed) he doesn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d want to.\n\nIn reply, let\u2019s look at what actually happens when you implement routines.\n\nFirst, when living according to pre-designed rituals, one part of you governs another part of your\u2014 the part that is capable of being derailed by difficulty or dullness. It is a mistake to conceive of such governance as a hostile power \u201cforcing\u201d you to do something, simply because the \u2018commanding authority\u2019 here is you.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s simply not true that Monday-morning Maarten \u201creally\u201d wants to continue sleeping. He might think he does, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\nLiving according to routines means taking long-term decisions that will shape your life like you want it to unfold, instead of succumbing to short-term gratification. By consciously arranging your own behavior, you\u2019ll act like you want yourself to act.\n\nThis, in turn, means that your life will be like you designed it to be \u2014 like you want it to be.\n\nMonday-morning Maarten also wants to get going, he just forgot about that. He is not being forced to do something against his will, he is being reminded of his true wishes.\n\nHabits do not imprison you. Rather, the opposite is true. As former United States Navy Seal Jocko Willink reminds us:\n\nLiving according to routines means that you cannot do what you might (mistakenly) think you want to do every single second of the day. However, it virtually guarantees that your life will be as you have chosen it to be because your behavior will be aligned with your (true) intentions.\n\nIf I would allow myself to be derailed by impulses that draw me away from the goal I\u2019m pursuing and the means I have accordingly instructed myself to take, the distinction between my will and my momentary longings does not exist. If I am my urges, how valuable is my existence on this planet going to be?\n\nWhen you really want to achieve something, it feels good to \u201cforce\u201d yourself. You will start getting a kick out of resisting the seduction of attractive-looking distraction.\n\nOn the other hand, not taking your long-term wishes seriously amounts to breaking your commitments to yourself. Every time you make this choice, your feeling of self-mastery will diminish. Choosing temptations over passions is like promising your lover you\u2019ll be faithful until someone else catches your eye.\n\nInstead of living on your own terms, you will be lived.\n\nNot having to deliberate about when, where and how you\u2019re going to do whatever it is that you need to do, makes you more effective at it. In many areas of life, it pays off to be a person who acts automatically.\n\nIn the words of the famous psychologist William James (1842\u20131910):\n\nBy contrast, spending your limited thinking capacity on what to put in your mouth and on your body and on when and where to work, play and exercise is going to minimize the mental resources available for the important stuff and hence will diminish your performance in the relevant areas of life.\n\nBy designing your behavior, you can avoid this trap.\n\nDesigning your life means being fully accountable for achieving your dreams.\n\nYes, that\u2019s possible. It is also scary. Often, I suspect that the intuitive resistance people harbor against robot-like behavior comes down to a refusal to take full responsibility for one\u2019s own happiness."

One of the main reasons is when has CNBC ever decided to cover a Forking Announcement (very punny I know)?\n\nA fork (soft or hard) has become a fairly common occurrence in the crypto space. The question arises which ones are real and which are scam related. Premined forked coins are always ones to be concerned with along with teams that chose to remain anonymous. Anonymous Bitcoin intends to achieve a fork of ZCL and BTC completely transparently to the public, with weekly video updates and communication with the community.\n\nThe project is titled Anonymous Bitcoin, and the Anonymous Bitcoin team intends to succeed where prior forks have failed while also adding unique technology to already tried and true blockchains. The co-fork will occur using BTC and ZCL, so in order to obtain the new forked coin, Anonymous Bitcoin, one would have to purchase either BTC or ZCL before the date of fork snapshot.\n\nThe Anonymous Bitcoin testnet will go live August 10, providing a month for exchanges to test the wallets and infrastructure before the snapshot occurs on September 9, 2018. The mainnet will be live within 48 hours of snapshot allowing for swift integration onto exchange platforms. Exchange listing and targeting ones with significant volume are one of the most important features of a new coin beyond utility and technology.\n\nThe main features of Anonymous Bitcoin will include anonymity while transacting (using zkSNARKs technology), increased transaction speed (through increased block sizes), and the ability to stake coins through masternodes. This trifecta of technological upgrades will create a cryptocurrency in Bitcoin\u2019s image, with staking abilities and anonymity upgrades.\n\nThe Anonymous Bitcoin Team is broken into multiple layers. The BTCA team is composed of the core development team, founders, advisors, social media gurus, blockchain journalists, and even crypto compliance attorneys. The core development team is led by the founders of Miami-based Bushido Lab. The most notable advisor, Steven Nerayoff, has worked on projects such as Ethereum, Lisk, tZERO, ZClassic, AION, and many more. Having advisors of this caliber is essential \u2014 especially for a forked coin \u2014 to ensure market adoption.\n\nBlockchain journalists and Fintech analysts have come on as advisors to ensure the progression within the space and to provide inside news coverage regarding the entire forking process. A production team has been assembled to provide weekly video updates about what the team has been up to regarding conferences, networking, and \u2018work\u2019 for the week. This will allow transparency literally from within. The crypto compliance attorneys are solely there to ensure we remain compliant with the ever-changing regulatory structure of cryptocurrencies. A fork is not considered a securities offering as no tokens are being sold but it always helps to have attorneys making sure compliance is maintained on all fronts.\n\nWith a roadmap that has already been structured and deadlines that will not be missed Anonymous Bitcoin is ready to begin their journey from concept to a forking cryptocurrency.\n\nPlease visit the project website Anonymousbitcoin.io \u2014 which will go live on Sunday \u2014 for further details or get in contact with the team directly:\n\nTo get in contact directly with the Crypto King, you can on Twitter (@JbtheCryptoKing) or Reddit (ICO updates and Daily Reports).

Not innovative enough. Not charismatic enough. Not successful enough. Not entrepreneurial enough.\n\nAccording to the book Finish, by Jon Acuff, this brand of negative self-talk is a tell-tale symptom of a perfectionist.\n\nAnd I now realize I most certainly am one.\n\nHowever, for decades, I was oblivious to my plight of perfectionism.\n\nIt was just recently when I pored over every page of Jon\u2019s insightful book that my diagnosis was revealed.\n\nNow, I almost feel obligated to accuse him for plagiarism.\n\nHis words were so revealing about my inner-perfectionist struggles. It felt like he had stolen sections of personal ramblings right out of my journal.\n\nFor instance, we perfectionists tend to concoct arbitrary edicts in our minds that inhibit our success and happiness.\n\nThey are buried deep within our minds and dictate how we function and react to circumstances in our day-to-day lives.\n\nWhich is unfortunate, because these \u201crules\u201d are never rooted in reality. And worst of all, they prevent us from sharing the most authentic, gift-giving version of ourselves with the world.\n\nCheck. That can be me too.\n\nWow. This is getting eerie now. Does he have cameras and microphones hidden in my house?\n\n24/7, Non-stop grind and hustle, y\u2019all. It\u2019s what any \u2018great\u2019 entrepreneur SHOULD do, right?\n\nThis sounds perfect to me. How about you? If so, you just might be a perfectionist in hiding. (Don\u2019t worry. No one is perfect.)\n\nTruth be told, I don\u2019t submit to all of these secret rules all of the time.\n\nBut instead, they are combined together into an powerful, satisfaction-stealing, impact-reducing mix tape that loops in my head over and over again.\n\nAnd the worst part? The rational side of my brain knows these secret rules are the antithesis of how I want to lead my life.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic. I try to be so-called \u201cperfect\u201d as part of a quest for maximum productivity. A bigger impact. More lives changed for the better.\n\nHowever, my secret rules contribute to the exact opposite result.\n\nI become a self-saboteur. And in the process, undermine many opportunities that would result in a more fulfilling and successful life.\n\nYou, me and everyone in-between have the ability to take every thought captive and ask ourselves:\n\nWe just have to be intentional with our thoughts and take action on the ones that harm us.\n\nWithout intentionality and self-awareness, it is very easy to hammer down your big, \u2018stamp-of-approval\u2019 on every perfectionist thought that flows through your cranium.\n\nYou tell yourself to work harder. Expect more of yourself. Don\u2019t screw up. Grit your teeth through the pain. You can, and always SHOULD do better.\n\nI wanted to finish it all in one sit-down session.\n\nScratch that. I HAD to finish it all in one session.\n\nWhy? Because my perfectionist brain told me so. The arbitrary standard had been set.\n\nSo once my 2-yr old boy awoke from his nap and screamed for me, I had a choice to make:\n\nDo I ignore him and finish this post?\n\nDo I make the right choice, the choice that aligns with my purpose to be a good father, and rescue my little man from his bedroom?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not a crazy person. I didn\u2019t ignore my screaming child.\n\nHowever, I had to fight the urge. Because there he was. The little perfectionist man on my shoulder uttering words of temptation in my ear:\n\nHow messed up is THAT?\n\nWhere in the world did this level of perfectionism get drummed into my head?\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure many influences are involved, I believe traditional schooling plays one of the biggest roles:\n\nBut this is NOT how the real world works.\n\nYou should expect to make some mistakes. You should expect to let go of trivial matters. In your business or other areas of your life.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t recommend you make mistakes on purpose. That\u2019s silly.\n\nI just believe mistakes are a natural by-product when you achieve sizable success\u2014no matter how much time and energy you spend on your \u201cperfect\u201d plan.\n\nBecause many times, \u201cgood\u201d is good enough.\n\nYou need to reprogram your brain and renew your mind. Your secret rules MUST be expunged once and for all.\n\nAccording to Jon Acuff, in order to overcome the \u201csecret\u201d perfectionist rules many of us follow, you must do 3 things:\n\nNow, I won\u2019t go into super detail on each step here. I\u2019ll leave the juicy details for the book if you want to buy a copy from Jeff Bezos.\n\nAs you hop from entry to entry, look for trends and patterns in your thoughts.\n\nDig deep. Keep spelunking. You will find what you seek to destroy. (And Jon reveals a few key questions in his book that can help you find your secret rules faster.)\n\nThen what do you do once you find the sneaky, perfectionist culprits?\n\nNEVER, ever allow your secret rules to hold you hostage again.\n\nBecause even though you may not realize it, there\u2019s a good chance you follow a few secret rules right this very second.\n\nThey are the gatekeepers. The bouncers. The tough guys standing between you and whatever your heart desires to achieve.\n\nBut heed this warning now: This \u201cidentify, destroy, and replace\u201d process will take more than 10 minutes.\n\nYou will need multiple cuddle sessions with your journal before you unearth all of the secret rules buried deep within your head.\n\nBut I promise you, the effort is worth the reward.\n\nSo now it\u2019s time. I\u2019m near the end of this post. And as usual, perfectionism is taking its last stand in my mind with a laundry list of questions:\n\nHow perfect was my post here today?\n\nDid I really provide enough value?\n\nDid I clearly communicate the jumbled thoughts bouncing around in my head\u2014with ZERO mistakes or oversights?\n\nUh oh. Now the thoughts have become even more ruthless\u2026\n\nNope. I am not. Which is exactly why I should hit the publish button anyway."

        "title": "How To Fire Better And Have A Happier Company \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "How To Fire Better And Have A Happier Company\n\nThis article is for small businesses and startups that will soon need to start hiring staff.\n\nIf you run a startup at some point you will have to start hiring people. Even worse, at some point, you will have to fire people as well.\n\nThis is never fun, but necessary. The below is a detail of one of the most important things to watch out for and fire based on.\n\nI have heard the phrase \u201chire fast, fire faster\u201d in different contexts, so I am in no way trying to claim ownership of it. In fact, I don\u00b4t even agree with it. The correct term should be \u201chire slow, fire at medium speed\u201d.\n\nNever \u201chire fast\u201d. That insinuates hiring without doing proper due diligence. Not to do due diligence in hiring is the worst advice one could give. Your business is the people you hire. Your staff will shape your business, and your business will shape your staff. Always remember this, and have it close at mind when hiring.\n\nThat goes without saying. If you need someone to program, they need to know how to program. If you need someone to sell your product, they need to know how to sell. This goes without saying.\n\nThere is another factor that is as or more important though:\n\nEven the most gifted person in the world will be disastrous for you if he operates from a non-compatible value set.\n\nIf a person does not have personal integrity and honesty, that person will never be good for your company. He might produce great results in the short run, but will never be a success in the long.\n\nIt is very difficult to judge someone\u2019s personality and personal values in interviews. Yet, there is no doubt that the more effort you put in in the interview process, the better picture you can get. Which is why I would never advocate \u201chiring fast\u201d. But don\u00b4t \u201chire slow\u201d either. Never let bureaucracy or red tape reasons slow it down. But also never skip any steps, no matter how promising a candidate may look.\n\nAnd this goes for no matter what role you are filling. A person needs to fit echo your values no matter whether he is cleaning, programming, or managing.\n\nNo matter how well you do in your recruiting, you will get it wrong at times. Sometimes you find a perfect candidate, only to find out that they do not share your values later.\n\nYou need to be good at distinguishing where them issues lie though. Do they not do as they should due to poor supervision or training, or due to a different set of values.\n\nBoth of these situations are your responsibility, but the solutions are different.\n\nThis brings me to my second point and the main point of this article.\n\nIf you have people on your staff that are being dishonest or operating from a different value set to you, fire them. End of story.\n\nIf a person acts according to values that are incompatible with yours now, they will not change. The likelihood of them changing is very low, and the effort needed to get there will exceed the output. Finding a new suitable candidate will cost you much less time and effort. And don\u00b4t forget a mental and emotional headache and \u201cputting out fires\u201d time saved.\n\nThe reason why I don\u00b4t call this \u201cfire fast\u201d is that you need to be sure that this person is acting against your value set. You can\u00b4t fire on a hunch, something someone said or a situation that could have been misunderstood. But when you are sure, when there is no doubt, you have to fire that person.\n\nAnd it doesn\u00b4t matter how gifted that person is, his experience, reputation or anything else. All that matters is whether he/she can work according to your values. And that is a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question. No grey areas. You might have to swallow some pride is you were the one who brought the person in, and did so under big fanfare.\n\nKeeping a person who does not act according to your values, can be devastating for your company. You can\u00b4t trust the person to do the correct tasks. The person will have a negative impact on their coworker\u2019s motivation and behaviour. Coworkers will get demoralised by seeing no action taken. And much much more. I have experienced this myself. In my company we have been too slow in acting on these signs in the past, leaving damage that has taken a while to clean up.\n\nI will finish this article by giving some examples of the values I operate by and judge my colleagues on:\n\nIf I cannot trust a person in small things, I cannot trust that person with big things. If a person tells white lies about small things, I cannot work with that person. If a person takes credit for other people\u00b4s work, I cannot work with that person.\n\nIf you have read any of my other stuff, you will see that taking responsibility is a point that is of great interest to me. I believe we must all take responsibility for everything that happens to us, be it something we have influence over, or not. If a person always blames or complains or can find fault with others but not themselves, I cannot work with them.\n\nPerfectionism and stubbornness are great traits, as it can power great things. Too much of it is not great, as it prevents a person from adapting to his/her surroundings. If a person cannot adapt to changing scenarios and environments but expects others to adapt to them, I cannot work with them.\n\nA person has to stay humble. A person has to stay modest. This to me does not mean that he/she cannot celebrate victories, be happy and proud of achievements and so on. This means that the person has a humble approach. They have respect for all and never forget where they came from.\n\nA person that does not learn from experience and mistakes, who cannot take feedback or who does not grow and develop over time, I cannot work with.\n\nI hope you by reading this will be saved from some of the headache and experience I and others have had. There is no easy way around it. The only way you can do what is best for you and your company is to get rid of the people who do not fit it."

        "text": "\u201cOne match is enough to make an explosion\u201d\n\nThe 9/11 events changed the world in more ways than one. The ripples of the terrorist attack touched many lives, industries and business spheres. It sealed the compliance regulations mandate in the USA, through legislations like the Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act etc.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, like the rest of the world, followed the lead and rolled out the speculated \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d in a full-fledged manner in 2004[1]. This was followed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2012[2].\n\nSimply put, the KYC norms mandate every customer of the bank to prove the veracity of their existence by submitting the Proof of Identity and Proof of Address. Consequently, the KYC process involves collecting, tracking and storing huge amounts of data, so that it may be reported to regulatory agencies in a timely fashion.\n\nWith the world virtually becoming boundary-free, cross-border banking transactions have grown by leaps and bounds. So has the need to ensure adequate security measure are in place.\n\nThe Need for KYC\n\nAnonymous accounts are restricted entry into the banking system. Preliminary pieces of information such as names, birth dates, addresses, contact numbers are collected.\n\nIn the case of suspicious banking transactions, the customer accounts can be flagged under Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) process to the bank head office for review.\n\nSpurious and doubtful activity in any account can be zeroed in by the bank after understanding its customer base using KYC.\n\nNow that bank has all the preliminary information and activity patter, it can assess the risk and the likelihood of the customer being involved in illegal transactions\n\nFINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE (FATF) was to enforce the following acts for KYC [3]:\n\n\u2022 Every bank has their own specifications they adhere to\n\n\u2022 Due to this lack of standardization, complying to each request in a customized way is time consuming.\n\n\u2022 Regulation rules are changed often; adding more compliance burden on the banks.\n\n\u2022 For example, in Cyprus, it is mandated that each relationship manager have an in-person meeting with the customer as part of the KYC process [4].\n\n\u2022 It becomes understandably irksome for a customer to provide the same information to different banking entities, sometimes in the same jurisdiction.\n\n\u2022 Banks may even have more follow ups periodically for KYC.\n\n\u2022 Thomson Reuters estimated via a survey, that due to hassle of KYC, onboarding costs increased by 18% and they foretell a further rise of 14%.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThe blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger shared in the public domain. Every participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination.\n\nIn its essence, since it is devoid of any single central authority, banks are taking keen interest in its applications to solve the hassles created by the present use of the KYC process.\n\nFor KYC operations, banks can use a either a private or a public blockchain. In a private one, the bank uses it for its internal audit and regulatory compliance. In a public one, where it shares data and control with other institutions.\n\n1. Whenever a new customer enters into the ecosystem, the \u2018Trusted Party\u2019 i.e. the bank verifies the documents.\n\n2. Once checked for veracity, the bank uploads this data onto the blockchain\n\n3. Whenever any new data is needed to be appended, the ledger could enable encrypted updates to the ledger.\n\n4. These updates can be accessed by other entities in real time as and when required.\n\n5. A Digital Identity \u2014 analogous to a digital passport \u2014 of the on-boarded customer can then be used as a trust sign for future transactions.\n\n\u00b7 Data alterations can be tracked and monitored \u2014 chances of misuse and fraud are reduced.\n\n\u00b7 Since all data is stored in a homogeneous blockchain, resulting better governance and use of data would help banks detect fraud at an earlier stage.\n\n\u00b7 Direct access to the KYC data could save huge amount of time for institutions.\n\n\u00b7 The hassle of disparity in specifications can thus be eliminated.\n\n\u00b7 Required compliance reports can be automatically generated from the data of the blockchain. This would help reduce non-compliance penalties.\n\n\u00b7 Manual error while performing the KYC initiation can be avoided.\n\n\u00b7 The trust factor in the veracity of blockchain is built on the fact that the verifying parties are doing their job with due diligence.\n\n\u00b7 To this end, the authenticity of data depends on the integrity of the \u2018Trusted Parties\u2019 to ensure the data is valid.\n\n\u00b7 It needs to be decided whether the blockchain would be a private or a public one or even a hybrid one.\n\n\u00b7 Even so, it is a question whether the child private blockchains would be used integrated into the central global one.\n\n\u00b7 Variables which change often are difficult to track for banks, e.g. minority investors with <25% stake in a client company.\n\n\u00b7 Thus, off market transactions involving such ever changing data can be a dilemma.\n\nSBI to roll out Blockchain in KYC [5]\n\n\u201cBy next month, we should have two beta production solutions ready for use by the 27 banks. We will also invite further participation. The beta production that will be ready are smart contracts and second is KYC,\u201d\n\nIBM has partnered with HSBC, Mitsubishi UFG, Deutsche Bank. It is a part of the Shared Corporate Know Your Customer platform. To this end, IBM was working on its Proof-of-Concept. Its phase I has been completed.\n\nCognizant is helping Indian Insurance companies to build a robust platform using the blockchain technology. This is to assist the Insurers to collect customer and policy information for various KYC related due diligence activities.\n\n5.

        "text": "You pour blood, sweat and tears into your business, you are passionate about what you do and you believe 100% in your product \u2014 however, after a few years, your business still has not grown as much as you expected. Perhaps you are making some marketing mistakes that you are not aware of. If this sounds like your situation. read on!\n\nAs a business owner, you may have tried different marketing campaigns and want to find out which ones work best for your business. There are two terms that I am sure you have heard of \u2014 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and LTV (Lifetime Value). Most people solely focus on CAC as it is the easiest way to find out if a marketing campaign is worth continuing. However, not taking LTV into consideration is like not looking at the big picture.\n\nFor example, It is cheaper to acquire new customers in marketing channel A but those new customers spend less and churn within a year. On the other hand, marketing channel B costs slightly more to acquire new customers but the customers from this channel stay longer than two years and each year they spend more than the customers from marketing channel A.\n\nAs you can see, if you only look at CAC when doing your marketing campaigns, you are making a mistake. If you want to learn more about how to calculate LTV, Kissmetrics has a blog post that is worth checking out.\n\nThere are different marketing channels you can experiment and find out which ones perform well and fit your budget. However, oftentimes, marketing channels work best when they are combined. That\u2019s called strategy. For instance, Your brand is pretty new and you are going to release a new product feature that is unique on the market, you want to have a campaign that can generate more sign-ups. The first challenge you need to tackle is how to make people know about your brand. This is a brand awareness campaign. There are many ways to raise brand awareness \u2014 for instance, PR and advertising (both online and offline). The second challenge is you need to make them realize they need your product \u2014 you can educate your prospects by content marketing. Finally, your third challenge is how to get people to sign up (lead generating) \u2014 it can be done through affiliate marketing, email marketing and so on.\n\nTo achieve your target, getting more sign-ups, it requires more than one marketing channel.\n\nMarketing channels do not work well individually, you have to do some mix and match to find the best combination to achieve your marketing goals.\n\nYour marketing manager maybe Superman or Superwoman but to make a business successful \u2014 working solo is not the answer. To drive the growth of a business, different teams need to work together, for example, your sales team, product team as well as customer service team should be involved in the marketing process. For instance, your marketing team generated lots of qualified leads but only a small percentage became paying customers. For a case like this, you may want to have a look at your sales funnel, product and customer service team performance.\n\nYour website was SEO optimized when it was launched and then you just sit back and relax \u2014 this mistake could cost you a fortune.\n\nSearch engines and social media platform change their algorithm from time to time. Recently, Google is gradually rolling out mobile first indexing. If your website is not responsive or the mobile version does not display full content as its web version, your website\u2019s ranking could be affected because of this algorithm update.\n\nSimilarly, Facebook has changed their algorithm and the new updates prioritize content from friends and family as this kind of content usually creates meaningful conversation and interaction.\n\nIf you stick with your old SEO and social media strategy, you will never win the ever-changing marketing game.\n\nPersonalization doesn\u2019t only mean adding your customer\u2019s first name after Hello in your email. It also means providing personalization experience throughout the entire customer journey which includes marketing. Let say a prospect clicked on your banner ad that sells content marketing service and downloaded a whitepaper about content marketing. As a full service marketing agency, when you approach this prospect, first you can start with a check in email and find out if your prospect found the whitepaper useful, then continue with introducing your agency\u2019s content marketing service. Your marketing tools and CRM should be able to provide you with your prospects\u2019 footprints \u2014 from the very first contact to the deal closing so you can see the entire customer journey and provide great personalized experience.\n\nBuyer persona is important for almost every areas of your business. It is a profile of your ideal customer. Depending on your business, you can have a few or ten different buyer personas. Your buyer personas can be based on the data from your existing customer base, market research and so on. Once you have defined how your ideal customers look like in terms of income, spending habits, age group, interests, etc., you will be able to formulate your business strategies more easily. For example, you can create content that caters a specific group of prospects or customers that share the same buyer persona. Similarly, you can review your pricing based on the income and spending habits of this group of people.\n\nIf you do not define your buyer personas, you may be wasting your marketing budget on the wrong groups of people and that leads to low conversion and retention rate.\n\nI believe every great product deserves success. Oftentimes, a startup failure is not because of the product, it\u2019s due to mistakes in marketing, finance or management. Don\u2019t let avoidable mistakes ruin your great product and kill your passion."

We all agree that it isn\u2019t \n\na lot of money, especially if it is for an app we\u2019ll use for months or years. \n\nBut most of us refuse to pay for apps as a rule. We normally search for an alternative. The free app. In fact, the forecast for 2015 was that two-thirds of US mobile users will only download free apps. It is no wonder that in 2018 over 94 percent of Android apps are offered for free.\n\nIf there are so many free apps \u2014 why should we pay?\n\nWe don\u2019t value the time and money the developers spent \u2014 we want it now and we want it free. \n\nThis behavioral pattern is not only exclusive for apps, though.\n\nTake books, for example. Since the appearance of digital books, there has been a tremendous increase of books available online. It has become easier to publish a book. All you need is to write one and upload it online. That\u2019s it. \n\nAnd there are millions of e-books offered for free. Therefore, many people decide not to buy the latest best-selling fiction and find a free e-book instead, as if it was the same product. While both are categorized as \u2018fiction books\u2019 they are definitely not identical.\n\nAnd what about music?\n\nOnce music was available online, although illegally, people stopped buying CDs.

        "text": "This is now the eighth year I\u2019m blogging. I like writing. Writing helps me to get to the point. And by this I mean, really to the point and not just to bullet points on a slide of PowerPoint. Formulating thoughts in such a way that they appeal to the reader and the message reaches the reader is damn hard work. It requires discipline and concentration \u2014 for every article, every week again. It is all the more astonishing that Jeff Bezos has banned PowerPoint completely and instead insists on six-page narratives, which are then studied in silence (sic!) by everyone at the beginning of a meeting. If Jeff Bezos and his team utilize their time in this way in the extremely fast-moving business fields in which Amazon in very successful, this can be seen as an inspiration for all of us to tell more and better stories instead of heartlessly enumerating endless lists of bullet points.\n\nLong before people began using written (about 2,000 to 3,000 BC) and then printed word (and finally PowerPoint\u2026) to carry messages, they told each other stories. It is believed that people had fully developed their language skills around 35,000 BC. The epic cave paintings of Lascaux suggest that people were already telling each other stories back then. All world religions are full of stories and parables. Even today, a good story fascinates people like few other things, turns films into blockbusters, books into bestsellers and makes actors, directors and authors world-famous. Actually, it is an obvious thing to use this ancient fascination for well-structured stories for meetings as well, as Jeff Bezos does.\n\nAnd of course there are also very good presentations on slides. And there are even still speakers who tell fascinating stories without any slides. But that\u2019s not the point. These exceptions confirm the unfortunate rule that PowerPoint leads to shallowness. For both the sender and the recipient. PowerPoint is communicative fast food: useful at best, usually not very nutritious and harmful in the long run.\n\nAnyone who has written longer texts knows how difficult this is compared to a few isolated bullet points. Not everyone has both the talent and the practice for this. Even at Amazon, the quality of the memos varies considerably, as Jeff Bezos himself admits in his last annual letter. Nevertheless, I can well understand that the preparation of meetings in the form of multi-page structured texts leads to a significantly higher quality. And the joint study of the memo at the beginning of the meeting is a beautiful ritual and a mindful moment of deceleration, which brings the necessary attention to the author and his matter. A very important, if not the most important aspect of Jeff Bezos\u2019 rule."

        "text": "Humans are driven to explore the unknown and discover new worlds. We are keen to push boundaries of our scientific knowledge and technical limits. The intangible desire to explore and challenge the boundaries of what we know and where we have been has provided benefits to our society for centuries.\n\nWhat is Space Exploration?\n\nHumanity\u2019s interest in the heavens has been universal and enduring, they have dreamed about spaceflight since antiquity.\n\nSpace exploration is the investigation, by means of crewed and un-crewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chinese used rockets for celebratory and military purposes centuries ago, however in the latter half of the 20th century rockets were developed that were powerful enough to overcome the force of gravity and reach orbital velocities that could open space to human exploration.\n\n\u00b7 The first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, went into orbit on January 31, 1958. In 1961 Alan Shepard became the first American to fly into space.\n\n\u00b7 On February 20, 1962, John Glenn\u2019s historic flight made him the first American to orbit Earth.\n\n\u00b7 On July 20, 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong took \u201ca giant step for mankind\u201d as he stepped onto the moon. Six Apollo missions were made to explore the moon between 1969 and 1972.\n\n\u00b7 By the early 1970s orbiting communications and navigation satellites were in everyday use, and the Mariner spacecraft was orbiting and mapping the surface of Mars. By the end of the decade, the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and their moons.\n\n\u00b7 Skylab, America\u2019s first space station, was a human-spaceflight highlight of the 1970s, as was the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, the world\u2019s first internationally crewed (American and Russian) space mission\n\nHistorians have distinguished three great Ages of Exploration: \n\n1) The Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries associated with Prince Henry the Navigator, Columbus, Magellan and other European explorer.\n\n2) The Second Age (18th and 19th centuries) characterized by further geographic exploration such as the voyages of Captain Cook, underpinned and driven by the scientific revolution.\n\n3) The Third Age beginning with the International Geophysical Year and Sputnik, primarily associated with space exploration, but also with the Antarctic and the oceans.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, bioastronautics and space medicine research demonstrated that humans could survive in space, work in space and perform complex scientific missions on the surface of another celestial body. After the exponential growth in short duration flight objectives of the sixties, the past four decades have focused on the development of a long duration capability for human spaceflight. The vision of sending humans farther into the solar system was shared by many experts within the United States and Russia. For that vision to become reality, the acclimation of humans to space had to be studied over the course of months not days. The Russian Salyut series of space stations and the NASA Skylab program that highlighted the next decade of human spaceflight were used to evaluate the capacity of humans to live and work in microgravity for long periods of time. Both programs provided fundamental data on space physiology relevant to space medicine, but they also demonstrated the need for extended long duration missions on board a new generation of space stations.\n\nResearchers at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) worked in collaboration with experts in DCS at the Defence Research and Development Canada Centre in Toronto to participate as one of three NASA supported research sites to develop the new pre-breathe protocols for use in preparation for spacewalks from the Internadiagtional Space Station. This led to widespread recognition among the international partners of Canadian expertise in life science and space medicine research, which has continued into the current phase of ISS utilization.\n\nSpace medicine can be defined as the area of medical practice that deals with the provision of healthcare in partial and micro gravitational environments. The scope of care not only deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury in space, it involves pre-flight medical selection and conditioning as well as post-flight rehabilitation. The expansion of commercial space operations to include SFPs and potentially career astronauts flying on commercial spacecraft in suborbital and orbital flights presents a number of potential issues to the space medicine community. The FAA has released a series of requirements for crew and SFPs on commercial spacecraft in support of the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004.\n\nDespite rigorous screening programs, the increased size of the ISS crew coupled with the long duration missions and the increasing frequency of flights by SFPs suggests that the frequency of on-orbit medical events may increase. While the majority of these events include space adaptation syndrome, motion sickness, back pain, musculoskeletal problems and disrupted sleep, the potential for a more significant medical event exists. For this reason, there has been considerable interest and research in developing and testing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic modalities over the past decade that will continue throughout ISS utilization.\n\nThe current paradigm for provision of healthcare on the ISS is based on dedicated crew medical officers (CMOs) utilizing the resources of the Crew Health Care System (CHeCS) to prevent, diagnose and treat on orbit medical events. A number of integrated medical kits are available on the ISS to treat the common medical problems that arise in space as outlined in the Integrated Medical Group medical operations checklist for expedition flights. In some cases the CMO is a physician, but for the most part, they are crew members that have received additional medical training in preparation for the mission. CMOs provide care under the direction of Flight Surgeons in mission control based on voice/video private medical conferences. This approach has been extremely effective in managing the medical events that have taken place in space.\n\nWith current technology, other diagnostic imaging (DI) technologies are not practical for use in space. Further research on the role of diagnostic ultrasound and the development of alternative DI technologies is as important as an exploration enabling capability for future missions beyond low earth orbit. Past research efforts have focused on understanding the physiologic acclimation to microgravity with the development of a series of preventive countermeasures leading to further work that will continue to improve this preventive strategy. However, there is a tremendous amount of clinical research that is needed.\n\nWhat needs to be done?\n\nThe future of human spaceflight will likely include increased accessibility and utilization of-low earth orbit for commercial ventures and continued use of the ISS, ultimately leading to a transition back to exploration missions potentially involving lunar return or missions to Mars. The need to further develop mission-specific medical capability involves discussions of the balance between the need for a \u201cstand-and-fight\u201d capability and the utilization of a \u201cload-and-go\u201d approach to returning to Earth for definitive medical care. Currently approaches to on orbit health care use both approaches with the combination of immediate clinical care combined with the potential for an urgent or emergent deorbit and landing for definitive medical care. As humans travel farther into space, a medical abort to Earth scenario becomes less practical and at some point transitions to continued flight to the destination. This raises a number of questions about defining the appropriate level of care, the effect of longer signal transmission to Earth on crew autonomy and the role that new technologies will play in the delivery of healthcare during the different phases of the mission.\n\nThe next decade provides an opportunity for further ISS research to develop new diagnostic and treatment capabilities, assess new technologies and evaluate strategies for CMO skill retention and just-in-time training. This research will be important to prepare for exploration class missions beyond low earth orbit in addition to developing on board clinical care for commercial space complexes. Based on the terrestrial approach of providing on-board healthcare for commercial ocean cruises, it is likely that commercial space complexes will have an on-board clinic with a physician or other health care professional providing clinical care. The evolution of commercial space travel in the decades to come will extend the scope of space medicine beyond the realm of the government supported human spaceflight into the realm of civilian spaceflight. While the objectives of human space travel will differ between the government and commercial groups, there will be a shared interest amongst practitioners of space medicine in developing the best approaches to prevent and treat illnesses and injuries during a mission.\n\n\u00b7 It allows people to know more about the universe.\n\n\u00b7 It can offer a solution to many problems \n\n(aside from collecting information about the outer space, many space exploration programs are used to address some of the problems that plague modern society. Some programs, for example, help scientists learn more about the earth\u2019s atmosphere and know how to better predict weather and natural disasters. Others, meanwhile, focus on looking for planets that can support human life, which may be the solution to the earth\u2019s growing population.)\n\n\u00b7 It paves the way to advanced technology.\n\n3. An artificial heart pump based on the design of NASA\u2019s space shuttle main engine fuel pumps that supplements the heart\u2019s pumping capacity in the left ventricle\n\n4. Teflon-coated fiberglass developed in the 1970s as a new fabric for astronaut spacesuits has been used as a permanent roofing material for buildings and stadiums.\n\n\u00b7 It is a costly endeavour\n\n(In 2005 NASA had a budget of $16.2 billion; this includes not only the human spaceflight division, but also other engineering projects, and science funded by NASA. The total federal spending budget in 2005 was on the order of $2 trillion ($2000 billion), making the NASA share 0.8% of the budget).\n\n\u00b7 There is a possibility of bringing back harmful elements to Earth.\n\n\u00b7 It leads to pollution in space.\n\n\u00b7 It poses risks to astronauts.\n\nIt can\u2019t be denied that space exploration puts astronauts\u2019 lives in danger. In fact, many accidents have happened over the years and have resulted to numerous injuries and even deaths. Even if missions don\u2019t always end up in disasters, they can still expose astronauts to a wide range of health problems. Studies have shown that spending long periods of time in zero gravity can seriously affect a person\u2019s cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems and make him prone to various illnesses. Exposure to high-energy ionizing cosmic rays, which are present in space, can lead to the development of cancer.\n\nSpace exploration is one of the biggest achievements of humans as a whole, and it has paved the way to greater scientific understanding and many technological advancement over the years. A lot of people think we should give up space exploration, largely due to cost (and it is expensive \u2014 NASA spends approximately 16 billion tax dollars each year). But money spent on space exploration does not nebulously float away into the galaxy. It creates new technologies and products, as well as new jobs and businesses. So maybe you could live without Tang, but would you give up your computer, the GPS navigating system in your car, or your cell phone? Just within the next few years, the space program is expected to improve our knowledge of solar energy power, cryogenics, and robotics that are expected to offer great improvements in health care, energy and the environment, everyday technology, and many other areas. However, it can\u2019t be denied that it also has several drawbacks, which is why governments and scientists should find a balance between the advantages and disadvantages as soon as possible.\n\n\u00b7 Link MM.

        "text": "In the last six weeks, I was focused on two numbers to measure the success of my blog. These are the weekly growth rates of my Medium following and the number of my email newsletter subscribers.\n\nMy weekly goal for both figures is 10%. That goal is at the ambitious side and I have a difficult time achieving it every week.\n\nSo far, my average was 7%. Not bad, but not being able to succeed my goal every week frustrates me a little. That\u2019s why I want to look at other sides of my efforts than the weekly goals.\n\nOnline business expert Gary Vaynerchuk recommends to focus on \u201cthe clouds and dirt\u201d and to avoid everything in between. The clouds is the long term vision. The dirt is the tasks and challenges in front of you.\n\nIn my case, the dirt is my weekly goals and how I want to achieve them. I\u2019ve been focused on the dirt for the last six weeks. Today, I want to look at the clouds, the vision, the big picture of my efforts.\n\nI\u2019ll use the karmic management model of Michael Roach to analyze my blog. I discussed this model in detail in my post A Buddhist Monk\u2019s Take on Business.\n\nThe Ideal and Less than Ideal Business\n\nI make a distinction between ideal and less than ideal businesses. Ideal businesses add value to humanity. Less than ideal businesses extract value from the humanity.\n\nIdeal businesses make a positive difference in the lives of other people. They provide value. That value has a financial equivalent. Ideal businesses receive a fraction of that value.\n\nLess than ideal businesses extract value from the humanity. They do that by exploiting the weaknesses of people.\n\nMost of us have their irrationalities. Some of those irrationalities are predictable. Less than ideal businesses build their business on exploiting those predictable irrationalities.\n\nThe World Is Not Black and White\n\nObviously, we can\u2019t make a black and white distinction between ideal and less than ideal businesses. As I explained in my post the Fallacy of Extremism, that would be a childish outlook on life. Most businesses are somewhere between both polarities.\n\nFor example, gambling businesses provide some value by entertaining their customers. Educational businesses have to use some marketing techniques to convince their prospects to pay for their products and services.\n\nThe karmic management model takes into account four parties to measure the potential of a business.\n\nI want to add a fifth party to this model: myself.\n\nI plan to build an information marketing business around my blog. So far, I have been writing mainly about personal development and marketing.\n\nI consumed a lot of personal development products and services. Those products and services made significant differences in my life. Some of those products and services were paid. There was an exchange of value both ways.\n\nIn some cases, I paid more than what the product or service was worth for. In some cases, I received great value for free. Some free YouTube channels and videos made significant, tangible, positive changes in my life.\n\nIn either case, I\u2019m more than satisfied as a paying customer of the personal development industry. My own experience is a validation of the personal development business.\n\nIn the past, I developed several products. Those products benefited their users, but I wasn\u2019t able to commercialize them. Marketing and sales were the missing link between those products and their prospective users.\n\nI\u2019m not alone. A lot of gifted people have a difficult time building a business around their skills. They have a difficult time building products and services using their skills or commercializing the products and services they offer.\n\nI want to create content that helps people build and commercialize products and services around their skills. But first, I have to figure that out myself. I work on it and I document everything that I learn on my journey.\n\nI already receive the feedback that the lessons I share resonate with people. If you want to receive the latest lessons I discover on my journey, sign up to my weekly email newsletter.\n\nBottom line, I believe that there is value for my prospective customers in my information marketing business, both in personal development and marketing segments.\n\nI don\u2019t have any employees at the moment. There\u2019s only one person who helps me with household once a week. I\u2019m grateful for their services, because they save me a complete day every week.\n\nAs I build a business around my blog, I could hire freelancers such as virtual assistants, programmers, and writers.\n\nMy business would benefit several suppliers. I already pay for hardware, software, internet connection, and for some tools, such as Evernote and Google Drive.\n\nI review the tools that I use in my blog posts. I believe that is fair value provided to my suppliers.\n\nI serve humanity by providing as much value as I can in the ideal side of business.\n\nI enjoy blogging, writing, developing products and services on personal development and marketing.\n\nSometimes, we lose the big picture of our businesses by being too focused on day to day details. That was the case with my weekly goals.\n\nToday, I wrote down my business vision using the karmic management principles. Now, I can clearly see the long term benefits of my business to its prospective customers, suppliers, employees, humanity at large, and myself.\n\nAll of that helps me put things in perspective and not get frustrated when I miss a weekly goal or two."

        "text": "Even if I tend to be hyper skeptical in general on ICO, when I incur in an exciting project I can\u2019t refrain myself to get involved somehow. By now, I have a good number of ICOs done under my belt covering different roles (investor, advisor, pool organizer, etc.).\n\nWhat really amazes me, of the cryptosphere in general and the ICOs in particular, is how everything changes so quickly and continuously, it is very liquid and putting fresh money in it or getting involved helps to keep yourself on top of it and is exciting.\n\nWhat I really dislike is how most of the people involved in ICO have insane expectations of getting rich with it, initially the greed was mainly on entrepreneurs side, then all the parties involved started wanting a piece of it: the advisors and professionals, then the exchanges (like they don\u2019t make enough money already), the banks, the intermediaries, the event organizers, etc. all the parties involved ask for insane quantity of money. That\u2019s the crypto far west baby, love it or leave it, right? Nope.\n\nThe last ICOs I invested in, I did it through private pre-sales, more and more (if not all) ICOs are giving the opportunity to private, wealthy investors, or pools, to invest with a substantial discount during the private pre-sale phase. If this is, in a way, similar to more traditional form of alternative investments, on the other side is very different and particularly dangerous for the whole ecosystem (if not morally questionable).\n\nWhat usually happens is that, whatever is the official ICO price, once the tokens are released, the price drops quickly in the private pre-sale price zone. I actually know people that do this systematically and professionally, they try to get in the pre-sale, whatever is the project behind they don\u2019t care and dump the tokens on decentralized exchanges as soon as they can with a little (or big) mark up on the ETH invested. They cash out the margin and put the rest in the new pre-sale. Such a trend is so blatantly bad and in so many ways that I will not waste your time explaining why so. The most important effect (financially speaking) is that usually it is more convenient to buy tokens after the initial dump that during the ICO.\n\nSo now let\u2019s get to the proposal. All the investors, private pre-sale, pre-sale, first hour, first week, you name it\u2026 All get at T+0 the same amount of tokens per ETH, all equals. The company will pay the actual discount (more correctly a bonus) in the form of a number of airdrops for all the holders at regular intervals, the sooner the investor entered the deal the higher will be the bonus and the sooner he/she will get it. It is quite simple but I enjoyed myself on the good old PowerPoint to be more clear, I present you the \u201cFair token distribution model\u201d:"

        "text": "Even if gas emissions were reduced to zero, the world would still be stressed & overused beyond the world\u2019s capacity. Over-population is one of the leading problems we will be facing in this century.\n\nThe Tragedy of Over-Population alongside this, could be some of the most pressing challenges we will be facing in the 21st century. Yet, for some reason, Fox News and CNN keep focusing on Trump.\n\nIf we fail to wake up to and manage these challenges directly in time, corporations may derail key elements of the sustainability transition.\n\nAccording to the environmentalist, Paul Hawken, the problem we are facing is not a management problem from corporations, but rather a design problem.\n\nEven the best companies will only be sustainable when the institutions & markets are designed to promote sustainability. The larger systems need to be reformed or redesigned, in other words.\n\nHawken\u2019s solution is not so much for sustainable capitalism to only have environment-friendly technologies, as important as they may be, it is to have markets that promote dematerialization.\n\nThat is one of the many reasons, we should Stop Trusting the Media! Corporations by definition are here to make money and not to save our planet from its major challenges.\n\nWe will need to drastically reform our understanding of social equity, environmental justice, and business ethics. This will require a much better understanding not only of financial and physical forms of capital, but also of natural, human, and social capital.\n\nThere are political and social issues that exceed the power of corporations. Because of these reasons, it will be more difficult for corporations to do business, if they are to appoint sustainability policies which are not maintained by other corporations.\n\nIf corporations are not held accountable by the Government, we may never be able to find a solution to the increasing pollution chain restaurants like McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, & Dairy Queen create on a daily basis.\n\nOne of the solutions to this individualistic approach is Natural Capital.\n\nNatural Capital is a term that is coined by the environmentalist John Elkington. It can be measured as everything that is contributing positively to the ecosystem.\n\nDirectly related to the Natural Capital concept is something called the Triple Bottom Line, also coined by John Elkington.\n\nThe TBP is usually referred to in the context of business accounting which it usually refers to as profit or loss. It is annually recorded, for the most part, at the very bottom line of a statement of revenue or expenses.\n\nEnvironmentalists extend this further to economic, environmental, and social bottom lines as well.\n\nIf we are to take the concept of TBL seriously, we will have to change the basic nature of accounting. Accountants are normally short-sighted, the accounting period is after all 12 months long.\n\nThat is a serious issue, since the challenges we face are not necessarily ours, they are a problem of mostly 3rd world countries and non-human animals. They do not directly affect most of the West \u2014 for the time being.\n\nWe need to first realize that the \u2018balance of nature\u2019 or \u2018web of life\u2019 will be significantly affected, as Elkington puts it.\n\nIn most countries, companies are held accountable for how they affect their environments. With major corporations such as McDonald opening 2,800 restaurants annually, there are major setbacks against corporate capitalism in America.\n\nBy applying the Triple Bottom Line frameworks, a holistic picture is presented which enables the search for greater efficiency, ensuring a competitive environment and sparking innovation, the main factors that drive profits over time.\n\nAs was mentioned above, the components that comprise the TBL, are Economic, Environmental, and Social Accounting all of which have intricate challenges they face, which we will discuss below.\n\nThe field of environmental accounting is steadily growing, yet it is still a relatively new field. There are differences between the three bottom lines and their accounting responsibilities.\n\n. . . Faces its own difficulties over how companies account for acquisitions and disposals, record extraordinary and exceptional items, value contingent liabilities, capitalize costs, and depreciate their assets. It has become more clear that these concepts are open to compromise and are able to be subjected to change over time.\n\n. . . Identifies environmentally related issues into their costs and revenues within their own conventional accounting systems. Many companies are now forced to document their impacts and effects which were once externalized. These accountants are still in their early \u201cembryonic\u201d form, yet the literature seems to be growing.\n\n. . . aims to document and assess the impact of an organization or company on people both inside and outside its domain. This involves, poverty alleviation, population stabilization, female empowerment, employment creation, human rights observance and opportunity on a massive scale.\n\nIf we are to really challenge the world\u2019s lack of awareness on this issue and how to deal with it effectively, Elkington and Hawken argue, we will have to implement these concepts to creating an environment of sustainable development that rewards companies that take care and consider the ecosystem and not just their own bottom line.\n\n\ud83d\udde3Connect with Me on Twitter, or Instagram.\n\nAND If you found this article helpful, click the\n\nbutton below (remember it can go up to 50 claps \u2014 it helps me a lot if you\u2019re generous with that clap button ;) ) or share the article on Facebook/TWITTER if you want your friends to benefit from it in some way at all.\n\nI write to keep you thinking and to keep me thankful and reflective.

        "text": "When it comes to sales entrepreneurs and salespeople often have the wrong end game in mind.\n\nTheir focus is on closing deals. And if in a startup, their end game is to close those deals as quickly as possible to develop enough momentum to convince investors to back them at the next financing round.\n\nThis is the right thing to do for the time. Well, sort of.\n\nWhen a startup cracks to sales code for their target market, sales processes can scale and that means much-needed revenue can be generated.\n\nThe only issue is that most sales operations that have this endgame in mind (scaled or not), leave value on the table.\n\nThe punchline is that they miss out, forget about or de-prioritise the final step of selling: Turning each new customer into an advocate.\n\nWord-of-mouth marketing is born at this step.\n\nI think about it like this: Close a deal means you get paid. Closing a deal and turning a new customer into an advocate instantly increases the likelihood of another sale.\n\nI use two principles to create customer advocates. They are grounded in genuine concern for the success of my customer because I know my success and that of my company is inextricably linked to my customer\u2019s success.\n\nThe first principle is to go all-in on after sales service. The objective is to make customers so overwhelmed with prompt and convenience-rich service that they can\u2019t help but talk about you and your product. In practice this means:\n\nThe second principle is more an accidental habit. I enjoy learning about the people with whom I do business. And I know that work is one part of life and for most of us, there is family and also a hobby, interest or side-hustle.\n\nI invest time asking questions to learn about these things. Because while the product we\u2019re discussing is interesting and will no-doubt create value, there is always more to life.\n\nMany salespeople won\u2019t reach out to wish a customer happy birthday, send them a YouTube video about their hobby that will make them smile or offer to connect them with another relationship that might add a new dimension of value to their life.\n\nI do because I enjoy it. And because it\u2019s essential to building trust and sustaining relationships.\n\nA great example of these principles in action is WorkInc, the company that operates inkl\u2019s Sydney office.\n\nThe Saturday before I officially joined inkl I needed to find an office. At 7:30 am on the following Monday I called the three co-working spaces I had researched on the weekend. Only one had a mobile phone number on their website.\n\nThe first one didn\u2019t answer (and did not have a voicemail service)\n\nThe second one didn\u2019t answer (but I left a message)\n\nThe third one had a mobile number on their website. I SMS\u2019d the number and outlined my needs.\n\nFour minutes later I had a reply and by 8:45 am on the same day I was in an office. By 9:00 am I could access Wi-Fi, 24/7 fingerprint access was sorted and I was joining the daily standup.\n\nDuring that week Tom, the General Manager, took me for coffee to learn more about inkl. He also learned about my side hustle and offered to find me a place to record my podcast.\n\nI became a huge advocate for WorkInc and have introduced a number of new customers to Tom as a result.\n\nAs I was writing this post and thinking about customer advocates I was asked why people are afraid of working in sales.\n\nStarting in sales is an obvious precursor to growing in sales and creating customer advocates.\n\nSo why are people afraid of working in sales?\n\nI think there are four reasons.\n\nFirst, they have never been shown how to create value for another person or experienced the exhilaration when that person appreciates that value.\n\nSecond, they are scared of being told no.\n\nThird, they haven\u2019t found something they would love to sell.\n\nFourth, they equate being in sales as being a used car, snake oils salesman.\n\nLook back on the last time you did something for a friend, colleague or family member that genuinely helped them.\n\nTheir reaction was genuine, one of surprise and gratitude.\n\nYou might have saved them time, moved them further away from fear or closer to happiness.\n\nThey may or may not have expected it but it was you who did it.\n\nThis is the heart of great sales.\n\nYou will always hear more No than Yes in sales.\n\nNo of it is personal and there will be factors you can see and those you can\u2019t which influence a \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019.\n\nSales can be a grind and it\u2019s made more difficult when your expectations are unrealistic. I expect on my run rate business to be told \u2018No\u2019 200 times for every \u2018Yes\u2019. I expect to hear No 50 times for every yes on strategic deals.\n\nDoes it play out that way?\n\nBut the mindset is important to help push through the grind.\n\nIf you\u2019re not 110% bought into the product you\u2019re selling, stop selling it and move on.\n\nAnd don\u2019t mistake fatigue for not loving the product. We all get tired. The grind takes its toll.\n\nBUT if you stand up a little taller and talk a little faster when you\u2019re pitching the product, no matter how tired you are, you still love the product.\n\nAnd show up the next day.\n\nI wrote about how I felt when a manager first told me I thought I was a sales guy. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say I freaked out.\n\nMany people hold onto the persona of a used car, snake oils salesman as what salespeople are like.\n\nThe best salespeople are focused on their customer\u2019s long-term success and doing whatever is necessary to turn them into their advocates.\n\nBecause their success depends on it.\n\nYou will find these 8 characteristics in the best salespeople:\n\nThe best online course I\u2019ve ever done to brush up on sales tactics was created by Scott Britton. You can find it on Udemy here.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for sales coaching from one of the best in the business, reach out to Sidney Minassian at Sales Native.\n\nI highly recommend both resources and I hope they help."

        "text": "It was the summer of 2011 and I was sipping an iced coffee on the patio of my local coffee shop in Montreal.\n\nI was finishing up my last two courses at McGill University. Everyone was heading their separate ways \u2014 my roommates were heading back home to Europe and my favourite colleagues back to various parts of the U.S.\n\nI had no idea what I was going to do after I graduated. I had no connections, no job prospects, and no idea how I was going to get my proverbial foot in the door. I had just turned 21-years old and the only work experience that coloured my resume were minimum wage jobs: grocery stores, coffee shops, clothing stores, you name it.\n\nWhile it seemed that most of my colleagues were heading off to work entry-level positions in finance, politics or some other impressive-sounding industry, I felt like I had nothing. Why couldn\u2019t I have these connections that everyone else had?\n\nI started searching non-profit organizations on the internet and I came across one unfamiliar to me. The organization\u2019s mission was to target schools in Quebec who had high drop-out rates, and implement various projects and programs to boost student engagement. Without skipping a beat, I applied for a position. There was just one catch: the school was in a remote Cree community about 9\u201310 hours north of Montreal.\n\nA month later, I was elated when I found out I landed the job. My friends, family, and then-girlfriend all thought I was crazy for accepting the position. But it was the first time that I would be earning more than minimum wage, and my compensation package even included a northern allowance, room and board, and a discretionary expense account to fund whatever projects I wanted to implement. I never had so much responsibility before.\n\nAs the van carrying me and my two future roommates (also carefree enough to accept such a position) pulled on to the highway with the Florence + Machine\u2019s Ceremonials blaring through the speakers, a hundred questions raced through my mind: What did I get myself into? Am I even qualified for this job? Will the students respect me? Will I make meaningful connections with anyone? Will I cry myself to sleep each night, overcome with loneliness? Will this job impress law school admissions committees?\n\nThe next six months came and went in a blink of the eye.\n\nI started an after-school tutoring program. I created the first student-run newspaper in the community. I played soccer with staff and students. I was invited to potlucks put on by school staff. I adventured to the nearest town \u2014 over an hour away if you drive fast and there are no moose on the roads\u2014 with some colleagues, so we could eat at different restaurants and throwback a few drinks. Students showed up to my house and invited me to play ball hockey with them. The community embraced me with open arms, despite my outsider status.\n\nA new part of myself emerged \u2014 a side I didn\u2019t know existed.\n\nAs a stubborn city girl born and raised in Toronto, a small town would be the last place I assumed I\u2019d flourish. The town had one restaurant, one grocery store, one gas station, and a few stores that I could count on one hand. It also took the telecom company a month to install internet in our home, and during that time I walked 20 minutes to the town lodge to use their internet so I could e-mail my family, Skype with my girlfriend, and, most urgently, submit my law school application.\n\nBut despite all that, I was never bored nor deprived.\n\nThree months after I returned \u201csouth\u201d (a.k.a. Toronto), a small envelope with my name on the front arrived at my house. With shaky hands, I tore it open to read a handful of words that would define the next chapter of my life: I had been accepted to my first choice law school. I cried. I laughed. I thanked the nebulous big man upstairs.\n\nIn that moment, I learned a valuable life lesson that now orients my entire working career: The road less travelled will still end at the destination that you wanted. There is no \u201cright\u201d way to get where you want to go. Everything can come together as you want it, on your own terms.\n\nSo, why bother trying to replicate what everyone else does?\n\nNow, almost six years to the very date of that letter, I earn a living doing what perfectly aligns with my purpose. Steering away from corporate law, I help low-income workers at a legal aid clinic. I advocate when their employment and human rights are infringed. I participate in community organizing. I represent poor and working-class earners before the labour board and the human rights tribunal. I don\u2019t earn six-figures, but I earn more than enough.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see someone else doing what you want to do \u2014 do it yourself. When you find the traditional path unappealing, pave your own."

        "text": "I\u2019m a Type-A person. I do my best with everything I do. But sometimes I channel it to the wrong things.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be fast with everything; you just have to do the right things. I always need to remind myself that there\u2019s a big difference between the two.\n\nMe and my wife are starting our entrepreneurial journey and I am documenting the lessons we\u2019re learning. We are lifelong employees and the skills we\u2019ve learned there are not transferrable into entrepreneurship.\n\nAs workers, we are given instructions on what it is we need to do. And we need to make sure to do it fast. An employee is gauged by his efficiency.\n\nIt\u2019s different when you become your own boss. You need to tell yourself what needs to be done. I\u2019ve always thought my bosses were chumps because they\u2019re not the one executing, but now I appreciate the effort it takes to decide what priority takes precedence.\n\nWhat\u2019s the milestone for the week? For today? For the month?\n\nAnd I continue to choose the low hanging fruit every time. I choose the easiest tasks rather than focusing on the hardest and most important ones.\n\nThis is what we\u2019re going through right now \u2014 we want to build an Amazon business. We want to create private labels and sell them on Amazon. But instead of working on product research and learning how to design and customize products, I find myself spending more time learning how to create an LLC, do my books or file my taxes.\n\nThose things are important. But you can spend money to solve them \u2014 hire someone to do it for you. This will save you time and energy for other things. They will remove the guesswork and you will understand it faster.\n\nLet\u2019s remind ourselves that the most important task is making money.\n\nYou can\u2019t do everything. Learn how to delegate other tasks and concentrate on making money. There\u2019s no use in learning how to handle your books or taxes if you don\u2019t have profits.\n\nMake a profit and figure out the rest as you go along.\n\nTalk to you soon my friend."

        "title": "Validating Multiple Productized Service Ideas At Once",
        "text": "What in the world is a productized service business? Well, according to Wikipedia, it\u2019s called Service as a product (SaaP). Everything needs an acronym. There\u2019s a lot of confusion around the idea but it\u2019s very simple: You do something for someone in a packaged service for a monthly recurring fee. See ManyPixels and DesignPickle for reference.\n\nMany Pixels was launched in 5 hours based on a problem the founder had seen recurring over and over. 2 months later, they are set to make $50,000 in MRR.\n\nSide Note: I\u2019m not a fan of reporting Monthly Recurring Revenue. It bothers me because revenue isn\u2019t what you actually make. It\u2019s what you take in. I prefer to report NIAT which is income after all taxes and expenses have been taken out. Basically\u2026this is what you actually make and keep.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of SaaP because it scales well and you can deliver high quality work to solve real problems. Now the key is finding real-world problems to solve and then getting your idea out in the world quickly.\n\nThis sets up a dilemma. Some say, \u201cDon\u2019t do MVP\u2019s.\u201d Some say, \u201cDo MVP\u2019s but don\u2019t call them MVP\u2019s.\u201d Some other experts say, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything until you know that users will pay for your solution.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma that exists is that there is just too many opinions and to be honest, it will work anyway it will work for different scenarios and people and problems being solved. No model is the right model because everyone has an idea of how one will work and the other won\u2019t.\n\nThere is ONE thing that works: Get your idea out there and don\u2019t waste a bunch of time. Drive traffic. Watch your analytics. If you get feedback, then listen and readjust your idea quickly. Be nimble. If no one wants to pay for this, then there may not be product/market fit. Move on or keep at it and hope to find that fit (not recommended for everyone).\n\nI have failed so many times at all of this so I\u2019m not claiming to be an expert but I can say what I am trying.\n\nI have a few ideas that I have written down in Evernote. I follow this format:\n\nSo I start with a problem and then write down the details of those questions. Right now I have about 4 such ideas.\n\nBut since I do not really know which idea will fly and since I don\u2019t have all the time in the world to validate each one individually, I\u2019m going to try to validate them all at the same time.\n\nHere\u2019s how I do this right now. If I\u2019m missing something feel free to add anything in the comments but here\u2019s my approach today:\n\nThis is as far as I have gotten so far and I have 4 of these ready to go. Note that these are NOT businesses yet. They are ideas. They are projects. I had to really get out of my head that I\u2019ve got something when I really don\u2019t have anything yet. All I\u2019m doing is validating.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do next:\n\nReally. It\u2019s that simple. So what happens when an idea has some steam? Well then my focus shifts to that and I do the next set of plans which is to further validate and give it a lot more attention, etc.\n\nI know that many people would warn against this but my whole point to this story is to say that you can do what you want and if you keep listening to all of the opinions and experts\u2026you won\u2019t get anywhere. I\u2019ve fallen into this trap lately and it\u2019s horrible.\n\nLook. The world has changed from the way it was even a year ago. Startup rules aren\u2019t even the same from day to day because we have so many resources at our fingertips.\n\nThere is one thing that has not changed. If you do not start somewhere and even put up a landing page and drive traffic or whatever your method is to get feedback, then you will never know or experience both success or failure. Just start and if you are stuck, let me know because I know how you feel and perhaps I can help you move forward."

        "text": "This is the single thing that helps me the most. When it\u2019s still time for me to work, then I throw myself at work. No matter how bad the stuff is I am producing, I just focus on getting something done.\n\nThe goal here is not to produce your best work ever.\n\nIts to break your pattern of anxiety.\n\nWhile it may take longer than usual, I eventually enter flow state. In case you haven\u2019t heard about it yet, flow is the state during which you forget everything else around you, and focus 100% of your attention on your task.\n\nAthletes refer to it as \u2018being in the zone\u2019. And one thing is for sure \u2014 you definitely have experienced it many times before. It happens, when you are completely absorbed in what you are doing.\n\nThe great thing about flow is, that it also makes you forget all your anxieties and worries.\n\nOf course, that only is true while you are still in the flow state. Once you are no longer in the zone, they may return quickly.\n\nWhat if its not your working time any longer?\n\nFor me, my anxiety mostly is at its peak, when I finished my working time for the day. Since I now have the time to think about other stuff, often this ends up with me checking my stats more and, consequently, worrying more.\n\nThe answer is simple and obvious:\n\nYou still do your best to enter flow state. Its just that you do it in a different way than through work. The basic requirement for this is that you have a hobby. One, that is conducive to entering flow state.\n\nThis could be anything that requires a large degree of skill and attention from you.\n\nI have noticed a large improvement in my levels of anxiety since I started playing the keyboard in my spare time. When I start practicing, I quickly become so absorbed in it, that I quickly forget my anxieties and worries.\n\nI also use this hobby of mine in a very purposeful manner. Whenever I start checking my stats too much, or generally become too anxious, I start playing the keyboard.\n\nWhat activities could work for you?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of activity it is. As long as it puts you into action mode and allows you to become completely absorbed in the activity itself, it will make you forget about your anxieties."

        "text": "Six weeks ago, I published a post about measuring the success of my blog and email newsletter with growth metrics. Since then, I\u2019m obsessed with numbers and dived deep into my stats.\n\nI published several posts about the lessons I learned from my stats. Here are some highlights.\n\nThese and many others helped me reach a bigger audience, express myself better, and get more responses. That\u2019s why I say \u201cdata is gold if you know how to use it.\u201d\n\nData is extremely useful, but it can also be extremely distracting. If I\u2019d dive into Google Analytics, I could spend months on it without adding any value to my blog. That\u2019s an obvious pitfall of using data.\n\nThere\u2019s a less obvious pitfall. That is focusing on the numbers at the expense of what can\u2019t be measured. That\u2019s a subtle pitfall.\n\nMake no mistake. I don\u2019t downplay the importance of numbers. At the end of the day, we all have bills to pay and bills are paid by numbers. But focusing solely on numbers can backfire in the long term.\n\nIn a previous post, I argued that my about page wasn\u2019t that important. It only accounted for 2% of the page views of my blog.\n\nWhen I was writing my post the next day, I changed my mind. The about page might be critical. Its 2% page views might come from the most enthusiastic readers. By not having an up-to-date about page, I might be missing an opportunity.\n\nWhat Can\u2019t Be Measured Is Equally Important\n\nNumbers are important, but what can\u2019t be measured is equally important. On the one hand, we have quantitative analysis, and on the other hand qualitative analysis.\n\nI think this all comes down to short term vs. long term. Numbers are great at optimizing short term results.\n\nIf short term and long term goals contradict with each other, I prefer long term goals.\n\nAs I explained in my post, Quick Cash vs. Long Term Value, I made zero dollars from my blog so far. I experimented a few weeks with Steemit and already started to make money on that platform.\n\nIf I looked at the numbers, working on Steemit seemed to be better than working on my blog.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I quit Steemit in order to focus on my blog. Steemit didn\u2019t seem to be a sustainable business model. The lifetime potential of my blog seemed to be greater than the potential of Steemit.\n\nIf I needed some cash in the short term, I\u2019d keep working on Steemit. I don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I skipped the quick cash.\n\nThe Right Tools for the Right Goals\n\nIt\u2019s important to use the right tools for the right goals. Some tools are more suitable to optimize qualitative goals. Others are more suitable to optimize quantitative goals.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I published a post about commenting on Medium. In that post, I argue that commenting on Medium doesn\u2019t boost one\u2019s number of followers. I received a lot of responses to that post. My readers argued about the benefits of commenting.\n\nI agree that commenting has a lot of benefits.\n\nAll of those benefits are qualitative benefits. If you use commenting for its qualitative benefits, you\u2019re going to act different than if you use it for its quantitative benefits.\n\nIf you comment for its qualitative benefits, you\u2019ll take your time to understand the post, and you\u2019ll comment to add something to the discussion, including asking a question.\n\nIf you comment for its quantitative benefits, you\u2019ll read a few paragraphs of a post, quickly jot down a few sentences, and repeat that for dozens of posts every day.\n\nGuess which one would be more effective?\n\nQuantitative Goals Might Not Match the Nature of Reality\n\nAnother pitfall of using statistics is that we make linear plans. My weekly 10% growth goal is a typical example of this. Most of the time, life doesn\u2019t work like that. Growth comes in spikes after long periods of plateaus (Fig.1).\n\nAs I have written in a previous post, it took me 55 blog posts to get published in the Startup Publication. 17 of those posts have 0 views to this date, 12 only 1, and 7 only 2.\n\nYou can measure some factors, but you can\u2019t measure others. If you can\u2019t measure a factor, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an unimportant one.\n\nHonesty, relationships, and karma can\u2019t be measured. Yet, they play a critical role in success.\n\nTake into account quantitative analysis to optimize your business, but not at the expense of qualitative analysis."

        "text": "My Personal Brand Is Eating Cheerios And Drinking Orange Juice\n\nWe are living in a current society where everyone is telling everyone else how to be successful. They\u2019re throwing out pink and purple T-Shirt inspirational stuff that makes my head ring so loud that I tripped over a box this morning (for the second time this week).\n\nNot only that, I was reading an article written by the great Jon Westenberg last night and he nailed down what is going on so perfectly that I went across the street and ate a salad at California Pizza Kitchen. Some people\u2019s writing I just can\u2019t sit there and read because I get too excited. I have to go run outside and do something.\n\nBut it got me thinking about all this \u201cPersonal Brand\u201d talk and how current millennial and oncoming generation Z is sitting in front of all the social media platforms and scratching their heads (some of them) over something creative to put out into the world. They\u2019re stuck.\n\nBefore we get to a bit of Westenberg insight let me tell you something about creativity.\n\nThe best thing you could post or write or youtube about is that moment you are sitting at your computer trying to figure out what to post. Know why? Because that\u2019s YOU. Thats the real you in your real self. And thats what people care about. That\u2019s what they respond to. That\u2019s what they connect to. There\u2019s only one of you in that moment. Treasure it.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve put out plenty of cotton candy columns \u201cFeel Good\u201d columns in my day. They do serve a purpose and I\u2019m sure inspire some people.\n\nBut I want to be real with you guys. I\u2019m a human with thoughts, goals, dreams, ambition, curiosity and most importantly\u2026flaws. Just like anyone.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid of sharing any of this. My front porch has a BBQ that\u2019s been sitting out there for 2 years because we never used it at the Los Angeles Rams tailgating. There\u2019s dishes in the sink. My desk is in the middle of my living room. I have nothing in my refrigerator except 3 beers, coffee creamer, and ketchup. My current addictions are birthday cake flavored Quest Bars, oatmeal from Starbucks and this health bowl titled \u201cThe Funky Monkey\u201d they make at a nearby trendy LA bowl place (what are those places called?).\n\nI\u2019m probably the only maniac in the nation that walks into movie theaters, buys popcorn, and leaves.\n\nThe thing is, we live in a world that pushes for fame. We post photos of our \u201cbest self\u201d. We always try to look, act, and be a million bucks. And it\u2019s sad. All the bloggers are giving us ways to stand out in the world and we think that we have to look perfect and create something that will send everyone to Mars in a year.\n\nThe reality is, what if what really impresses people is not all of that but merely the act of being ourselves?\n\nI feel like often times the people pushing all the \u201cservice to others\u201d part miss the important first piece. The car ignition can\u2019t start if you don\u2019t have the keys.\n\nSo who are you?????????\n\nIt goes beyond your raw too. So many people think that because a person is famous that is the pinnacle of it all. That we all must strive for that.\n\nWe\u2019re trained to think that we have to stand out. That we have to do something special to be special!\n\nRegie of Regie\u2019s blog wrote a brilliant column recently in which he discusses how we live in a society that feels they are suppose to be famous.\n\nWhat defines your personal brand is simply your ability to connect to your own mess. When you do that, things start to happen in your life.\n\nLet me tell you a secret. What makes people famous (and gives them a \u201cbrand\u201d) is they weren\u2019t trying to be famous. They were connected with who they were and living moment to moment. That\u2019s why we had movie stars emerge nearly a century ago. Ask any acting teacher on Sunset Boulevard and they\u2019ll tell you great acting is the ability to live in the present moment with a set of circumstances and have a point of view. Stars in turn for better or worse became \u201cbrands\u201d.\n\nLet me give you an example rooted in truth. Jennifer Lawrence is a massive movie star. Here\u2019s a moment that gives a little insight into why she found success. Most might not have seen this or paid a lot of attention on first glance. It\u2019s small, but profound. Little things can make a huge difference.\n\nMy God she loves her pop rocks. A huge lesson in this small moment. This is The Oscars. We\u2019re suppose to be talking about who we are wearing and what we\u2019re nominated for. Lawrence nearly passes out at the sight of pop rocks.\n\nHer reaction to Poprocks at the Oscars is sublime.\n\nSo with all this branding talk rather than think you have to make or create something, first think about what makes you, you. And do that. Do you. Live in your mess.\n\nFind your Poprocks. That\u2019s where the magic is.\n\nSee you soon.\n\nYou can connect with me at: www.geoffreypilkington.com"

        "text": "I remember in my twenties chasing the American dream. I went to college to get a degree in marketing. I got married and had 2.3 kids (or 4). I got a great job and was quickly promoted up the company ladder. I bought nice cars and a nice house. I bought an airplane. I lived in Switzerland for a year, then moved to Singapore for a year. I had it made.\n\nGrowing up, I always thought I was going to die when I was 33. I\u2019m not sure why, that feeling was just always there. When I was 33 years old, I bought a new motorcycle. Three days later, I totaled it coming down a canyon. I thought I was dead, but I didn\u2019t die.\n\nAfter a couple years of depression and self-implosion, I realized that I had a second chance at life so I thought I\u2019d spend some time to figure out what I really wanted. As I was studying the fusion of science and spirituality, I ran across the Buddhist concept of non-attachment. It was then I realized that in order to really find myself, I had to let go of who I wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last sixteen years figuring this out. I still have a long way to go, but I\u2019ve found something that is working for me.\n\nBefore we can let go of these things, we get to define the who that is letting go. Who are we, really? This is the insight that shifted everything for me. This insight has grown over the past several years through meditation and mindfulness.\n\nSome people call it the soul, spirit, higher self, things like that. I\u2019d like to refer to it as The Observer. The Observer is our true self that observers our thoughts, emotions, and programs. The Observer is the one driving around our bodies, like we drive around our cars.\n\nBeing present and creating awareness through meditation and mindfulness allow us to create separation between the Observer and all of these other things that we have thought are us, but are merely tools that we\u2019ve collapsed onto ourselves.\n\nWhen we recognize who we are, then we can recognize who we are not. When we realize that these things are not us, we can choose to let them go. Here are ten things we can let go of to discover who we really are.\n\nOur brain wants to keep us safe. That\u2019s its job, so it helps us feel safe by giving us the illusion of control. We like to categorize things, put them in boxes, and believe that we have some sort of control in our lives.\n\nWhen we think about it, what control do we really have? Do we know with absolute certainty that we won\u2019t die tomorrow? Do we have any control of the economy? Do we have any control of how our boss is going to act when we show up at work?\n\nSure, there are many things that we can direct, and maybe even control, but they are things within our sphere of influence. Spending less than you earn is a great example of this. The one thing we can control is our response to whatever happens in our lives.\n\nOur attachment to the need to know everything stems from our fear of the unknown or change. The brain wants us to believe that change is unsafe, so it\u2019s created this fear. What\u2019s funny is that change is the only constant. If you\u2019re not progressing, you\u2019re regressing, or you\u2019re dead.\n\nWhen we learn to embrace change, and learn to be okay with not knowing, we create more freedom in our lives. We lift this huge burden of having to know, and realize that it\u2019s okay not knowing everything.\n\nMany of us get some of our validation from our looks or how smart we think we are. When we shift our perspective to believe that we\u2019re driving around our body and that our brain is just a great supercomputer that we can use, it allows us to treat them as servants and not as masters.\n\nOur brain has the tasks of keeping us safe and making us efficient. The downside of this is that it fabricates so much fear to keep us safe that it keeps us small. It creates fear of change, fear of the unknown, fear of what others think, and many others. When we realize that these fears are made up, we can acknowledge them and lean into them and do the things we fear anyway. This provides vast amounts of freedom.\n\nWe HAVE emotions. We are NOT our emotions. They are also just tools. They are not good or bad, like a smartphone or car are not good or bad. It\u2019s how we choose to use them.\n\nWe can do one of three things with thoughts and emotions; we can attach to them (which amplifies them), we can act on them, or we can let them go.\n\nWhen we learn to seperate from and observe our thoughts and emotions, we are in a place of power to decide to use them or to let them go.\n\nAn opinion is a point of view based on our experience. It is not right or wrong, it\u2019s simply our perspective. Too many times, we believe our opinions are truth, and so we fight to defend them, especially if they are drastically different from someone else.\n\nWhen we can be less attached to our opinions, it opens us up to better understand a differing opinion. It allows us to expand our perspective, instead of being narrowly attached to our current point of view.\n\nThere are differing definitions of ego. For me, our ego is a made-up character, based on what we inherited in life, and our experiences. We also have different aspects of our ego. Our ego-character at work is probably different from the one at home.\n\nNormally, we feel the need to protect our ego, this made up character. We think that it is us that we are protecting, but it\u2019s not. When we can see our ego as separate from our true selves, we can practice non-attachment to it.\n\nNearly all fear is made up, and is based on the future. Think about it. Danger is real, but fear is optional. We have a common fear of what other people think of us, but we don\u2019t really know what anybody thinks of us unless they tell us.\n\nFear is based on some imaginary thing happening in the future. I can\u2019t read the future. Why do I think that my brain can?\n\nWhen we realize that fear is an automated response from the amygdala in the brain, and that it\u2019s fabricated, it makes it easier to let fear go when it raises its ugly head.\n\nDid any of us receive a formal education in love? No. Where did we learn about it? From imperfect models; our parents, family and friends as we were growing up. If I was raised in an abusive home and you were raised in a loving home, our experiences of love would be drastically different.\n\nMost of what we see in movies and on TV isn\u2019t a very good example of love either.\n\nThe Greeks have four different words for love. The highest form is agape, or unconditional love. This form of love is a motivation, and may or may not have emotion attached to it. The best way that I can explain agape is that it is acceptance and understanding of ourselves and others.\n\nUnconditional love means that I love you because of who I am, not because of who you are.\n\nAgape love is the antidote for fear. We cannot come from love and fear at the same time. As we choose to really learn about what love is, we find out who we really are.\n\nIn his book \u201cPower Versus Force\u201d, David Hawkins states that different emotions have different vibrational frequencies. Blame, guilt, and shame rate at very low frequencies, while emotions like love and gratitude have high frequencies.\n\nGuilt and shamme do not serve us, and are primarily focused on our past. We cannot change our past, so why would we want to carry the emotional baggage of guilt and shame? Learning to love all of who we are means accepting that we\u2019re not perfect and that we make mistakes. There is no benefit for carrying these heavy emotions.\n\nLabels and judgments divide. They are fear-based. They create an energetic resistance around them. They also box us or others in. They tell us who we should be, based on a category. Labels and judgments seem to be black and white, then in reality, there is a whole lot of gray in between.\n\nWhen we let go of labels and judgments and accept things and people for how they are, we eliminate the division and resistance.\n\nIf I could summarize all of this, it is to surrender to what is. It is being mindful, being the nonjudgmental present observer. It is practicing non-attachment to our thoughts, emotions, bodies, brains, opinions, egos, fears and the other things mentioned.\n\nThe best way to find out who we really are is to let go of who we are not. It\u2019s the cutting away of who we thought we were that allows our true being to shine through, uncluttered, untethered and free.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about finding out who you really are and enjoying more peace, power and purpose, you can download my FREE ebook \u201cA Practical Guide for the Closet Hippie\u201d."

        "text": "Lately, the term \u201cdisruption\u201d is often used, and misused.\n\nIn the business community, disruption is used to describe economic transformations, changes to consumer path-to-purchase, shifts toward digital consumption, the \u201cretail apocalypse,\u201d and jobs lost.\n\nAt our factory in Central America, disruption takes on a deeper meaning.\n\nHonduras is a country often disrupted by devastating hurricanes. These are tremendous and destructive storms that knock out bridges, create landslides and paralyze the region.\n\nBridges are a critical lifeline for early responders, evacuation, and supply-chain.\n\nIn response to a great need, some of the world\u2019s greatest architects gathered in Honduras to plan and build a bridge like no other \u2014 one that would stand up to the worst hurricanes.\n\nThese experts studied every known materials tolerance, under every foreseeable stress. They reviewed reams of historical metorlogical and construction data, analyzed thousands of \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos of damaged bridges, they studied ground water and gravel composition \u2014 and a bridge was designed, and then built, to withstand a 100-year storm.\n\nThe bridge became the greatest architectural achievement in Honduras, and a point of national pride. Visiting dignitaries were shown the bridge before being escorted to the palace.\n\nAnd, inevitably, the ultimate test arrived shortly after the bridge\u2019s completion when Hurricane Mitch hit Central America \u2014 the most devastating storm in 200 years \u2014 a category-5 hurricane, with sustained winds of nearly 200 miles per hour.\n\nHurricane Mitch dropped over 36 inches of wind-whipped rain on Honduras in less than 12 hours.\n\nIn many ways the architects and engineers were successful.\n\nThe bridge withstood the storm with virtually no damage, an incredible achievement.\n\nThe bridge survived in great shape\u2026 However, the storm moved the river, and wiped out the roads.\n\nPeter Drucker, the famous management consultant, once said,\n\nFor companies and managers with a legacy of success, a reliance on previously-dependable best-practices is a handicap. In times of great disruption, we can\u2019t rely on historical strategies, processes, information or expertise.\n\nIn times of disruption we need new perspectives, new questions, new metrics and new objectives. This paradigm shift is very difficult for long-standing managers and companies.\n\nFor legacy companies radical innovation does not serve current customers, is often highly inefficient, and it disrupts legacy culture and best-practices. For start-ups, disruption is catnip.\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly-evolving business environment\u2026 ask new questions, monitor new performance indicators, and create new practices.\n\nThe Bridge Story, presented by the author at WWD Summit, 2017"

        "text": "You\u2019re not too busy to read fiction. It will make you a better leader and a better person.\n\nThere are no shortage of top book lists on Medium. But whenever I read one of these lists, I am always surprised how they are populated almost exclusively by non-fiction titles.\n\nEven worse, often there is this prevailing idea that people are too busy to read fiction. It is as if consuming more and more self-help books is the key to being successful.\n\nThrow in some spreed reading hacks on top of this, and there is an arms race to see who can consume the most books about online marketing, leadership, starting a business or whatever your goal may be.\n\nNot only are there some diminishing returns here (I mean how many books about online marketing can you read and still be learning something new), but to me this is a huge missed opportunity for personal growth.\n\nOn the other hand, there are countless fiction works that have made deep impressions on my life that I think back to over and over again.\n\nIt is difficult to put into words the value I feel I have gotten out of reading fiction over the years, but here is just a small sample of how it can make you a more thoughtful leader and a better person.\n\nThere is nothing quite like a great novel to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes for a little while. It is very easy in our modern lifestyles to get caught up in our own narrative and to think only of how the events in your own life impact you.\n\nThink of politicians who have no idea what it is like to be someone who has been left behind by the globalized economy or of tech leaders who don\u2019t think twice about harvesting personal data from everyone that comes near their platform.\n\nReading a book like \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d by Ernest Hemingway forces us to feel the deep inner conflict of pride, fear, and suffering that comes with war.\n\nOr there are the John Steinbeck classics \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d and \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d that make you reflect on what it is like to be willing and able to do back breaking work just to get by in life, but to have no opportunity.\n\nGo back as far as the ancient Greek tragedies and you are forced to feel the consequences of the hero\u2019s arrogance and how it comes back to punish them in the end. Yet even more powerful than the words themselves is the realization that people 2,500 years ago grappled with the same types of issues and tough decisions that we have today.\n\nA novel can be a great thought experiment projecting current trends out into the future and give you a glimpse of what it could be like to live in the future we are building today.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to read a work of non-fiction about the future that speaks in aggregate and macro level terms and to come away feeling OK with the decisions and trade-offs you are making today.\n\nThere are countless prescient works about the dystopian dangers lurking if the wrong decisions are made today.\n\n\u201c1984\u201d by George Orwell hammers home what it feels like to live in a totalitarian society with ubiquitous surveillance.\n\n\u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d by Ray Bradbury paints a picture of what it is like to live in a world of censorship and with no critical thought. Books are banned, while all news is delivered in the form of giant television screens. (sound familiar?)\n\nBoth of these force you to experience what day-to-day life would be like in these kinds of societies. You can\u2019t help but think about decisions you\u2019re making today and ask if it is creating the kind of world you really want to live in.\n\nThe personal connection that you feel from living through the author\u2019s words can be 10 times more motivating than any self-help book.\n\nReading a novel like Nikos Kazantzakis\u2019 \u201cZorba the Greek\u201d will drive home what it feels like to really live life for today and to take advantage of all of the opportunities that are in front of you to seize the moment.\n\nAnd it hammers home, what can happen if you don\u2019t make the most of these moments and the regrets that you will feel.\n\nIf you are sitting on the fence about something and not sure if you should take that final push, this will surely light more of a fire underneath you than any self-help book can.\n\nNovels give you the ability to truly switch off and become absorbed in someone else\u2019s life for a little while. Unlike the competition to consume more and more non-fiction content, sitting back with a novel is an exercise in mindfulness where you can block out all of your busy thoughts for a few minutes in the day and focus your attention on just that story.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, there is still a time and a place for reading non-fiction. But if that is all you are reading, then you are missing out on a huge opportunity for personal growth.\n\nAnd in this age of people speaking across each other and feeling more and more divided, putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes for a while is something we should all be doing a little more often."

        "text": "\u201cSTOP WASTING YOUR TIME AND GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR!\u201d\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I heard my brain say that to\u2026well me, I\u2019d be so damn rich, like my man, Scrooge McDuck here.\n\nI wish I could tell you right now that I\u2019ve learned how to master and defeat my procrastination but bad news\u2026I\u2019m here to tell you the exact opposite, that I will NEVER stop procrastinating.\n\nThere must be a dozen articles on how to stop procrastinating, and while they have great tips and tricks, sometimes my brain just refuses to listen to their advice, no matter how good it is.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I procrastinate:\n\nObviously, they\u2019re not the true reasons, they\u2019re simply my procrastination tools of choice.\n\nNumber 2 \u2014 I can do it but don\u2019t want to\n\nSo lets talk about them.\n\nIronically, I don\u2019t want to waste time by doing something that (I\u2019m afraid) might not work out.\n\nSo I procrastinate. I avoid the fear and discomfort for as long as I can.\n\nI\u2019ll never stop procrastinating because I\u2019ll always be scared of something and I\u2019ll always want to go back to what makes me feel safe and there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to be safe.\n\nBut eventually (and usually after 3 episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine) I will get up off my ass and make a choice:\n\nDo I want to feel safe or do I want to succeed?\n\nIdeally, I could do both but my brain rarely believes this to be the case.\n\nStepping anywhere outside my comfort zone is a huge red flag and my brain usually tries to shut it down. But there\u2019s only so much TV I can watch before my brain starts turning into mush. Usually after 3 episodes, I will attempt the success route, whatever that means to me on that particular day. The key is to try and not let fear take over.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t achieve what I wanted to on that day, I\u2019ll try again tomorrow; it might just be I was particularly scared that day.\n\nThere are a lot of things I don\u2019t want to do in life:\n\nWhen I\u2019m putting off something I don\u2019t want to do, it usually tells me one of two things:\n\nJust because I suck at something doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do it. If it\u2019s important enough, I\u2019ll take the steps to improve myself to a point where I can, begrudgingly, get the task done. But I know it\u2019s not my strong suit.\n\nNetworking, taxes, the logistics of setting up a decent looking website \u2014not so good at them. But I\u2019ve learned enough that I can get it done.\n\nLets be honest, I\u2019m going to suck at a lot of things. The key is to do it anyway. The more we do it, the more confident we become in ourselves but the more we build up how much we suck in our heads, the more it becomes a reality.\n\nOnce we start, we tend to realize it\u2019s actually not so bad and we might end up loving it, or we might still hate it and put it off until the \u201cPanic Monster\u201d comes in but at least we know we can do it and that\u2019s something.\n\nIf the task sucks and I know how to do it, maybe it\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t be doing anymore.\n\nWe all have goals that we want to accomplish. But are they goals we want for ourselves or are they goals that are expected of us? If the tasks are not essential to our growth, success, or basic quality of life, shouldn\u2019t we do ourselves a favor and re-examine the importance of them?\n\nIf we decide they\u2019re important but the thought of doing them still makes you say \u201cUgh\u201d, there are 3 options:\n\na) Delegate if possible;\n\nb) Break that task into smaller, less daunting tasks; and my usual go-to option\n\nc) Suck it up, put a hard deadline in your calendar, get it done, and reward yourself with a treat after\n\nEither get it done or get rid of it. You decide."

        "title": "Five tips that helped me survive five years of freelancing",
        "text": "d. Educate along the way : I spend time explaining my why and using data and best practice examples as proof points. I create screencasts of my deliverables that serve as a director\u2019s commentary on my work. I send to my clients podcasts, studies, and research that I think they\u2019ll find useful. Why? An educated client is your best client and the more information they have the less likely they are to lean on conjecture and guesswork.\n\nPersonally, I can only take on one \u201cbig client\u201d during a 3\u20136 month time frame, and then I can take on other clients where the workload is no more than 10\u201315 hours a week. For start-up or non-corporate clients, I usually manage two brand projects simultaneously.\n\nc. Manage your time : The hardest part of being a freelancer is establishing your own structure amidst a day without guardrails and routine. Establish a routine. Use productivity tools like Timely, Asana, Google Calendar, and Trello. And, more importantly, be honest about what you can manage, because while I understand the need to squirrel away cash, at one point you will face diminishing returns and your performance will suffer, which will affect your performance and future referrals.\n\nHowever, if the request is a real five-alarm fire (and I better see the blood and bandages), then manage it if you\u2019re available. Your client will be grateful. Remind them that this is a unique, one-off situation but you\u2019re here if the bottom should fall from beneath their feet.\n\nb. Maintain your agreement (because there is the reality of the slippery slope) but be open to flexibility : This is where the discipline comes in and I learned this the hard way. There\u2019s a difference between a client emergency and dialing 911. Be faithful to your office hours because breaking them is dangerous and lets the client know they have carte blanche to contact you 24/7. If the situation is not urgent, kindly remind your client of your terms when you\u2019re back online during office hours. Use your best judgment in determining what\u2019s truly urgent.\n\nI hired a lawyer to manage my vendor agreement from the onset and I\u2019ll use a lawyer for 1\u20132 hours if I\u2019m working off a client\u2019s standard MSA/vendor template, so I\u2019m covered. The Middle Finger Project has incredible resources + adaptable templates created by an attorney who gets the freelance life.\n\na. Be clear about your work arrangement, hours of allocation, and response time for \u201cfires\u201d in your contract . I go through the pain and bloodletting during the contract process. Contracts are critical because you\u2019re negotiating the deliverable, IP, warrants, and all that other nonsense, but you\u2019re also stipulating how you\u2019ll work with the client on the day-to-day, and their expectations on your time. In all my agreements, I define the hours or days allocated to a project, how we\u2019ll mutually manage overages, and I even have clauses about how I\u2019ll manage fires, normal response times on off-hours, and how I can be reached in an emergency.\n\nRight now, I\u2019ve three active clients and they barely know that one another exists and they don\u2019t second-guess my work on the regular. That\u2019s how it should be. Want to know how I got to this place? Simple:\n\nThe fact that you can\u2019t manage your workflow is your fault, not their problem. Educating your client is par for the course and since they hired you to be the expert, it\u2019s incumbent on you to take them through that journey and explain the whys and how\u2019s along the way.\n\nAnd I get it. You need to juggle multiple clients because of the uncertainty of deal flow. You need to save for the drought . Sometimes your clients ask questions that make you want to scream into pillows (Why didn\u2019t this post go viral? Why don\u2019t I have 10 million fans on a $2 budget, etc.) and the time to answer them requires a level of education that\u2019s exhausting. And sometimes you read through your emails think, are you kidding me with this? However, let me be clear about something:\n\nLet me clue you in on a secret: your client doesn\u2019t care about your other clients, obligations, or workload. Clients care about their own problems, and they hired you for solutions.\n\nNothing says you\u2019re not my priority than telling a client you can\u2019t manage their request because you have deliverables\u2026for other clients. I\u2019ve seen scenarios where a freelancer would tell a client they couldn\u2019t answer a question (which was actually a simple one) until the following week. I\u2019ve seen countless instances where people being too transparent with their workload (I\u2019m so slammed with other client work, can I get back to you on this?).\n\nBut for those who have made the leap, it\u2019s important to know that there are nuances in handling client relationships and growing your business. Five tips have helped me over the past five years.\n\nIf only I had a crystal ball that showed me stumbling into a Lyft sobbing over $3000 PER TOOTH in 2016. But hindsight is 20/20 and it\u2019s no way to live.\n\nI only made the leap because I was working for a narcissistic sociopath who drove my self-esteem into the ground while pocketing the millions I made him. At first, I had planned to take a break with the money I hadn\u2019t saved and then start on the painful path of recruiters and first interviews, but then I got one client and another, and since I didn\u2019t need dental surgery in 2013 I thought consulting might be a viable option.\n\nYet, somewhere along the line, office life was vilified, the 9-to-5 employee was depicted as someone who got duped by the system, while the freelancer tapping away in Bali or Venice Beach had discovered the secret to living their best life, complete with Tony Robbins videos, crystals, and colonics.\n\nRegardless of how many millionaires in yoga pants tell you to quit your day job and uproot your life, freelancing isn\u2019t for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. It\u2019s perfectly fine to crave the structure and rhythms of a traditional work environment. For 16 years, I cried on Sundays, swiped key cards, and sat in offices and cubicles and I didn\u2019t mind it. And sometimes I miss comprehensive dental coverage. You try getting a root canal without COBRA. I remember removing the mask that pumped me full of laughing gas and shouting, $3000 PER TOOTH?\n\nOver the five years I\u2019ve been a consultant , I\u2019ve seen it all. From the I can get a kid on Fiverr to build me a brand strategy to the clients who worship at the altar of the Facebook ad fairy, a mythical being that delivers passive income while they sleep. Straight face: I have a budget of precisely $500. Can you build me a million-dollar business by next month? I\u2019ve witnessed freelancers pitching their brand strategy expertise after skimming free eBooks and binging on Gary V videos, which is sort of like performing open-heart surgery after having watched The Discovery Channel.\n\nConsulting is not a one-size-fits-all approach. A few years ago, I bemoaned a client to a friend and peer. I prattled on about how my startup client wasn\u2019t doing things the right way, they skimped on the essentials of branding and marketing, to which my friend responded that I was doing the equivalent of fitting a square peg in a round hole. She said startups don\u2019t have the time, luxury, or money to do everything according to plan, and I have to rethink my approach and focus on the essentials. Deliver that which is truly essential for a business that\u2019s lean, but agile. This isn\u2019t about a textbook definition of what\u2019s right; rather it\u2019s about what\u2019s right for this particular client. Being flexible in your approach will save you big.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the term, ad nauseum: the riches are in the niches. As soon as a term gets popular I develop an allergy toward it, but there\u2019s a kernel of truth in specialization. While I\u2019m capable in many aspects of marketing, I don\u2019t necessarily like the things I\u2019m good at (i.e. social media marketing, influencer management, etc.) Over the past three years, I\u2019ve worked solely with start-ups to mid-sized companies on brand strategy, development, and messaging. So much so that I\u2019ve got a tight process flow and the expertise in knowing what works and where I can save time and money.\n\nMy friend\u2019s advice has remained with me. What I would deliver to a billion dollar electronics giant would be markedly different than my deliverable to a start-up clothing brand. Usually, the latter is leaner, tighter and execution-heavy. Yes, there\u2019s strategy in both but the strategy for an established brand or business is demonstrably different than the needs of a burgeoning brand, whose positioning and value proposition may change over the course of refining their product or service.\n\nWhile I mostly work with smaller companies, I\u2019ve learned that I have to adapt my approach by client, size, and industry.\n\nBe prepared to be a consulting chameleon. Assess your client\u2019s objectives, evaluate their resources and budget, and deliver what works best for them now, even if it\u2019s a phased approach. I LOVE a phased approach because it gives me the flexibility to add and refine over time while offering the client a more risk-averse approach (and they can see your BIG THINKING!). All too often I see startup founders shake their head when reviewing a proposal, with a that\u2019s nice, but that\u2019s not really feasible when I\u2019m still trying to get my product in shape.\n\nIn short, be flexible, be malleable. Realize when you\u2019re fitting square pegs into round holes.\n\nNo one believes in getting paid on time more than I do. If you expect me to deliver at a specified time, I expect to be compensated for my work at a specified time. However, we live in the real world not an imaginary one, and sometimes in this world people in accounts payable go on vacation, people forget to submit your invoice for processing or the direct deposit might take forever and a day to set up properly. Give your client the benefit of the doubt and don\u2019t roll in acting like a collection agency if your check is under 5 days late. Client service was invented for a reason, people.\n\nWhile I establish late fees in my contract (usually when payment is over 30 days), I also specify and negotiate payment terms in my agreements. I start with a 50% project deposit, payable upon contract execution \u2014 the remainder of the payment comes on delivery. For some clients, payments may be cut up into thirds aligning with milestones, but typically get as much cash up front because you never know. Also, in my experience, I\u2019ve found that the larger the client, the longer the payment terms.\n\nI don\u2019t get out of bed for less than N30.\n\nAfter I invoice my client, I wait 5\u20137 days after the payment due date before I send notes of inquiry because I try to exercise the belief that most people have good intentions and want to pay for the work you\u2019ve delivered. And while I\u2019ll send out the troops for clients who are deadbeats (this is rare), don\u2019t issue the brigade if the payment is a few days late, and exercise compassion for when clients have good reasons for delays.\n\nAlso, while it\u2019s important to track your project hours, don\u2019t get crazy over every billable hour. I\u2019ve used Timely to understand the typical time I spend on a project. When you\u2019re a freelancer, you\u2019re the accountant, admin, project manager, etc., so tracking time is important to determine if you\u2019re making money or if you have an unprofitable hobby. I use the time to determine my project rate (I don\u2019t bill hourly because that penalizes pros) as well as how much I need to make per month in order to be sustainable. Check out this excellent post from Paul Jarvis on pricing.\n\nBut don\u2019t nickel and dime your clients. Scope creep is real and you should communicate to your client when the project is going off the rails or is veering from plan. However, if you\u2019ve got a great client who pays on time and they make one small occasional request, honor it. There\u2019s a difference between doing your client a solid and being taken advantage of.\n\nWhile I have iron-clad agreements and I\u2019m pretty direct when it comes to how, when, where I work, I allow for a degree of flexibility for the times when I know being flexibility is an investment in the relationship and future business. Be smart. Don\u2019t think in the billable moment.\n\nOne of the hardest lessons I\u2019ve had to learn is that you have to be as much invested on your business as in your business. Easier said than done, right? I get it. Who wants to be pitching and networking when you have actual work to do? But guess what\u2026\n\nNew business and nurturing your pipeline is part of your work as a creative entrepreneur.\n\nI think of it in terms of planting seeds and tending to your garden. This is all about keeping up with past clients, refreshing your testimonials and case studies, meeting up with peer freelancers over Skype or Zoom (other freelancers are an incredible resource for leads as well as sharing your joys and gripes), and forging non-creepy relationships with people on and off-line.\n\nI\u2019ve made the BIG mistake of not considering my pipeline when I\u2019m the midst of a bountiful few months and then I ended up with weeds in my garden and negative integers in your bank account.\n\nDon\u2019t do this. Set aside time each week to focus on growing your business and maintaining leads.\n\nI\u2019ve created education guides (e.g. social media best practices, worksheets for branding exercises, etc.) that I use as investment products and softsells. Once I\u2019ve established my value with a client, I\u2019ll often send guides that are relevant for their needs/business, with no explicit sell. I\u2019ve done mini education sessions (or the clients have used these guides for internal education), and I\u2019ve almost always secured MORE business because of it.\n\nBe strategic about the sale and offer additional services when you\u2019ve established trust and value, and have some back-pocket tools that you can offer than can bring you closer to a sale.\n\nSo. Not. Sexy. Right? I had a near-coronary moment when I tracked my hours and realized just how efficient I was being managing my admin work. I know, NO ONE WANTS TO TRACK THEIR HOURS but how will you know if you\u2019re being efficient and profitable? I was going by my gut for three years and that was just stupid.\n\nNot only was I reinventing the wheel every time, I was out in the forest chopping wood. There are so many online (and free!) tools that can help you manage everything from your email and scheduling to lead generation and file management. Test and see what works for you and implement that technology into your process.\n\nFor me, I like to keep things simple. I use Google email + calendar, but my clients use Calendly to schedule appointments so we don\u2019t waste ten emails sorting out a meeting time. I use a screencast plugin for Chrome to record any voice-overs for deliverables so I save HOURS on conference calls going through slides. Calls are now about questions and discussion, not deliverable presentation and review. I use Dubsado to track leads and send out contracts, invoices, and automated emails based on dates and specific client actions.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve created a new client magazine. It\u2019s a designed template I purchased off Creative Market and it gives the client EVERY SINGLE THING they need to know when working with me. It includes all the housekeeping (e.g. W9s, payment options, contact info) to hours of communication and file management. I also have three versions of a client questionnaire, which allows me to learn more about their business and ask for assets so I can get started with my work. I also include a timeline in the document that outlines the deliverables but specific actions they need to take against deliverables and approximately how much of their time is needed. Clients LOVE this.\n\nIn the end, you want to design a process that pushes progress. Lock down repetitive emails and tasks into an automated system so you can spend time on the actual work and client relationship.\n\nWhat I love about being a consultant is that there\u2019s never room for complacency. Just when you think you\u2019ve got something figured out, the thing changes shape and form and you\u2019re forced to adapt. You have to keep your skills and technology fresh. You have to nurture your relationships in a real way beyond the exchange of virtual business cards and blog post links. You have to work to cultivate a tribe that will gravitate to your work and vibe and repel those who aren\u2019t getting it."

That\u2019s why many of my friends don\u2019t go on adventures alone when they know full well they could. I think many people are just scared about what\u2019s in front of them: the immediate consequences of traveling when you know nobody.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll have any regrets when I\u2019m older.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even much of a thing nowadays for people to lay in bed sleeplessly at night counting all their travel regrets. Maybe it isn\u2019t. But the way that older people talk to me about chasing dreams, it sure does seem many would do it differently if they could.\n\nI am no Rick Steves or Anthony Bourdain.

Of course you\u2019ll make friends! How did you make friends until this point in your life?\n\nBut guys, both of these realizations still aren\u2019t what\u2019s pushing me to see Southeast Asia this summer.\n\nWhat\u2019s still driving me is the possibility of regret. I do not want to be that person who never saw the world. Time is so precious, more precious than many care to realize. That\u2019s why I\u2019m practically throwing myself out the door."

        "text": "The brain likes these actions and you retain more when the information is alive and moving. It is why we remember stories that we\u2019ve imagined vividly or we see as moving pictures. The power of imagination is undoubtedly strong.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you but when I imagine My Big Green Elephant Has Nice Clean Pajamas, I see a huge green elephant dancing in front me. It\u2019s crazy but my brain likes it.\n\nYour brain is like a mini theatre. It favors information that shows actions. Since it is highly visual, it engages more when there are movements that connect the things you are learning.\n\nSo the next time you want to remember the countries of Central America, do not forget My Big Green Elephant Has Nice Clean Pajamas. Now, see for yourself if it works.\n\nSince the brain is highly visual, you can use strategies like mnemonics. Mnemonics speak the language of the brain. It can create silly, colorful and fun pictures which the brain favors. When you know how to associate names to a particular picture, you increase your chances of remembering them.\n\nOkay, planets are easy to memorize. But try remembering the countries of Central America: Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama. You can probably memorize them easily but would you be able to remember them easily tomorrow?\n\nIf you can associate a vivid image with what you are studying, the more they will stick in your memory. This is why it is easy to remember My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nachos instead of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nThe brain likes to talk in images. It is highly visual and retains more when presented with vivid and clear pictures. In fact, the more exaggerated or illogical the images are, the better it performs.\n\nIn this article, I will share five things to consider when creating your system so you can study smarter and remember essential information.\n\nBut studying and learning are much more than committing facts into memory. Many of us fail to remember important concepts because we don\u2019t tap the brain\u2019s natural way to preserve information. In my post How to Learn Anything Faster , I detailed some ways on how you can actually learn a material efficiently.\n\nRote learning is not a very effective way to remember information for later use because it fails to tap what the brain favors. We\u2019ve all been victims of rote learning. We have been conditioned that we are performing at our best when we can memorize all information. It\u2019s no wonder that our study system focuses on memorizing factual information.\n\nTo create an efficient system, it is important that you know how the brain works. When you know how to tap its potential, you\u2019ll produce quality work. And the quality work will translate into another aspect of your life.\n\nIf you have an efficient system to learn information, you\u2019ll likely to remember them more. You can store this information properly and put them to use when needed.\n\nThat\u2019s how equally frustrating when you want to remember something you\u2019ve studied yet you could not pull it in times of use.\n\nThe brain is comparable to a bookshelf. Imagine walking into a library filled with thousands of books. You are about to borrow a book and the genres are all mixed up together. There are no labels and catalogs to indicate where they are. I bet you would be wasting time looking and end up being frustrated that would prompt you to \u2026 \u201cabort the mission.\u201d\n\nA lot of us probably stood out during those tests but if you try to answer those questions again, you most likely forgot about them.\n\nStudying becomes valuable when you can remember what you\u2019ve learned so you can apply it where you most likely need it. We\u2019ve been trained on rote learning where we repeat the material over-and-over until we remember it so we can correctly answer upcoming exams.\n\nAny memory master would tell you that the key to a great memory is being able to associate new information with what you already know. It\u2019s like letting your neurons find their buddies and once they meet, they instantly click and you just remember them easily.\n\nLook at the concept you are studying and think of another object you can associate with it.\n\nWhat shape, fruit, thing, person or anything that you can connect to recall it later?\n\nWhat other concepts or material can you relate with it?\n\nStudying is important not only in school but when you want to learn something new. If you don\u2019t use the right strategies to remember them, your efforts will go wasted.\n\nAs American neurologist Richard Restak has said:\n\nHere are some ways to help you remember more:\n\nWhen you are studying, most likely you are going to read something. If you fail to create a good system for reading, it\u2019s going to be twice as difficult it is to remember.\n\nBefore reading, make sure that it is clear what you are exactly looking for. Your brain tends to be more alert when it has something to focus on. It\u2019s not like going into a room and asking yourself, \u201cWait, why am I here?\u201d\n\nWhen you know your purpose for reading, you can develop a strategy that best fits that purpose.\n\nFor example, my reading strategy varies depending on my objective. I do speed reading when I want to get general information or I feel like the book overlaps with another material I\u2019ve already read. I read at my regular pace when reading my devotional materials, important stuff that requires deep processing or anything that I want to simply savor and enjoy.\n\nWhen you have a clear target, you\u2019ll have a clear roadmap on how to get there. If you are studying without clear targets, you are like a boat without a rudder \u2014 directionless and unmoored. Like what Bill Copeland said, \u201cThe trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and never score.\u201d\n\nThe brain has a tendency to get bored. Have you ever experienced reading something and you\u2019ve managed to reach the last paragraph but you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve read?\n\nYour mind wanders somewhere because it got bored. One way to prevent this is to have an on-going interaction with the material while you are studying. You\u2019re probably doing this already but improving it will make your system better.\n\nHighlight important information you get but not over-highlighting that it leaves no room for the most important information to stand out. Writing marginalized section on the material also helps. Write notes on the side of your material related to anything that you are learning.\n\nOne of the most effective ways is taking notes and giving your own spin on it. Rephrase the material on your own without losing the main essence of what you\u2019ve studied. Honestly, this is the best thing that works for me. Immediately after reading a chapter, I extract all the main points that stood out to me and write them on my own. I write in a separate notebook then I try to remember other things I can relate to it.\n\nThat\u2019s been serving me well since high school. When I go home, I would revisit the things discussed and explain on my own. During exams, my classmates would ask me why am I not doing last minute review. I don\u2019t pressure my brain through procrastination. I find that it\u2019s more helpful for me to study in advance and share what I know.\n\nMy friends discovered my system and it became a routine for us to set up review sessions several days before a major exam. We reserve a room in a library where we discuss the materials, write things on board and act like teachers. All benefit from each other because each of us has strengths in different subjects. At the end of the exam, most of us say \u201cI\u2019m glad we covered this. There\u2019s no way I would remember this if we did not go over it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s helpful if you can find someone to study the material with you. When you get to share information, you\u2019ll likely to remember them. The more you teach something, the better learner you become. The more involved you are, the better the learning will be.\n\nIn the words of Benjamin Franklin:\n\nIdentify a time of the day for your study time. Most people don\u2019t allot time for it and do last minute cramming. The number one enemy of the brain\u2019s productivity is procrastination. Your neurons get messed up because of different physiological reactions that trigger it.\n\nCal Newport suggests that you engage in \u201cdeep work\u201d when you truly want to learn something. Undivided focus is your number one ally in studying.\n\nAssign a study time, stick to it and when you\u2019re in the zone, be actually there. Minimize clutter around you and remove any distraction that will keep you from focusing. Continual switching saps your attention from your concentrated engagement. It hurts your process which in turn hurts your progress.\n\nThe ventral striatum of the brain processes the sense of reward.Your prefrontal cortex works well when it is highly engaged with the ventral striatum.\n\nNeuroscientist Richard Davidson suggests training your brain to expect a reward from yourself so that you will be motivated to learn. When you decide to reward yourself, make sure to really do it. If not, your brain will be conditioned that you are simply tricking it, therefore, decreasing your motivation to learn.\n\nThe key here is to identify the vital behavior you want to reward and make sure that they match. Misuse of reward can also hurt your process. For example, you tell yourself, \u201cOnce I remember this page, I will get some cookies after each session.\u201d In your desire to get a cookie, you cram information without using efficient brain strategy. In that case, the reward becomes a distractor.\n\nWhen creating a reward, look at how you can match it with the behavior you want to target. Don\u2019t let the reward become a source of distraction. Instead, it should inspire you to make your process efficient and the process will take care of the results.\n\nWhen you are studying, you want to develop a laser-like focus because it helps you learn more. But it is also helpful to give yourself reward like a needed break.\n\nCal Newport suggests taking breaks from focus after some periods of undivided focus. He said, \u201cIf you spend just one day a week resisting distraction, you\u2019re unlikely to diminish your brains craving for this stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving into it. You should instead schedule an occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.\u201d\n\nBrain regions require more glucose when it is acquiring a new skill. Your brain uses a lot of glucose when it\u2019s learning something new. Glucose is the main source of energy for every cell.\n\nWithout enough glucose, the chemical messengers in your brain are not produced. This leads to failure of communication between the neurons. Too much of it is not good either. You cannot drown in soda or donuts to force your neurons to work. In fact, high glucose levels can slowly kill nerve cells.\n\nMichael Green of Aston University in England suggests having more frequent but smaller meals. He said that:\n\nTo have a constant supply of glucose, eat healthy sugar like those obtained from fruits, vegetables, and grains.\n\nExposure to large volumes of information freezes your brainpower. The brain adheres to the principles of recency and exercise. You easily remember the most recent information and those you often repeat. To fully utilize this, you don\u2019t need to wait for last minute studying to remember information.\n\nBrain trainer Roger Seip suggests the use of chunking where you divide information into bite-sized pieces. This would be more effective when you create a study time where you chunk materials on different days. Instead of waiting before the exam to study, learn the material in chunks every day.\n\nWhen you overwhelm your brain with so much information in a day, the brain gets bogged down. Cognitive scientist Sandra Chapman compared the brain to a bank. In her words:\n\nIf you want to increase your cognitive reserves, perform consistent deposits every day. These deposits will eventually compound over time. As you begin to systematically encode them in your brain, the same brain regions show less activation because it does not have to work so hard to carry out the same heavy mental load.\n\nJust like any other task, it would be extremely challenging in the beginning.\n\nOnce you develop a system that works for you, it\u2019ll be easier to study and retain valuable information. It\u2019s literally like you have an assembly line performing in your brain.\n\nEach information has its own file ready to be handed to you when you need it.\n\nWhen your system becomes smooth and efficiently running, you\u2019ll see an increased quality in every output you produce. You don\u2019t get bogged down by overwhelming information. You use your knowledge to advance innovation across domains.\n\nI\u2019ve created a checklist to help you find out if you are operating based on your inner drives. If you are driven inside, your performance and life become better.\n\nHere\u2019s the cheat sheet for you!"

        "text": "There are many types of mountains around us. \n\nOne of them is the mountain of money.\n\nMoney is our world\u2019s engine. Its importance in our lives has changed our behavior. While we all recite that \u201cmoney isn\u2019t the most important thing\u201d phrase, we don\u2019t act like it. Somewhere deep inside, we are wired to long for it endlessly. We either envy or find inspiration in those \u201cmillionaires under 30\u201d (well, now it\u2019s billionaires. A million is nothing, come on!)\n\nWe have this notion that more money = better. But better in what way?\n\nWe all say we want to be happy. We all say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. \n\nYet we all spend most of our time thinking, making or longing for money.\n\nI remember when I first approached this mountain called money \u2014 it looked nice and shiny. It seemed scary, but I couldn\u2019t stop fantasizing about that glorious mountaintop. I couldn\u2019t wait to get there and enjoy the marvelous views I\u2019ve heard so much about. I\u2019ve been told of people who completed that journey. The climax is supposed to be amazing. It\u2019s where everything becomes easier. It encouraged me to get going.\n\nBut like any other mountain I climbed, I lost sight of the summit as soon as I started going uphill. So I kept an image of it in my mind to motivate me. \n\nI couldn\u2019t tell how far I\u2019ve climbed but I kept going.\n\nAnd at some point, I feared I will never get there. I thought: \u201cperhaps not everyone can reach the mountaintop.\u201d\n\nI felt tired. I lost my motivation. It seemed like the summit was getting further and further away from me. As if it grew taller.\n\nI read another guidebook. I tried a shortcut. I took a detour. Nothing worked. But I kept going uphill. I wasn\u2019t going to give up. Not after I\u2019ve come so far.\n\nAnd as I climbed, in small and tired steps, I gradually forgot why I was even doing it in the first place. It seemed like everyone were climbing that mountain too, so I stopped doubting myself. \n\n\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m not going back down,\u201d I said to myself.\n\nI noticed someone a couple of steps behind me. There\u2019s no way I would let him pass. I also saw some people ahead of me. I wanted to catch up. I had to increase my pace. \n\nBut no matter what my speed was, it felt like a never-ending route. \n\nThe road was steep. I became frustrated. I felt miserable. \n\nAs I was wondering whether I\u2019m walking in circles something amazing had happened. I finally reached the mountaintop! I took a deep breath. \n\n\u201cWhat a beautiful view,\u201d I thought to myself. Those around me did not seem pleased. It was then when I realized I wasn\u2019t actually at the summit. Apparently, I still had a long way to go."

        "title": "Experiential Marketing Today: The Evolution of Event Marketing",
        "text": "Though experiential marketing hasn't always been in the same form as today, and the evolution of event marketing dates back to times when the tactics used were so simple that they might not even be considered \u201cexperiential\u201d today, in recent years, technologies have opened doors for marketers to bring a brand\u2019s presence far beyond just a banner ad.\n\nFor instance, consumer packaged goods companies used to rely heavily on free sampling in the past, when their tactic was to allow consumers feel the benefits of their products and hopefully incite a prospect in-store purchase.\n\nWhat was a successful story around fifteen years ago seems to fade away nowadays when technology is the centerpiece in most experiential marketing strategies, especially with the growth of Facebook and Twitter where every viral video involves high-tech activations like pop up shops, or interactive displays. No longer is marketing about just handing out a product, it is about giving consumers a memorable lifestyle experience designed around the product.\n\nIt was Coca Cola who first began to apply the concept of experiential marketing and product sampling back in 1886 when they started distributing sample coupons, transforming Coca-Cola from a small southern city beverage company to a brand available in every state in the US by 1900.\n\nThey would send hundreds of coupons to leading chambers of commerce or churches and ask them to distribute them amongst their leaders. They would then send (very popular at that time) local soda fountains with enough syrup servings for the same number of coupons given before. Between 1886 and 1914 one in 10 Cokes were given away for free.\n\nOne of the first and most memorable mobile marketing tours is Oscar Mayer\u2019s Weinermobile. In fact it has been on tour for almost a hundred years. The Weinermobile was the brainstorm of Oscar\u2019s nephew Karl G. Mayer. This large piece of beef quickly won the hearts and attention of customers nationwide.\n\nToday drivers are still called \u201chotdoggers\u201d as they drive around and hand out mini toy whistles modeled after the Weinermobile called \u201cWienerwhistles\u201d. You can read about some great examples of modern mobile marketing tours in this blog post.\n\nThis iconic and often controversial form of advertising was first introduced in 1984 when Jay Conrad Levinson\u2019s Guerrilla Advertising hit the bookstores. This book laid out the secrets of cost-effective techniques for small-business success featuring some unique, shocking, funny, clever, and creative strategies and campaigns that customers will memorize and won\u2019t stop talking about.\n\nLevinson\u2019s approach has been used for years to help small businesses quell their larger competitors, changing the way advertising game was played by then. Ground breaking advertising firms such as Kirshenbaum and Bond were clear followers of this philosophy as they advertised soft drinks with stickers on fruit and underwear on sidewalk sewer grates.\n\nSocial media completely changed the way brands communicate with consumers, and the way consumers share content with the world. The reach extended from a certain group of people that used to visit an event to a virtual place where people all over the world are watching, and every single experiential marketing agency took note of it.\n\nMany brand activations today include social sharing element like photo contest, or using a #hashtag.\n\nCreating an experience that truly immerses an audience through various interactive elements like simulators, games, live streaming through drones, hologram technology, and virtual reality is what the brands do nowadays during major events like the Super Bowl, SXSW, or Coachella. Immersive events create a memorable and emotionally involving experience that brings long-lasting impression and make the consumers feel more connected to each other and to the brand itself.\n\nNothing can grab attention more than an awesome pop-up event that showcases brand\u2019s products or services in a temporary space for a limited time, building brand awareness and impressing a new audience during a \u201cseemingly unplanned\u201d or temporary happening.\n\nTHANK YOU for listening this story.

        "title": "Why we decided to drop LESS for SCSS \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "What is wrong with LESS? \n\nSince there are already lots of discussions about LESS vs. SCSS, I\u2019m not going to dive deeply into each topic. Instead, I\u2019ll bring up the smaller issues we\u2019ve had with LESS.\n\nSCSS uses the symbol for variable definitions and LESS uses . Since CSS also uses the for media queries and imports and as animation keyframes, this can create confusion for the developer.\n\nOn the other hand, the has no meaning in CSS. The still exists within SCSS but it's used for control directives only, such as , , , and .\n\nWhile this may not be a real world scenario for everyone, having separate identifiers for separate items is always welcome.\n\nSCSS has superior support for more traditional logical statements, such as if/else blocks and loops. Guarded mixins provided by LESS may be easier on the eyes, but they are much harder to master.\n\nSince LESS matches only one of your guarded mixins, you can\u2019t just pass a second argument and handle it within the same mixin without writing everything twice, for every possible scenario. LESS is literally more.\n\nI know this can be shortened by using argument values as property names for this case, but the issue is: I can\u2019t conditionally match two different parts of the same mixin with LESS.\n\nTo achieve the same result with LESS, I had to predefine everything, write a mixin, get the index position, iterate it with my logic until the index value was zero, and call the mixin manually.\n\nThough this is a personal preference, I feel that SCSS handles calculation values and mathematical values better overall.\n\nLESS, on the other hand, is much more difficult. For instance, when I\u2019m using it, I\u2019m not trying to do the math. But even if I was, since when is subtracting 50px from 100% equal to 50%?\n\nWhy do you ignore unit values, LESS?\n\nWhy do you make me learn your quirks on top of my already existing CSS knowledge?\n\nAnd lastly, SCSS has many wrappers for other languages such as C, Go, PHP, Python, Dart and much more thanks to the LibSass project.\n\nWhile we were developing JotForm Cards, our work required us to handle variable values \u2014 pre-compiling and server-side caching at the same time; and it all had to be done without a hiccup.\n\nWe wanted users to be able to customize the look and feel of their forms, with any changes made by the user displayed and cached on the servers instantly and simultaneously. For the sake of our users, we didn\u2019t want to run the client-side LESS wrapper because that would require the processing power of the client \u2014 and loads of things could go wrong.\n\nWe didn\u2019t start our development cycle with the intention of switching from LESS to SCSS. But halfway through the development process, dealing with these minor issues while being unable to find a decent wrapper for LESS was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nThat said, the differences between LESS and SCSS are less important than what they share. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter which preprocessor you use, as long as you use one.\n\nTrying to govern a huge project with a single CSS file and the traditional CSS structure is much more of an obstacle than using a preprocessor that comes with a few minor headaches."

        "title": "The Importance Of UI: Overhyped And Oversaturated? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "This weird question emerged when I had my personal media file damaged and when I desperately tried to find a solution to restore it and have my data back. It\u2019s no easy thing to do for a lame duck such as myself, given that I had to search the web through and ask for an advice at the forums of geek video professionals and figure out whether their advice work for my particular case.\n\nAt the end, I was advised the service that actually worked for me, and I have even been able to restore my video without any additional help, merely following very simple steps on their website (btw, thanks, Video Restoring Services, for saving my day!).\n\nAnyways, those of you who check out the link above, might notice that this service provider has very simple UI \u2014 no glitter, no ads, no distractions, no make-up whatsoever. And at the same time they performed stellar service of recovering my corrupted video file \u2014 they actually provided something that no one else could, and made it very close to the point, without bawling at me with sparkling marketing materials, eye-catching content and all that is assumed to be critical for any online service.\n\nHaving read the feedbacks of their customers, I found out that I was not the only one who was surprised by this lack of marketing efforts: most of their customers noted this fact as well and, unexpectedly, praised their easy-to-navigate-through design, where nothing distracts a visitor from the actual service.\n\nThat simple UI hasn\u2019t spoiled my experience as a customer either \u2014 quite on the contrary, I have been relieved that the steps to restore my video were so easy.\n\nSo I gave all this a thought.\n\nMaybe these guys are right and it is worth focusing on the actual service rather than on the marketing hassle?\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong: I have always been an ambassador of well-polished webpages with lots of visual information stored in the trendiest way to catch the visitor\u2019s attention. Smart blogs, beautiful how-to videos, appealing images and pleasant-looking fonts \u2014 all that makes me happy when I visit a website. This is actually the way I\u2019ve created my own website (no link, sorry, top secret).\n\nBut let us be frank \u2014 what is the real reason of putting all the glitter on our front pages? To attract visitors and make them think we are better than our competitors! And that we are worth trying our services.\n\nSo why is that we have to persuade our potential customers to do so? Is it because we are in the \u201cred ocean\u201d area and fight furiously for every customer impression? Well, that\u2019s a bad sign, then, because when we enter smooths waters of a blue ocean, our conversions increase without any excessive efforts on UI improvements.\n\nAnd mind you, maintaining a good website with trendy UI and appealing content is no easy thing to do. And it definitely isn\u2019t cheap. You\u2019ve got to maintain an army of website developers, designers, content creators, marketing managers to supervise all this madness. Of course, sometimes it\u2019s only UI designer, front-end developer and marketing content manager, but it still comes a little pricey. I know what you think \u2014 it\u2019s still worth the effort, eh? It pays back in a long-term run.\n\nAnd it surely does \u2014 under the condition that you have some great, high-quality solution for your customers and not just throw on a glittery camouflage over some lame service.\n\nThe thing is, this UI thing is so overhyped, everyone is so willing to impress their visitors with visual effects that sometimes they forget about the actual service they promote. Websites are overloaded with content (yeah, good for SEO, I know), both text and visual information, they are beautiful, impressive\u2026 and sometimes play the role of a folding-screen for a very mediocre service.\n\nAnyways, let us be objective:\n\nSo can you keep a balance between being too pushy and too moderate?\n\nShould you stun your visitors with the first impression, or should you lead them straight to the actual service you provide \u2014 without any preamble?\n\nBalance is the key. Try not to bomb your customers with inbound marketing things, but keep your website UI clean and simple, easy to use for the visitors at the same time.\n\nBtw, I have definitely not been the only one who gave this UI thing a thought. Here are the articles from Sophie Paxton , \u201cYour UI isn\u2019t a Disney Movie\u201d and Tony Aub\u00e9 \u201cNo UI is the new UI\u201d who get a new angle on the topic.\n\nRolling back to the topic \u2014 clean UI wins the game. So make sure your customers:\n\n2. Are always welcome\n\n3. Can make their way to the actual purchase flawlessly\n\nWhichever way you choose \u2014 focus on the UI, focus on the service or split attention between the two \u2014 make sure it corresponds with your vision and the ocean you\u2019re swimming in.\n\nAnd to give a hand to those of you who choose to continue with their UI efforts, here is some awesome read by Erik D. Kennedy:\n\nChoose what is best for your business \u2014 and keep the balance.\n\nLiked what you\u2019ve read? Subscribe for more stories!"

        "text": "A little trepidation hangs over me, I admit. It could be a bit of impatience to find our sweet-spot, as we explore our rhythm as a growing, and therefore largely new, team. I suspect though, that a larger part is the reality of the momentous change we have been through at Remote this year, and all the challenges and opportunities this has brought us.\n\nI want so much for Remote, our team and customers, and I can sense the incredible potential of the path we\u2019re on. I have no doubt it\u2019s the right path; I\u2019m humbled by how far we\u2019ve come, and I can almost taste the awesomeness of where we\u2019re going\u2026 but it\u2019s a bit scary!\n\nThe reality of growing a business involves living at the edge of your comfort zone, being open to learning from the team and, an art form in itself, lots of listening, questions and discussion.\n\nAn incredible thirst for growth and focus to deliver truly impeccable work runs through the whole team and connects us all. Everything is therefore being re-imagined. Our management style, the way we organise our days, the vision for the company and each member of the team\u2019s personal vision, as well the way we develop our software and manage our projects.\n\nAs we began to approach the business anew, a year ago now, we took great pains to invest in a truthful, collaborative and people-centric culture. This was demanding for everyone, as it required us to be vulnerable, and bring conscious awareness to how we interact. This was unfamiliar and, at times, a little intimidating, bringing inevitable emotional complications and unpredictable results, and it was exciting and heartwarming at other times.\n\nNow that it\u2019s been a year, however, the somewhat wobbly start has given birth to something deeply precious: Trust.\n\nA culture of autonomy, professional pride and purpose brings days full of learning and support as we walk along an unmarked path together.\n\nAfter nearly nineteen years of business, Remote excites me more today than it ever has. Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t feel like we are just beginning and yet have grown so much, and that blows me away. I am truly inspired by the potential we have as a team and feel honoured to be part of something that helps each and every person achieve their full potential.\n\nI find myself as excited about my involvement in this next leg of Remote\u2019s journey as I was when I started the business with Paul all those years ago. And if each of us achieves three-quarters of our potential, we will fly \u2014 and we hope that, as we share our tools and experiences, others will join us."

        "title": "Diary of an ex-banker: filter bubbles and why they matter",
        "text": "It was back in 2016, with the election of Trump and the Brexit Referendum result that I first became interested in filter bubbles, how they affected our lives and how we could pierce them. This is what put me on the path to set up Just Six Questions.\n\nBack then, I was living in central London and working for an investment bank. I vividly remember the morning after the Brexit vote, going into the office and seeing my colleagues walking around blurry eyed and in disbelief. There were few other topics of conversation in the City\u2019s many wine bars!\n\nSo what exactly is a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d.\n\n\u201c\u2026a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behaviour and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.\u201d\n\nThe term \u2018filter bubble\u2019 first came to our attention around 2011 with the publication of the book \u201cThe Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You\u201d by Eli Pariser.\n\nPariser gives the example of two friends he asked to carry out identical searches for \u201cBP\u201d using Google in Spring 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig was still spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBoth friends were similar in that they were \u201ceducated white left-leaning women living in the Northeast [of the US]\u201d. Yet one friend was shown investment news for British Petroleum as her search results with no mention of the oil spill. Conversely, the other friend was presented with news and the first page of results had links to oil spill stories. One friend had 180 million search results whilst the other had only 139 million.\n\nSo, Pariser tells us, Google is filtering or personalising results to reflect the interests of each person. He believes that this creates a bubble where users get significantly less contact with contradicting viewpoints, causing the user to become intellectually isolated.\n\nOf course, filtering and personalisation are no secret. As far back as 2009 Google announced it would give personalised search results for everyone based on 57 signals, such as location and search history.\n\nThere is some debate about the extent and impact of filtering, but even a Facebook-funded study in 2015 concluded:\n\n\u201cPeople encountered roughly 15% less cross-cutting content [content that cuts across ideological lines] in news feeds due to algorithmic ranking\u2026\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve always chosen which newspapers to read or who to hang out with.\n\nI\u2019m happy to admit that I grew up in a family where we had the Daily Express delivered every day. Why? Because this reflected my father\u2019s view of the world. Now, clearly, the Daily Express selects 1) the stories that it publishes and 2) how it reports those stories. By choosing to read a particular newspaper you are choosing which shade of tinted spectacles you wish to see the world through.\n\nRandomly I just googled \u201cDogs Daily Express\u201d and the first story was:\n\nThe article starts: \u201cThe man in his 20s \u2014 only known as Nikolay \u2014 told officers it was normal in his home country of Kazakhstan to catch and eat the dogs.\u201d\n\nI can already see my father at the breakfast table shaking his head and expressing a mixture of amusement and disgust.\n\nOf course, reading a particular newspaper was only one way in which my father created his own bubble. He was a keen sportsman and an active member of a local cricket club. He joined primarily to use their squash courts and, in later life, to play bowls.\n\nHe would visit the club several times a week and after a game of squash spend an hour or two in the bar chatting with other members and sharing jokes and stories. Now, whilst he would meet a variety of people, this was yet another bubble and one that had clearly been filtered.\n\nWho were the other members? How had they been filtered?\n\n- First filter: Firstly, this was a local sports club so the members were largely drawn from the local area. As the club was located in Surrey my father was unlikely to hear the views of anyone from the Midlands or the North of England, let alone from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.\n\n- Second filter: Membership of a sports club would mainly attract people who played sports and were interested in sports.\n\n- Third filter: There was an annual membership fee so you would need a certain income level to be a member.\n\n- Fourth filter: Perhaps the greatest filter was the fact that to join you had to be nominated by two existing members and approved by a membership committee.\n\nIt should be no surprise that the membership was largely white, middle-class males.\n\nThe newspaper you read and the club you join are just two examples of filter bubbles that predate the internet. So, if filter bubbles are nothing new, should we be worried?\n\nEven if you take the view that the filter bubbles created by the likes of Facebook and Google are totally benign and are created solely for our benefit to try to personalise and improve our user experience, I think there is some cause for concern.\n\nTake the example of newspapers again.\n\nIf I want to read a newspaper I can go into a shop and choose one. I am aware of the type of content and any political affiliation. I know that The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph or the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail are likely to report on stories differently. It is transparent and it\u2019s my choice. With Facebook and Google, they are making the choice for me and it\u2019s not entirely clear on what basis. Nor do I know what the other options might be.\n\nTake the below examples from a recent missile attack on Syria by the US, UK and France. Even though the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror use the same photo, it\u2019s obvious from the headlines that they have a different take on the story. And the Sunday Times seems to be looking at the story from a very different perspective.\n\nThe good thing is that I can choose which newspaper to buy. A typical shop might stock half a dozen different ones. However, imagine that the newsagent only sells the Daily Express and Daily Mail? That is the equivalent of Facebook only showing certain stories in my news feed or Google only giving certain search results. And whilst I would be aware of a lack of choice when I visited a shop, the same isn\u2019t true with social media or search engines.\n\nI am a creature of habit and the likelihood is that I will choose my regular newspaper. If it was my father it would be the Sunday Express pretty much regardless of the headlines. And this is what Facebook and Google are relying on when they filter and personalise. They are looking at your preferences and choices and extrapolating what you like from your past behaviour. To quote from the same Facebook funded survey:\n\n\u201cThe order in which users see stories in the News Feed depends on many factors, including how often the viewer visits Facebook, how much they interact with certain friends, and how often users have clicked on links to certain websites in News Feed in the past.\u201d\n\nBut the important difference between the physical world and the world as seen through social media is that one day my father might decide he\u2019s had enough of the Daily Express or perhaps it\u2019s just that a particular story on the front page of the Daily Mirror grabs his attention so he switches. This wouldn\u2019t be possible with Facebook or Google if they had filtered out the Daily Mirror. You can\u2019t choose something that is not there or that you\u2019re not aware of.\n\nEven if social media and search engines only filter at the margins, the important thing is that they add another level of filtering.\n\nThey reinforce and amplify our existing preferences and prejudices.\n\nLet\u2019s take the example of my father sitting in the bar of his local cricket club. As we have shown, the people he\u2019ll encounter are heavily filtered.\n\nImagine that social media or search engines were added to the mix. It would be the equivalent of having a doorman at the entrance to the bar. The doorman would stop people coming in whom my father hadn\u2019t seen for a couple of months or whom he\u2019d seen but not been particularly interested in their conversation (hadn\u2019t liked or shared their stories or jokes with other members).\n\nAnd whilst my father would most likely be aware of the existence of the doorman and could ask him to go away, the same is not true with search engines and social media.\n\nWe all live in filter bubbles.\n\nSome we might actively choose whilst others are just a side effect of the way we live our lives eg the area we live in or where we work.\n\nFilter bubbles are nothing new and not something invented by the internet.\n\nHowever, as social media and search engines seek to help us make sense of the world and the vast amount of data we are continually exposed to, they add a further level of filtering.\n\nThe problem is that we may not be aware that the filtering is happening, it is not clear how it works, and we can\u2019t easily control it.\n\nIf the filtering was 100% then it would be obvious. The fact that it is only at the margins, perhaps removing 15% of what we would otherwise see on Facebook, makes it much harder to detect. This is the real danger. You may believe that you are being shown a balanced view of the world but this is not the case. And, of course, it could be much worse with search engines. It\u2019s impossible to know what search results you are not being shown!\n\nEven if we take a wholly positive view, where these global corporations always operate with our best interests at heart, the simple fact is that what we see is being filtered without our consent or control. They are the gatekeepers but they are invisible and largely unaccountable.\n\nIf we see the likes of Google or Facebook as less than benign then it could be far worse. They have the power to filter, restrict and control what we see. Or, to use the \u2018C\u2019 word, to act as censors. Cambridge Analytica has opened our eyes to the potential for all of us to be manipulated through social media.\n\nOf course, it could be argued that we don\u2019t have to use Google or Facebook or similar. But I think that is being naive. For most people in the industrialised world, social media and search engines have become utilities. They are embedded into our daily lives and are just as vital as having our houses connected to mains water and electricity. We could live off grid, but few of us would choose to do so."

I find it works best first thing in the morning or before going to bed every day. Put it in your calendar, set a reminder on your phone and stick to it for 3 weeks. After that, your habit will have manifested and it should feel like brushing your teeth \u2014 you can\u2019t go a day without it.\n\nPick a really nice one, one that makes you WANT to fill it with words. Pick a nice pen too. This will make it feel more like a ritual.\n\nDepending on the time of day you are journaling, your journaling goal and preference, there are different formats that might be helpful. Here are a few examples:\n\nFor example: always use two pages for each day, always have the same questions at the same order every time. Why? This will make it easier for you to discover patterns in your thoughts and behaviours. See point 5.\n\nAnd ultimately, define actions to take based on your findings.\n\nHere are some examples:"

        "text": "He just thinks about himself.\n\nWhy the hell is he asking about the progress after every 30 minutes?\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of working hard when he doesn\u2019t even acknowledge our efforts?\n\nOftentimes, we hear such words from employees for their managers or bosses. If you are wondering that your employer-employee relationship is too strong, think again. In a study, two out of every five (39 percent) respondents said that they left a job primarily because of their manager which strengthens the argument that employees don\u2019t leave companies, they leave managers.\n\nToday, when a lot of companies are emphasizing on employee engagement and employee motivation, one wrong move can lose you a valuable asset. This being said, if you are a leader or a manager or a boss, take a look at your traits and habits that might be a pain for those working with or for you.\n\nYou know the most disrespectful thing one can do to someone is shouting orders with zero respect and kindness. The moment you start acting with apathy and demonstrating lack of respect for your fellow workers, you not just make them feel bad but also gain the reputation of being discourteous and snooty. It\u2019s natural for others to label you as too \u2018self-absorbed\u2019 when you talk bad at someone\u2019s back, ignore their efforts, treats them unfairly, and put results over people.\n\nThings like ignoring their requests which are absolutely doable, belittling their inputs, being too inconsiderate can affect employee morale and your relationship with them.\n\n2. You are interfering way too much\n\nSomeone said it right that over-managing your subordinates can do more harm than not managing them at all. No one likes to be micromanaged yet too many bosses seem to be doing it a lot. So much so that it reaches a point when they start bothering employees after every hour to know the progress of the assigned task.\n\nAlways remember that you\u2019ve hired someone only after seeing something in them. So, as a boss or a manager, guide them wherever required and instill your trust so that they can be fully vested in contributing whatever they are inspired to contribute. So, micromanage the process, not the people.\n\n3. You are not giving them the credit they deserve\n\nAs someone who is leading a team, the best thing you can do to boost employee morale and employee engagement is to credit them for their hard work. And, the worst thing could be not recognizing their efforts at all. If you are someone who likes to point out mistakes, then make sure that you\u2019re the first one to give them a pat on the back for a job that is well-done.\n\nStealing someone\u2019s credit to impress your super-senior will not only drive them mad but you will ruin your reputation in their eyes. As a real leader, you should be helping them to shine not hogging all the limelight.\n\n4. You follow the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 attitude\n\nIt won\u2019t be wrong to say that most of us would have worked with someone who thinks he/she knows it all about anything and everything. However, things change, if that someone is your boss or manager. Before ProofHub, I have worked for many organizations. In one such company, one of my colleague would often crib about his manager who would strongly voice his opinions, dismiss ideas others would share, and often force how things should be done.\n\nIn situations like these, employees would restrict voicing their ideas due to the fear of being seen as confrontational or being misunderstood. This I-know-it-all attitude can lead to irate coworkers and an unhappy work environment.\n\nHumans are hard-wired to notice fairness and unfairness. If a certain team member is scoring all the plum-assignments or is allowed to do certain things for which others would be reprimanded, it\u2019s natural for their spirits to dampen. No one would take it when someone less-competent is chosen over them, which is absolutely right on their part.\n\nAccording to a report by Georgetown University, 92 percent of employees have seen favoritism influencing promotions at workplace. Anyone would be fine if a competent team member is being preferred but employee morale can take a huge dip if the preferred guy isn\u2019t as qualified or skilled as them. And, this would seriously drive anyone mad.\n\nThese are my top-five observations that would often drive me and my colleagues mad when I started out my professional journey. I\u2019m sure there would be many things that bother or irritate you as an employee, I would love to know your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nSandeep Kashyap is the Founder and CEO of ProofHub \u2014 a leading project management and collaboration software. He\u2019s one person always on a lookout for innovative ideas about filling the communication gap between groups, teams, and organizations. You\u2019ll find him saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d instead of \u201cGo!\u201d many times a day. That\u2019s what makes him write about leadership in a way people are inspired to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more."

        "text": "I read a quote recently from the Chairman of the Woolworths board.\n\nProbably the greatest quote from any board member. Ever.\n\nI mean at some point, you\u2019d assume people would stop inviting him to be on a board. At some point, surely you\u2019d have to question why they think he\u2019s such good value in that position. I know I would.\n\nUnfortunately, although the role of a board ought to be to assist, back up, and ensure competency and integrity on the part of company founders and management, it\u2019s too often just not the case. There are 2 ways that boards can be completely off the fucking map.\n\nThe Theranos board, for example, were almost criminally negligent in their failure to check, to manage, to rein in or to verify any of the claims that their own company was making. Uber\u2019s board took so painfully long to take action around a culture that was incredibly poisonous that the company lost almost all credibility.\n\nAnd in the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the silence from key board members is not going to inspire confidence in anyone.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, a loss of confidence in a board member is a loss of confidence in a company.\n\nBut while a lack of involvement and a sense of disinterest in the face of obstacles and challenges can breed that loss of confidence, so too can the opposite \u2013 overmanagement, overinvolvement and an inability to leave the running of a company to the people meant to be running it.\n\nThe board of a startup should be taking seriously their responsibility as the stewards and caretakers of the company.\n\nThey should be reflecting on its values and its strategic goals, and measuring the ability of the chief executives to deliver those goals. A board should be involved and active enough that they are asking questions, but never so active that they are intrusive or become micromanagers.\n\nIn cases where a board has to step in to become too involved, to remove members of staff, there\u2019s almost zero chance that the board itself is not culpable \u2013 at least to some extent. If the board have failed to see or respond to an issue long before it reaches a point where they have to be directly making moves and running the show, that\u2019s a major lapse in their own judgement and ability to govern.\n\nA board should be monitoring, and it should be watching and it should be listening. A board should be in tune with their startup. A board should be interested and involved. It\u2019s a fine line, and in my personal experience, it\u2019s one that many either don\u2019t fully understand or don\u2019t want to understand.\n\nAt the end of the day, a board is of huge benefit to a company. They can provide you with the guidance and the direction you need to make difficult choices and make them well. They can provide you with a sounding board, with connections, with a bird\u2019s eye view, with a lifeline and with the authority to do the hard things. But a board must be responsible enough to not leave everything alone \u2013 and they must be able to demonstrate enough trust they don\u2019t have to always be everywhere!"

        "text": "The Dead Simple Strategy for Getting More Done\n\nIt\u2019s not about the hours you put in, so much as what you get done during those hours. This is especially true in a startup or entrepreneurial environment, but also holds up in the corporate world.\n\nI can say so because I work in both.\n\nWork out what you need to get done that day and don\u2019t leave until you\u2019ve gotten it done. If that means you have to stay at the office until 10:00pm, guess what, you\u2019ll stay until 10:00pm.\n\nIf you\u2019re working from home, you don\u2019t leave the house until it\u2019s done. If you\u2019re at the office, you don\u2019t leave the office until it\u2019s done. If you\u2019re at Starbucks, you don\u2019t leave Starbucks until it\u2019s done.\n\nI get it, it sounds dumb. How does that help you get more done? How does it do anything to increase your productivity?\n\nWell, at first it might not do anything. You may end up staying at the office all night. I\u2019ve been there.\n\nSide note: Office buildings get really creepy at night when you\u2019re all alone. Maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m legitimately scared of the dark, but still.\n\nBut as you stick to this, and force yourself to stick around until your work is done, something starts to shift.\n\nAt least it will if you have other things you need or want to get done. You\u2019ll realize you don\u2019t need to waste time on useless things, you\u2019ll spend less time getting coffee, less time scrolling, less time talking to people, and you\u2019ll focus more on the actual things you need to get done.\n\nAnd when you do that, they get done faster. And you end up getting more done.\n\nYou can make it more fun by making it reward-based, like if you finish blank, blank an blank, you get to buy yourself your favorite drink. Then you\u2019ve got something to look forward to at the end of the day.\n\nBut the main point is being unreasonable with yourself about getting the job done.\n\nThe way to get things done is to force yourself to be accountable for completing what you say you\u2019re going to complete.\n\nBe honest with yourself in setting your tasks, but once you\u2019ve made the decision, don\u2019t go back on it.\n\nLying to yourself, letting yourself down, is the worst thing you can do.\n\nAnd when you stop doing it, you\u2019ll find yourself doing more, achieving more and feeling better about your work and self in general."

        "text": "I was an employee my whole professional career.\n\nI have no stories of selling baseball cards when I young or opening a lemonade stand in our neighborhood. I am a purebred worker from day one. I am good at taking orders from my elders and following them to the dot.\n\nI quit my job last year to pursue a digital nomad life. We migrated to Bali Indonesia and built our roots here. For the first few months, I wanted to make money using the skills I have. Either I was looking for Remote work on Angelist, hitting up influencers on Instagram or messaging local restaurants. Everything was on the table and I was all over the place.\n\nThe first thing I did was sell services as a filmmaker. I have the full filmmaking suite \u2014 writing stories, acting, directing and editing. But I was approaching it as an employee and not as a business.\n\nThe next thing I experimented with is consulting \u2014 helping others write, speak in public, or create a short film for their personal brand. This didn\u2019t go anywhere as well.\n\nAll my ideas are service-oriented and they are not scalable.\n\nI was tired from it and I had to shift my mind from being an employee into an entrepreneur.\n\nI played make pretend \u2014 how would I go about this if I am an entrepreneur? What would he do? What would he think? How is he going to solve my predicament?\n\nThen a thunderous roar came crashing from the sky. And with that bang came an answer \u2014 make a product.\n\nSo there I was, scouring the internet to look for ways how to build something and sell it over the internet.\n\nThe journey into building a product is a different beast. It\u2019s not like services where I didn\u2019t have capital expenditure, all I needed was my knowledge and communication skills.\n\nThe biggest thing that holds me back from becoming a successful entrepreneur is fear.\n\nI know that this is the same for everyone who\u2019s transitioning from employee to entrepreneurship. We are accustomed to security and it freaks us out once we\u2019re out in the open. The curse of having a monthly paycheck is debilitating.\n\nThe fear of putting up money, as an investment, still makes me sweat. We are so used to saving money and seeing our net worth increase. And when the opposite happens, it feels like the world will end.\n\nThomas said to me yesterday when we were catching up. He\u2019s an entrepreneur who inspired me to explore e-commerce. He made money from his online business and is now investing his profits into real estate.\n\nI used to play Role Playing Games when I was young. It was exciting and fun. It didn\u2019t have the kind of pressure of life and death. There\u2019s fear of dying but coming back to life is a hundred percent possible.\n\nWe should think of entrepreneurship as a game. It\u2019s hard but it\u2019s supposed to be fun at the same time.\n\nWe need to spend money to make money. This is the reality. But we don\u2019t need to bet our whole life savings into our first venture. The only comfort we can give ourselves is to budget our resources so that we can play the game a couple more times.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid to expect to get it right the first time. Even Elon Musk failed nine times before he launched a space rocket. What if he gave up the eight-time he failed? SpaceX wouldn\u2019t see the light of day.\n\nHustle into your entrepreneurial dreams and make them a reality. It\u2019s closer than you think \u2014 all you need to do is keep moving forward.\n\nTalk to you soon my friend."

        "text": "With AI, AR and blockchain on the rise, now seems like a perfectly good and reasonable time to invest in one of the mentioned high-tech options and create your very own small business. All you need to do is find people who will work for small wages and overtime, and you can begin calling yourself a \u201cstartup\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s how it goes, right?\n\nJust kidding \u2014 no, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nWith technology constantly evolving, it\u2019s true that having your own business and becoming the next Jeff Bezos or Jack Ma seems more possible than ever before. If this is the case, though, why aren\u2019t we all bursting with new ideas and trying to create a new, let\u2019s say, Amazon? What\u2019s stopping us?\n\nWell, the fact that being an entrepreneur in 2018 is not as easy as you might think.\n\nAccording to Fitsmallbusiness.com, 46% of businesses fail due to incompetence, 30% due to lack of managerial experience, 11% due to lack of experience, and the rest due to fraud, natural disasters and neglect. To sum it all up: almost half of all small businesses failed in 2017.\n\nFurthermore, if I mention that 30% of entrepreneurs work 50\u201359 hours per week, would you still consider it to be an \u201ceasy job\u201d? Working 60 hours a week to make something that has almost 50% chance of failing? It sounds like only an insane person would take such a risk.\n\nSome would say an insane person, while others \u2014 a true entrepreneur.\n\nBecoming an entrepreneur is not a decision you can make overnight and lightly. In fact \u2014 this decision requires a lot of self-questioning, self-doubt and worrying. However, if you make it to the other side after all that torture, and still want to start a small business, it\u2019s probably a sign you are ready to embark on this amazing journey.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur requires commitment, a lot of hard work, patience and belief in yourself. It calls for a strong will and an enormous amount of ambition. A true business owner knows that the market is constantly changing and that having a business requires adapting to those changes as fast as possible.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to talk about about six tips and tricks that will help you learn what being an entrepreneur is like and help you become the founder you always wanted to be.\n\nNever underestimate its power, not even 20 years from now! As an entrepreneur, you have to be everywhere. It goes without saying that you should attend all the meetups, lectures, conferences and any events you feel like you can benefit from.\n\nWhy? Because being an entrepreneur (not just in 2018) means always searching for new sources of knowledge and ways to expand your horizons. Not only that, by participating in the startup/tech community, you get a chance to meet a bunch of people who have the experience you need. Most of them, fortunately, are willing to give you a piece of advice or two on how to manage your team, be a leader and create a healthy company culture.\n\nBe persistent and find your place in the community. Well, nobody said being an entrepreneur in 2018 is easy, right?\n\nNowadays, nobody has the time to spend months building a product and then validating it. On the contrary \u2014 validating your idea should be your top priority. Why? Because you\u2019ll get an answer to the questions you have been asking yourself all that time: Does my product/service have a chance to make it? Is my dream really going to come to life?\n\nOur advice to you is to present the product (or an MVP) to its potential customers as soon as you feel ready. That way, you\u2019ll get the much-needed feedback and, if the validation goes well, you will be able to work on the product and adjust it to your users\u2019 wishes.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is all about being active and proactive.\n\nThis leads us to the next tip.\n\nOnce you feel like the product is completed and market-ready, launch it! Be brave and just go for it.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is about being brave and bold. But, make no mistake: being brave is not synonymous with being a gambler. Bravery requires mental or physical strength which is demonstrated as the willingness to do something in spite of a dangerous, threatening situation. Validating your product/service on a cruel market which sometimes feels like it consists out of angry piranhas? Sounds brave to me!\n\nOn that matter, there is one final advice I can give you. Once you finally decide to launch your product, start marketing it before the launch. Prepare yourself for the launch and be positive about it. Let your marketing plan do the magic.\n\nIf anyone knows what it\u2019s like being an entrepreneur, it\u2019s definitely Neil Patel. In one of his recent posts, Patel mentioned the change in the market \u2014 in 2018, the term disruptive innovation is the most important thing to remember. What does it mean?\n\nWell, although this term has been present since 1995, it has reached its full glory in the past couple of years. It can be described as something innovative, done by a startup. So, what is so special about innovation? Well, this innovative product is capable of making a huge impact on the industry, stepping on even the biggest industry competitors. One of the examples of disruptive innovation, as Neil states, is Airbnb.\n\nIn one of my previous blog post about 5 business lessons, I mentioned how Airbnb almost made a huge mistake that could have cost it its reputation. Thanks to being open and owning up to the mistake, its founder managed to save the business. That is precisely what disruptive innovation is: being able to make an enormous boom in the market (and cast a shadow on industry leaders), and being able to manage that boom. Other examples include Facebook, Zoom, Amazon, etc.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 being an entrepreneur doesn\u2019t mean having a brilliant, Facebook-like business idea which will shake the market to its core. You just have to recognize the trend and be aware of the fact that, at the same moment you are thinking about your idea, another entrepreneur-to-be is probably having a similar idea to yours and is looking for a way to become successful on the market.\n\nTo conclude: be aware of the trends, not afraid of them.\n\nDid you know that employees tend to be 20% more productive when they are are working on a project remotely? Not only that \u2014 they are able to sleep more, which makes them feel more rested and alerted. If you are thinking about having a remote team, now is the time to jump on this bandwagon.\n\nWhy should you give it chance? Well, if the statement about productivity didn\u2019t convince you, maybe thinking about operating costs will. Being an entrepreneur also means keeping an eye on the costs. If you give it a thought, you can save a couple thousands of dollars on an office space and invest it in other company infrastructure. Doesn\u2019t sound that bad, right?\n\nSo, before you rush to rent an office, do the math and read through the following facts:\n\nAccording to Forbes, Artificial Intelligence is now bigger than the Internet was when it first appeared. From self-driving cars and customer-facing service, to data scientists being in high demand, the market is moving towards this advanced technology.\n\nSure, not everyone can have or even want to build a company similar to Tesla Inc, but what they are not aware of is that they are probably following this trend by using collaborative tools on a daily basis.\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2014 AI is all around us. If you are not interested in creating self-driving cars, just keep an eye on this particular trend. You never how it might be able to help your business grow.\n\nOut of all these tips and tricks, I have to highlight the one you should always bear in mind. If you are a new entrepreneur who is working on developing a product, don\u2019t let these trends scare you. Use them to your advantage and prove that anyone can make it in 2018, with a bit of luck and a brave heart.\n\nIt is important to be present. Being an entrepreneur in 2018 doesn\u2019t mean following the most advanced technology and trends at all cost. It means being up-to-date when it comes to the newest market trends and combining old-time business principles.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to listening to your intuition and what the market/new trends have to say.\n\nI wish you good luck on your journey!\n\nThank you for reading the article until the very end. What do you think, is it hard being an entrepreneur in 2018? Are there any entrepreneurial tips and tricks I haven\u2019t mentioned? Share them in the comment section below!"

        "text": "3rd Year, B.Tech, Department of Polymer Science and Technology, Univeristy of Calcutta\n\nMany people have heard a lot about the blockchain in frames of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin; however, it can have a much wider use than a simple payment method, including various industries. So, how does blockchain actually work in the healthcare industry?\n\nWhat is the block chain that everyone is talking about? It is a technology that creates immutable and distributable data records which are shared peer to peer between networked database systems. The technology records digital events in a way that does not allow for the data to be changed or recognized until it reaches the recipient. That is why the most significant advantage of block chain is the idea that data is theoretically secured and protected from data breach threats. With widespread and rapidly increasing use, this technology is of particular interest to financial organizations. According to data from the Silicon Republic, block chain startups raised $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1 million in 2017. The financial sector has already realized the benefits of using blockchain. In total, the banks that use this technology save $8\u201312 billion annually. Will medical organizations be able to benefit from cryptography? Blockchain opportunities for healthcare are plentiful and here, we will cover the future potential of this technology in the industry and consider current usage.\n\nThe blockchain era has already begun. Taking into account the fast progress in the development of new and more efficient healthcare record systems, wearable devices, and medical examination systems implementing artificial intelligence, cryptography will become an important part of the way hospitals work. There are, however, a few improvements still needed in order for seamless blockchain adoption across the entire medical industry. According to Hyperledger\u2019s survey, 42.9% of healthcare organizations suppose that the interoperability of electronic health records will help for faster blockchain implementation; with 28.6% of respondents ready to use this technology in care settings today. So, what are the benefits of blockchain technology in healthcare?\n\nWith an ongoing increase in patient numbers, healthcare providers have to manage more and more health data on a regular basis. As the data volume increases each year, it becomes harder for hospitals and clinics to process and store information.\n\n\u00b7 Data collected from IoT devices (Internet of Things) or monitoring systems; and,\n\nSecure information sharing methods, which allow both healthcare providers and their covered entities to verify the correctness of data, are crucial for ensuring proper medical services. This is where blockchain comes in useful, as one of its main advantages is data integrity. When information is recorded and encrypted, it becomes impossible to change or remove.\n\nOne of the blockchain approaches that allows for the secure recording and sharing of information is anchoring data to the public blockchain. This method involves generating a proof of data integrity. Using this proof, any user can verify the data timestamp without the need to rely on third-parties. This method allows users to:\n\nHIPAA requires the usage of safe methods of communication between those who deal with PHI stored in electronic form. That is why data encryption plays a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and safety. Our team has a deep expertise in developing digital solutions for the healthcare industry. One of our projects is a HIPAA compliant online communication platform called MDChat that allows patients to securely communicate with medical employees and be sure they are protected from any hacker attacks.\n\nBlockchain provides a more secure way to protect data than ordinary encryption. The new technology allows for the implementation of new standards in managing insurance claims, PHI, and medical records. It excludes intermediation in data sharing, when using blockchain. Such consortiums as Hyperledger help increase awareness of the advantages of cryptography and further explain how to use blockchain in healthcare.\n\nAccording to the survey mentioned above, the main reason why medical organizations hesitate to use blockchain is the lack of knowledge around this technology. A quarter of respondents are still at the stage of education and exploration, which is why responsible state organizations should make the corresponding information more widespread among caregivers. Healthcare providers suppose that this technology must pass several milestones before any adoption is possible, including:\n\nWe can spend a lot of time wondering why caregivers hesitate to implement blockchain in their organization, though the answer is far simpler than it may seem: they simply do not know enough about this technology and its advantages.\n\nBesides disintermediation, data integrity and provenance, healthcare providers see transparency (55.2%) as one of the top advantages of using blockchain in their industry. To better understand this aspect, let\u2019s consider how it works in the financial sector.\n\nThis technology provides a decentralized register of ownership by recording every transaction made through the system. It stores all details starting from the formation of a data block, and ending with any digits related to a specific transaction. Every device that is a part of the system stores a copy of this block. Before making a transaction, the system confirms whether a blockchain version coincides with another in the network. Therefore, each blockchain user can identify the owner of a particular data block at any time. Furthermore, the blockchain is not only a secure way to send money, but a fully protected data sharing method that widens its potential use in healthcare.\n\nCaregivers feel quite optimistic about fast blockchain implementation, with 37.9% predicting that it will take only five years to adopt it across medical organizations. For now, these organizations and professionals need examples of blockchain, and how it can be helpful in their field. Here, we will cover examples of blockchain use in the healthcare industry, describing existing issues in the sector and considering possible solutions through the use of this technology.\n\nBlockchain in healthcare examples include the following usage issues:\n\nLet\u2019s consider each of them.\n\nOne of the most serious problems in pharmacology is drug counterfeit. According to the Health Research Funding Organization (HRFO), approximately 10%-30% of drugs in developing countries are fake. US businesses lose up to $200 billion annually because of drug counterfeiting; however, the main reason is not in counterfeiting itself, but, rather, that these drugs provide different effects than their traditional medicinal counterparts. They may not help patients at all, or may even be harmful and dangerous to a person\u2019s health.\n\nAs all transactions in blockchain are times tamped and immutable, it is easy to detect fraudulent drug dealers. There are two blockchain types: private and public. Trustworthy healthcare blockchain companies have to register their products in the private system to ensure authenticity and the high quality of their medicines. Private blockchains are moderated by central entities, and the fact that a specific producer or distributor has access to the so-called drug blockchain is proof of drug authenticity. This is where blockchain transparency comes in useful. Once a drug is produced and moves from the manufacturer to retailer, the operational data is recorded on the blockchain. It makes it extremely easy to verify the whole path of the drug, and determine all chain links at any time.\n\nClinical trials are used to determine the effectiveness of particular medicines which cure specific diseases. These tests can either prove or disprove an offered hypothesis. During clinical trials, researchers obtain and record a great deal of information concerning statistics, test results, quality reports, etc. Each scientist is responsible for specific research, making it difficult to control everyone. Those data can then be easily modified or hidden in order to change the whole outcome of the research performed. Criminals are interested in recording the results that are beneficial for them, even if the data does not coincide with the reality.\n\nThis technology allows users to prove the authenticity of any document registered in the system. It provides proof-of-existence by adding data in the form of the transaction and validating the information by all system nodes. As mentioned above, blockchain records immutable data. This characteristic will allow for the storage of results from clinical trials in a secure way, making it impossible to modify data. Two doctors from Cambridge University conducted a 2016 study to see how blockchain can provide proof-of existence for clinical trials. They found that comparing a unique data code, which is set by the system, with the original makes it possible to verify whether the data of clinical trials has been modified, thanks to the inner SHA256 calculator which generates a unique hash every time a modification is made to the data.\n\nPatient data privacy is strictly regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and requires PHI to be totally secure. There is, however, another problem related to PHI: sometimes, patients need to share their medical records with third parties (e.g. with pharmacies when they need to buy specific medicines). So, how can blockchain help protect data while providing partial access at the same time?\n\nThe Blockchain creates a hash for each PHI block, together with a patient ID. Using an API, covered entities can receive the necessary information without revealing a patient\u2019s identity. In the same way, a patient can decide whom to provide with access and whether this access will be either full or partial. Furthermore, a patient can set specific third parties that would have to give their permission for sharing the PHI, if the patient is not sure in what he or she is doing.\n\nBlockchain has a tremendous potential of use in different industries, including healthcare. This technology has already become widespread in the financial sector, but medical organizations still hesitate to implement it into their IT systems. This does not mean, however, that there are no healthcare companies currently using blockchain. Below, you will find a short list of startups that have made this technology the base of their operational structure.\n\n\u00b7 Gem Health (an initiative that promotes blockchain-based collaboration in healthcare);\n\n\u00b7 Cyph (a platform for building secure digital identities and ensuring protected communication between healthcare providers);\n\nBlockchain is an effective technology that can help prevent data breaches in the healthcare industry. It is a secure and reliable method of recording, storing, and sharing sensitive data. Caregivers will definitely benefit from implementing this technology, while remaining HIPAA compliant with this method of trustworthy digital protection."

Welcome to Dubai!\n\nBlockchain technology can be described as a shared, replicated and secure ledger system that allows participants to see one system of records. It is shared via peer-to-peer technology across the members of a network and provides privacy, security and trust.\n\nBlockchain was originally conceptualised and implemented as a digital currency to solve a flaw in digital cash systems, known as \u201cDouble-spending\u201d.\n\nDouble-spending is a situation in which the same digital token is spent more than once, primarily due to file duplication. A result of this was a loss of trust in the circulation of such currencies.\n\nBlockchain eliminated vulnerabilities by introducing a secure and synchronised shared ledger system. In the case of a banking system, transactions are endorsed by selected members and are kept private. Moreover, transactions are immutable \u2014 meaning that they are not modifiable. This builds trust between the stakeholders \u2014 the end user and banker.\n\nRecently, the National Bank of Dubai, the biggest bank in Emirates, had become the pioneer in implementing blockchain technology in the Middle East.\n\nThe bank had created a blockchain platform known as Cheque Chain to provide higher security standards and prevent fraud. The idea behind the cheque chain is that each cheque issued by the bank has a unique QR code.\n\nUpon validating the cheque in a transaction, the cheque is registered on the bank\u2019s Blockchain platform. This allows for a secure validation of authenticity and real-time access to the source at any given moment, at any given location.\n\nIt can be said that Dubai was one of the forerunners in embracing the technological marvel that is blockchain, primarily owing to their conferences and summits.\n\nIn May 2017, twenty-one start-ups, from around the world, had pitched their ideas in the \u2018Smart Dubai Global Blockchain\u2019 challenge. This helped bring cross-border collaboration to assess and elaborate these ideas into use-cases for full implementation in the near future.\n\nThe Dubai International Blockchain Summit was held on the 8th of January 2018. Twelve countries had participated in this summit and over thirty-five speakers discussed the trends in financial technology among 1000+ attendees. Topics of discussion included \u201cBlockchain and Virtual Reality,\u201d \u201cThe impact of Cryptocurrencies on Global Economy,\u201d \u201cMaking Blockchain Powered Cities,\u201d \u201cHealthcare and Blockchain\u201d and \u201cCombating Fraud using Blockchain Technology\u201d.\n\nThe Dubai Blockchain Summit was held on the 28th and 29th of March 2018 which was organised by the Global Blockchain Foundation, a non-profit organisation. Organisations such as the Wipro, The Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Fintech Association of Hong Kong were collaborators in the summit. Guest speakers included Chris Snook, the Chairman of the World Tokenomic Forum and Waqas Mirza, the CEO of Avanza Innovations. Topics of discussion included \u201cBlockchain Opportunities in Dubai 2020\u201d and \u201cRe-Engineering the Global Socio-Economic Landscape using Blockchain\u201d.\n\nFurther, The Future Blockchain Summit, organised by the Dubai World Trade Center, is to be held on the 2nd and 3rd of May 2018. It is a follow-up to the 2017 event and covers industries such as Fintech and Banking, Food Technology, Logistics, Healthcare, Smart Energy and Transportation, to name a few. There are over a hundred guest speakers and over eighty expert vendors and startups participating in this event. Event partners include Oracle, Microsoft and The National Bank of Dubai.\n\nThe Government of Dubai had signed a MoU with Avanza Solutions to create breakthrough solutions using a blockchain platform known as Cipher. This would then be used for a citywide blockchain based payments platform.\n\nAlso, the Ruler of Dubai along with the Prime Minister of the UAE had launched a strategy to adopt and invest in blockchain technology. known as \u201cThe UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021\u201d, which is built on four fundamental principles \u2014 the happiness of residents and citizens, advanced legislation, government efficiency and global entrepreneurship.\n\nFurthermore, Dubai\u2019s Transport Authority announced plans to create a vehicle management system, based on the blockchain, that allowed customers to track history of their vehicle. This would come into action by 2020."

        "text": "Today, I had a meeting with my two sisters.\n\nThis is probably the 6th we\u2019ve had since restarting our company.\n\nRight now it seems as if everything is moving slow, but I\u2019m learning sometimes I need to be the turtle and not the hare. \ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udc07\n\nThe first few weeks were spent unfollowing everyone on our Instagram account. Doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but we were following a lot of people, upwards of 7,000.\n\nWe agreed to do 200 unfollows each, a day and one day I decided to push the limit and do more. I just wanted to hurry and get our following count down.\n\nUnfortunately, I wound up getting us in Instagram Jail and we were blocked from unfollowing for 3 days.\n\nMy sisters didn\u2019t press me, but I know on the inside they were definitely like,\n\nI got ahead of myself and I had to apologize.\n\nI admit I can definitely get impatient and go at things full throttle when sometimes it\u2019s required to take a step back and slow down.\n\nMany people have heard of follow for a follow and it definitely works.\n\nThe second time I re-upped the business in 2016, this is what we did.\n\nWe were semi-aggressively following the followers of one of our competitors. They sell a different style of headbands and they have a ton of followers (like 180,000). Their followers were already open to our product and would follow our page and immediately buy a headband.\n\nIn addition to that, we gave away free products every week so our engagement was high.\n\nThough nobody said anything, it was quite obvious what we were doing as our followers kept increasing and the number we were following kept going from 5,000 to 0 every couple of weeks.\n\nI know this is a commonly used practice, but I want to try something different this go around.\n\nWe\u2019ll be trying a strategy I learned from Gary Vanyerchuk.\n\nI\u2019ll talk about it more in a few weeks when our new headbands arrive and we start implementing the strategy.\n\nOne member of our team was slacking for a few days and we had to convene for a little motivational pow-wow.\n\nThough my sisters and I have to hold each other to account, everyone has to individually make sure they\u2019re holding up their end.\n\nSometimes that part takes some getting used to.\n\nEspecially when all you\u2019re used to is working a traditional job.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a paycheck at the end of the week, it\u2019s easy to be driven to get the work done.\n\nWhen there\u2019s no paycheck and a lot of work to be done, something else has to be the drive.\n\nFor one sis this drive is a celebratory trip abroad once we reach a certain goal.\n\nFor the other, we\u2019re still working on that driving factor.\n\nFor me, I just want to be able to transition out of the remote job I have and travel the world with my kids.\n\nOkay, so first of all, headbands are just the start.\n\nWe definitely want to get into clothing and other items but we can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves.\n\nAnother reason why I lost passion for the company before was that I was lacking a clear mission. I knew I wanted it to be more than just an exchange of money for a cute product.\n\nI wanted to provide something exciting and motivational.\n\nI was having trouble meshing selling headbands into being an inspirational brand.\n\nWe were throwing all kinds of things at the wall to try to create this sort of brand message, but sometimes it didn\u2019t quite work.\n\nAt one point we were doing musical Mondays and having singers sing while wearing the headbands. The singers were great and those videos got some views, but it didn\u2019t quite fit.\n\nSo one thing on the top of our priority list right now is creating a unifying mission and story for our company.\n\nI haven\u2019t completely figured that part out yet. I have an idea, but it would require me to be more focused on the type of content I create.\n\nLast week I was talking to Brian Tobias, who is a lifestyle vlogger on YouTube. I was discussing how I originally started with no niche because I wanted to stop making excuses and just start.\n\nHe was explaining how, when his content was going from food to entrepreneurship to fitness, it confused his audience a bit and as a result, his views went down.\n\nNow he just focuses on just entrepreneurship and his YouTube channel is doing better.\n\nI totally get what he was saying, a niche is more powerful.\n\nMy podcast will be pretty easy for me to fit into the inspirational niche. But I know how I am with my writing and it\u2019s going to try and rebel against this niche plan.\n\nFor the moment I\u2019m not going to stress it.\n\nThere are a lot of steps but the fun part is building and putting all the pieces of the puzzle together."

        "text": "Medium is great for humanity, because it acts like a Trojan horse in our smartphones. Smartphones are destroying our attention span.\n\nShort clips, streams of blurbs and pictures are replacing books. In this environment, Medium is providing an alternative to all of that digital candy.\n\nMedium posts aren\u2019t a replacement for a book. Most of us write our posts taking into account the short attention span of online readers.\n\nIn either case, Medium posts are much better than most of the digital candy in your pocket. It requires you to stay focused on a piece of content for a few minutes.\n\nMedium is great for readers, because it provides readers with a steady stream of brilliant posts and the opportunity to interact with the writers and other readers.\n\nMedium is great for bloggers, because it provides them with a large audience of readers. Personal blogs have a difficult time building an audience. This has always been the case.\n\nWith the introduction of smartphones and apps, the number of blog readers is shrinking even more. In this age, Medium is like an oasis for bloggers.\n\nOnce you publish a sufficient amount of posts, you have a decent set of stats. You can use those stats to learn your lessons on blogging and to improve your craft.\n\nThe opportunity to interact with the readers is great for the writers. I\u2019ve been blessed with a steady stream of responses to my posts and I\u2019m grateful for that. That feedback is critical for any content provider.\n\nThat discussion is valuable for the readers as well. They are able to influence the writers with their feedback. They can ask questions and receive answers. As a result, everybody wins.\n\nMedium Is My Single Source of Traffic\n\nIt\u2019s a risk for a blogger to depend on a single source of traffic. When I take into account all the benefits above, I\u2019m willing to take that risk. As a blogger, I\u2019m fine with using Medium as the single source of traffic to my website.\n\nIf you read my post called Is Commenting on Medium a Reliable Strategy to Grow the Audience of Your Blog?, you might think that I changed my mind. I didn\u2019t.\n\nCommenting is great to interact with other writers. It\u2019s just not an efficient way to grow your audience. Actually, I might have found why it isn\u2019t.\n\nCommenting might not work, because Medium is suppressing some comments. They are probably trying to minimize spam comments this way and it works. Spam is almost non-existent on Medium.\n\nI understand that Medium is hiding some comments, but there\u2019s room for improvement in how Medium processes comments.\n\nMedium Notifications Are Less Than Optimal\n\nAs a writer, I expect to receive an email for every comment I receive. That is not the case at the moment. I found that out after finding old comments by chance.\n\nI received some decent comments written by new members. I didn\u2019t receive an email about them. I wasn\u2019t able to clap for them or respond to them. As a result, those comments remained hidden.\n\nNew Member Responses Are Not Notified to the Writers\n\nHow would you feel about Medium, if you signed up just to comment a post, took your time to write a decent comment, and then, your comment remained hidden and you didn\u2019t receive a response from the writer?\n\nWould you keep using Medium? I believe this practice hurts the new user acquisition number of Medium.\n\nA Better Way to Display Notifications to Writers\n\nYou might say that it\u2019s my responsibility to check my notifications and find all of those comments. Unfortunately, with the dozens of notifications I receive every day, Medium\u2019s notifications are useless to me.\n\nIn order for them to be useful to me, they have to satisfy the following requirements.\n\nMedium iOS App Has the Best Notification Settings\n\nLuckily, I found a workaround to this problem. In the iOS app, there are three options for push notifications for responses.\n\nThe default is \u201ctailored for you\u201d and I chose \u201ceveryone.\u201d I\u2019ll see how this works out. I\u2019d really like to see the \u201ceveryone\u201d option for email notifications.\n\nI\u2019d like to receive an email for every response receive. That would make the task of processing responses much easier. In the meantime, if I missed a comment of you, I apologize.\n\nMedium benefits bloggers, readers, and humanity in different ways. As a writer, I appreciate it so much that I use it as the exclusive source of my traffic.\n\nThere is one update I\u2019d like to see on Medium though. That is to receive an email for every response that my posts receive.\n\nI also suggest that Medium handles new user comments with care. Otherwise, they might lose some of those users forever.\n\nIf you know a tool that processes Medium notifications and creates to do lists out of them, please let me know in the comments."

I just didn\u2019t know it was a chatbot, or that real people actually MAKE chatbots, or that other people actually LOVED the connections that bots like HEROES can facilitate, until that moment.\n\n(This sounded even more basic in real life than it does here, but I love being basic sometimes).\n\nIt was that Dame-Judy experience all over again where Emanuele\u2019s work had already reached and connected so many- he was mortal, yet the reach of his work was cosmic."

Tell a venture capitalist that you are a social entrepreneur, and you will very likely hear words such as \u201cThere is no such thing as social entrepreneurship.\u201d Another VC says \u201cYou can\u2019t be a for-profit social enterprise \u2014 keep charity separate\u201d, he advises. In general, social entrepreneurs will spend a lot of time explaining how and why they are not running a non-profit organization.\n\nWhen you hear of social entrepreneurship you will hear the term change-maker, but not money-maker. Sustenance for entrepreneurship comes from profits. Even a social entrepreneur needs to make net profits to stay in business.\n\nThe difference between a social entrepreneur and the normal (that\u2019s a deliberately chosen descriptor) entrepreneur, I suspect, is the social entrepreneur\u2019s ability or willingness to recognize early in the entrepreneurial lifecycle, that one can be proactive in the development of goodwill as an asset in one\u2019s community.\n\nThe mindset of a social entrepreneur is fundamentally different from that of the organizer of a non-profit or a charitable organization. The social entrepreneur is an entrepreneur by nature. She wants to be able to move swiftly address market opportunities. She may not want the rigidity of a non-profit organization\u2019s regulations. She may prefer a for-profit status and yet create something people that is good for people, and something for which people will gladly pay a market-price. She may cherish being able to retain creative control of what she is building. She may enjoy business ownership. She may believe that one can do well and do good by delivering economic value to the community.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs may be perfectly fine with self-imposed rules of how they will price their products for reasonable profits and growth, while simultaneously focusing on products that contribute to a society\u2019s betterment. Or they may be willing to charge a high price as a signaling mechanism that they are creating a premium product, while giving away a lite-version for free to still make a difference in the community.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs may not want the rigidity imposed by laws that govern non-profit organizations, but they may be perfectly fine to step up and become more transparent as an organization, as seen with B-Corporations or with some startups that are extremely transparent.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship is a choice that such entrepreneurs exercise \u2014 to allow market forces to determine the value of what they are building. It is a choice they make to embrace the efficiencies that come only when customers speak with their wallets. A non-profit, by separating funding sources from customer delight, inherently dodges the rigors of efficiency, productivity and money-for-value that is forced upon it by an unforgiving market. The concept of money remaining in the budget that \u201cmust be spent\u201d by the financial year-end does not or should not exist in a social entrepreneurship.\n\nHowever, social entrepreneurs, if they do not brand themselves with clarity, can cause themselves expensive detours, avoidable heartaches and needless runarounds because no one will take the time to explain to the social entrepreneur that they simply ignore emails from a social entrepreneur who has not established a not-for-profit organization.\n\nThe reality is that social entrepreneurship is misunderstood. There is a consequent lack of societal support systems that non-profit organizations have come to take for granted over the years.\n\nThe confusion is so pervasive that a major entrepreneurship conference recently recognized a non-profit organization\u2019s Executive Director as the \u2018Social Entrepreneur of the Year\u2019. To add to the irony, the non-profit\u2019s founder had passed away decades ago, even if one were to define a non-profit as an entrepreneur\u2019s creation.\n\nFrom a branding perspective, entrepreneurs should be selective about when and where they refer to themselves as social entrepreneurs.\n\nA social entrepreneur must only be involved in community service under clear organizational banners that can fit into known categories \u2014 such as a for-profit, a non-profit entity or a charitable organization \u2014 because our society does not know in which slot social entrepreneurs fit. They are floating without direction in a no-man\u2019s land.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs must create and own a clear definition of how the world should slot them.\n\nOtherwise, their startup brand\u2019s perception can get lumped with non-profits, or charities \u2014 in which case they lose out. They lose out because they can never compete with non-profits on an economic footing. Civic policies and corporate policies do not yet recognize the social entrepreneurs\u2019 startups as purpose-driven enterprises that cannot collect donations to sustain themselves.\n\nHowever, there is a bigger risk with social entrepreneurship. If the social entrepreneur does not strive for clarity in how her brand gets perceived, her brand risks being perceived as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\nWearing a brander\u2019s hat, my recommendation to social entrepreneurs is to use the \u2018social\u2019 prefix with discretion \u2014 because, on the one hand, it may hurt your venture and on the other it may not help the cause you care about.\n\nThe only place where the \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019 moniker might help is in recruiting mission-driven talent. Save the term \u2018Social Entrepreneurship\u2019 for your job ads.\n\nLet the \u2018social\u2019 flavor of your entrepreneurship be your secret super-power as you keep build your goodwill faster than your competition. You will start seeing results not just in better hires, but in better relationships in the marketplace, better customer retention and better customer evangelism for your brand.\n\nLet your entrepreneurial venture\u2019s actions in the community you serve determine how such community wants to define you \u2014 whether as an employer, or a vendor, or a buyer. So long as you are profitable and are staying in business, you are in good shape to continue to be purpose-driven. So long as you are doing good in society by building something that makes lives better and creates jobs and feeds families, your brand will be thought of fondly. You may even be considered a social entrepreneur \u2014 whether referred to as one or not.\n\nThe author Ramesh Sambasivan is the principal designer and program lead at SiliconGlades, a business innovation and design firm that helps startups with product marketing viewed through a social-impact lens, and helps more established organizations uncover their Sales DNA to achieve growth through giving."

        "text": "Warning: If you\u2019re an accountant save yourself some stress and read something else. Not this story \u2014 you\u2019re not going to like it.\n\n\u201c\u0093I let my accountant do my taxes because it saves time \u0096sometimes as much as 10 years.\u0094\u201d \u2014 Milton Berle\n\nYou know what they say about lawyers (the only thing sadder than four lawyers trapped in a burning car is three lawyers trapped in a burning car) and economists (you can line them up \u0096 every single economist in the world \u0096 head to head, and they still wouldn't\u0092 reach a conclusion).\n\nBut what do you say about accountants?\n\nEspecially when they end up running your business?\n\nIn 1984, 25-year-old Martin Diedrich, who grew up picking coffee on his family\u0092s Guatemalan coffee farm, opened his first coffee store in Irvine, California. By 1991, the company had four stores earning $125,000 on sales of $3 million. Diedrich was working hard for his money, staying up late, living in his parents\u0092 house.\n\nHe found help in the person of investor Paul Heeschen, who gave Diedrich $1million and recruited a tax accountant to run the company. Heeschen and his number-crunching hires opened up new locations but failed to make them work. In 1996, they took the company public and raised $12.6 million. Losses piled up, however, and the stock price tumbled.\n\nJust before the whole thing collapsed, the company\u2019\u0092s board made a \u0093last-ditch\u0094 change by doing something that should have been done in the first place. They got rid of the CPAs and hired a couple of managers who knew nothing about money but everything about what the business was about: selling food on a franchise basis.\n\nBoth had serious prior experience, including senior positions at Taco Bell Worldwide. The Taco Bell duo embarked on an ambitious project of fixing and expanding the business by selling inexpensive franchises ($30,000 each) to experienced entrepreneurs who were able to buy them in groups.\n\nThe result? Six mega-franchises totaling 472 stores have already been started, and thousands are planned.\n\nI have seen it from afar and have experienced it firsthand. My first big opportunity in direct marketing came as the result of the firing of a bureaucrat.\n\nSome years ago, I was involved in the acquisition of a European business that had been grown by an entrepreneur who sold it to a financing group that hired a team of accountants to run it. At the time of the sale, it was worth about $10 million. By the time the professionals got through with it, it was seriously unprofitable.\n\nThat allowed us to cut a very good deal for ourselves. We got half the business for agreeing to fix it. Our first decision was to get rid of the number-crunchers who were running it. To take their place, we promoted a young marketer, hungry and smart, with a strong interest in proving his worth.\n\nToday, this is one of our best-run businesses and our most profitable overseas operation. I could give you other examples. And maybe I will some other time.\n\nAt some point in the growth of your business (usually when you have between 25 and 100 employees), everything will be \u0093beyond you.\u0094\n\nYou will feel the need to bring in a strong administrator, someone who understands the science of business, who can organize and coordinate everything, and can rescue you from the stuff you hate to do (and don\u2019\u0092t do well).\n\nMy advice is this: Resist the urge. If you want someone to take over as CEO, select a marketer. A business that strives toward growth and profits is always superior to one that aims at order and rationality.\n\nThere is something in the heart of an accountant (or any administrator, for that matter) that is bad for business. It is a sort of arrogance. And it has an evil twin in the accountant\u0092s mind: the idea that you can grow a business by the numbers.\n\nBusinesses can be driven by marketing and led by product development. But systems and policies can NOT keep them alive\u0096 for very long.\n\nYes, there are some good accountants running businesses. I have the pleasure of working with one right now. His great strength, however, is that he recognizes his limitations. He focuses on keeping costs down and making the business work harmoniously.\n\nBut he doesn't\u0092 pretend that is enough. He is also learning the selling and product side of the business. It\u2019\u0092s not natural for him, but he\u0092s a bright guy and (I\u0092\u2019m happy to report) the business is doing OK.\n\nEventually, he will be a fully rounded CEO. And when he gets there, I hope he\u2019\u0092ll have the wisdom to be careful about how much authority he gives his number-crunchers."

        "title": "The \u2018Art\u2019 Behind Communication \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Communication is vital to information exchange, but are we utilizing it properly and understanding it\u2019s intended use?\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Communication as \u201c a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behavior\u201d. Communication is crucial in any environment. Without proper communication (verbal or non-verbal), we fail to express our thoughts. The art of communication allows us to build connections and initiate conversations that provide clarity and purpose. All we are doing is taking our ideas or thoughts and using different techniques to convey those to someone else. We follow communication by listening to understand and respond to messages others are conveying to us. But if we dig deeper, communication is one of the most complicated skills to master. There are many obstacles, unclarities and misunderstandings that often result as part of an ineffective conversation.\n\nOne of the most common places where communication can be challenging are workplaces. Misunderstanding and ineffective communication seems to be the culprit in most situations. The challenge of actively trying communicating the intent of one\u2019s message and having the recipient get a full and accurate understanding of the message is a tough one. For teams, that can also hinder growth. In his article 8 Powerfully Potent Communication Techniques Kyle Seagraves outlines 6 powerful outcomes effective communication results in \u2014 which I believe are crucial to a team\u2019s success. He mentions: When You Communicate Clearly, You Create: \u201cThe single best problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place\u201d Miscommunication can be linked to various factors, but how can we make sure that our intent is being communicated across?\n\nFirst step to communication is being vocal. Have the courage to speak your mind \u2014 but respectfully and in a tasteful manner. Don\u2019t assume that your listener already knows what you are thinking. Say No when you mean No, disagree when you don\u2019t agree, suggest when you have ideas.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard the statement before, majority of your talking is done through body language. Engage your party in your conversations. Simple tricks of leaning in, making eye contact, a genuine smile can all contribute to a positive conversation. Pay attention to visual cues to further the conversation.\n\nBuilding conversations garners a deeper relationship between the conversationalists and builds a common understanding. Conversations allow us to connect and be open with each other. It not only enhances our non-verbal communication but makes us feel comfortable enough to share our personal and deeper thoughts. Over time with trust, it also fosters compassion.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard it all before, listening is different than understanding. You can listen to a communication and not relate, not intake, not understand. Being a good conversationalist also requires the ability to listen and understand what the sender is communicating to you. Good understanding of the intended message, allows the receiver to process the information to respond appropriately. It shows genuine interest and helps us empathize with the sender. What communication skills do you user to effectively relay your message?"

        "title": "Hacking Lead Gen with Facebook Lead Form Ads [How To]",
        "text": "Facebook has some of the most advanced retargeting options all around and it\u2019s true with Lead Ads as well. Be sure to create at least one ad set that retargets users who opened your lead form, but didn\u2019t submit.\n\nWe recommend retargeting ads to use a different offer and different selling point. Either they just didn\u2019t get around to submitting or there\u2019s some reason they didn\u2019t convert from the first interaction. Take a different angle, add another constraint (ie. time is running out), or sweeten the deal (they\u2019ve already indicated some interest opening your form\u2026 capitalize on this warm audience!).\n\nAlso, make sure to exclude users who have already converted from any other audiences in use.\n\nRemember, the longer it takes you to make contact with the prospect, the more their memory fades.\n\nFacebook integrates with a number CRMs out of the box. If your CRM is on that list \u2014 great, connect the systems and make sure new leads receive an immediate follow-up.\n\nIf you\u2019re not on that list or don\u2019t use a CRM\u2026 don\u2019t worry. My favorite option is actually Zapier. There\u2019s so much you can do with it. Zapier can transfer data to nearly any system, it can backup your leads to a spreadsheet, and you can send messages right from there.\n\nCollecting phone numbers instead of email addresses? Use an automatic text messaging service. Text messages are opened 98% of the time!\n\nYou\u2019re collecting leads\u2026 but some percentage of people will be hot and ready buyers. Maybe they\u2019re in need of your solution NOW.\n\nMake it easy for them to escalate themselves. List a phone number and email address on the Thank You page.\n\nThis is game changer that most advertisers pass right over. Just like providing them an option to contact you\u2026 why would you ever put a brick wall at the end of the customer journey?\n\nInstead, tell them what they need to do next. Provide a second call-to-action, such as:\n\nThey\u2019re already a hot prospect, interested in your offer and you\u2019re top of mind. Let them upsell and cross-sell themselves. There\u2019s always some percentage of people who will want more.\n\nSee the screenshot above for an example.\n\nCurrently the only \u201cWhen You Get Charged\u201d option is Impression for Lead Ads. That means your charged every time Facebook shows your ad to someone. Every time, no matter if they click, convert, or scroll right on past to the next dog meme.\n\nThat\u2019s different than CPC (cost-per-click), where you only get charged when someone engages. CPC is great because you can call out your target audience or disqualify other audiences right in your ad copy. \u201cMarathon runners can decrease soreness with\u2026\u201d (Your average treadmill user is less likely to click) or \u201cHomeowners with lawn care issues can try\u2026\u201d (Condo owners or renters are less likely to click).\n\nWatch your conversion demographics like a hawk. If you notice that older users account for more of your conversions? Then limit the age range of your targeting. Notice that you receive very few leads on the weekends (commonly for B2B campaigns, when people are not in that mindset on the weekends)? Then limit your campaign to only run during workdays. Optimize towards the sweet spot and you\u2019ll eliminate wasted impressions and wasted ad dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s better to be more specific in targeting of your lead ads. If you see that your ads are not showing, then expand, but keep in mind you\u2019ll be charged each time your ad is shown.\n\nCheck out this example above from the first day of a campaign. On day one we immediately see that woman 25\u201334 are the best converting age group. If this trend continues, hone your targeting and messaging to this specific demographic. Update your targeting to be women 25\u201334. Update your images to use young women, speak directly to them and use wording they understand and resonate with.\n\nWhat cost per lead should you expect? That will depend highly on the targeted audience and ads themselves. Your Lead Ads may start at $10\u201320/lead or more\u2026 and over time optimizing all the way down to less than $1 per lead is not uncommon.\n\nOnce you have their email address, they\u2019ve indicated interest. Keep that lead warm with display ads on other platforms, such as the Google Display Network, LinkedIn, or Twitter.\n\nThese are great opportunities for lead nurturing while your salesperson hurries to make contact. Did the lead sign-up over the weekend? Many times they\u2019d forget by Monday, but if you retarget maybe they\u2019ll have seen your logo a handful more times and by the time Monday rolls around you\u2019ll still be top of mind.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve covered a lot here from information about Lead Ads to tips and best practices for optimizing your campaigns. Lead Ads are still new and a great opportunity to get ahead of your competition. Go give them a try and let me know if you have any questions!"

        "text": "In sales, there\u2019s a lot of terrible advice provided by gurus and coaches who\u2019ve sold very little in their careers but make their living teaching other people how to sell.\n\nThis post was written to help dispel four all-too-common myths about sales success.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve hired and fired dozens of sales reps.\n\nIn studying the personalities and habits of the most successful reps that I\u2019ve hired, I\u2019ve found the vast majority to be introverts \u2014 not extroverts.\n\nBut wait \u2026 how can this be?\n\nHow can a mildly shy introvert outsell an outgoing energetic extrovert?\n\nNow, of course, being successful in the profession of sales as an introvert doesn\u2019t mean you can hide in your shell and avoid speaking with people.\n\nAll high-achieving sales professionals that I know universally share one trait:\n\nIf the applicant isn\u2019t actively reading any educational/self-improvement books (preferably by sales authors), the interview is shortly terminated.\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2026 everyone is busy with something.\n\nFor the unsuccessful, this \u201csomething\u201d usually consists of bullsh*t activities that don\u2019t actually move the needle.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re a real estate agent, your key activities are likely to consist of cold calling homeowners (prospects) and knocking on doors (securing listings).\n\nAll other tasks outside of your \u201ckey activities\u201d list should simply be delegated.\n\nOne unfortunate misconception about sales is that it\u2019s a profession with lots of \u201cpeaks and valleys\u201d.\n\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve found the most effective solution to avoid having your sales pipeline dry up is to have a daily routine built on consistent outreaching.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb \u2014 regardless of your industry \u2014 80% of your sales should come from warm referrals (new customers referred to you by your existing customer base).\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been introduced and recommended by a friend of your prospect, you\u2019ll experience far less friction when trying to build rapport and will be able to close with less effort."

They\u2019re always looking at new technologies and ways of working that will deliver better work for our clients.\n\nThese last few weeks, the words \u2018Progressive Web Apps\u2019 (PWAs) have left their lips many times, so I decided to take some time to look into the brave new world of PWAs properly, so that I could get a real feel for the potential this approach to web development could unlock for our clients.\n\nSo, I started at the beginning\u2026 What are Progressive Web Apps?\n\nIt turns out that Progressive Web Apps are essentially websites that utilise a collection of technologies, design concepts, and Web APIs in tandem to provide an app-like experience on the web. This is really neat, because it combines the reach of the web with the speed, user experience and functionality that apps have to offer.\n\nPWAs are visited in a web browser the very first time the user visits the site, just like a regular website, so there\u2019s no requirement to visit an app store and no download and install. And, as the user engages progressively with the PWA over time, they provide enhanced functionality like being accessed via an icon on the home screen of a device, just like an app.\n\nPWAs load quickly, delivering enhanced performance. They also boast an app-like user experience; loading as a full-screen experience with smooth, app-like transitions, even on a slow internet connection. Combined, this is proven to drive up user engagement and conversion rates.\n\nThey have other native app functions as well, such as the ability to send push notifications to the user\u2019s device and the ability to work offline.\n\nPWAs are the next step in web development. In the coming months, we will be releasing our first few Progressive Web App developments. I\u2019m excited by this prospect. It will bring parity to the user experience of the web and native apps that we develop, enabling our clients looking for a web solution to harness the functionality they might expect of an app and reach more users beyond the confines of the app store.\n\nBy applying all that Progressive Web Apps have to offer, and taking inspiration from native apps, we can build truly amazing experiences on the web. And if this tells me anything, it\u2019s that 2018 is likely to bring some very exciting developments in progressive web applications at Remote."

        "text": "How to Reach the New Business Niche: Connected Car App Development Approaches\n\nFor the most of us, our cars are a part of our daily life routine. We depend on them for work purposes, family needs, friends meetings, etc. The cars now allow us to access the Internet, make hands-free voice calls, navigate on autopilot mode, have the electronic maps directly in the dashboards, and so much more. But what is more important these days is that modern cars keep evolving due to the capacities of IoT and connected car apps development.\n\nWorld famous manufacturers like Nissan, AT&T, Volvo, General Motors, Renault and BMW gifted their clients with the best connected car apps that you can download right from the app stores. Such software allows users to personalize their cars, applying the latest technology achievements made by developers. Simply put, in term of functions the connected car apps are similar to the smartphone apps \u2014 they make driver\u2019s life so much easier.\n\nAnd the coolest part is that the smart cars market is expecting the new wave of IoT connected car apps that would be a focus for car makers of next generation. The concept has already become accepted by the mass market, so the app developers are totally prepared for the challenges of this new app development space. As for the entrepreneurs, they must be ready to capitalize on this technology trend. The experience of trailblazing brands that embraced the connected car apps development shows that the ROI index is perfectly satisfying for those businessmen who build software for connected cars.\n\nSo, let\u2019s review the best approaches on how to build something like BMW or Volvo connected car apps. Each one of them has already been tested and implemented in real life. You may choose the most likable of them for you to penetrate this market boom.\n\nSuch IVI systems typically provide drivers and passengers with entertainment and information delivery. In order to ensure this services, in-vehicle infotainment systems apps are allowed to use audio/video interfaces (A/V), two-way communications, vehicle voice commands, touchscreens, keypads, hands-free phone feature, etc. Most of the infotainment systems also provide security measures to prohibit drivers from using video features and other distracting services.\n\nThanks to these apps our cars process digital vehicle diagnostics, traffic information, cell phone calls and texts, emails, even warning and emergency help features. The app developers face the challenge of building connected car apps in a manner when a driver can receive the information without its interference with the actual driving. So, developing these apps isn\u2019t an easy task for amateurs. But the auto manufacturers offer guidelines for connected car apps.\n\nOnly the professionals from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) develop the IVI systems apps. And the most part of core dev projects are usually outsourced to the offshore app developers \u2014 they code the actual \u201cdigital brains\u201d for the cars. The external apps are useless without their primary integration with the OEM platforms. A connected car app will have to be embedded into the car\u2019s software by a car maker and integrated with the code of existing IVI system (Ford Sync, BlackBerry QNX CAR, Genivi, etc.).\n\nHere is, actually, a sweet spot for most app developers, since many OEMs don\u2019t think that smartphones aren\u2019t good enough for hosting the connected car apps. Smart services for drivers like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink offer a revolutionary approach to developing connected car apps. Such services use smartphones themselves as the IVI systems, while the vehicles would offer just an LCD touchscreen display on its dashboard.\n\nIt works pretty simply \u2014 a smartphone connects with an enabled car via private and protected API channel, then the app runs on a phone, but users see the visuals on a dashboard display or hear the audio through vehicle\u2019s speakers. These systems are called Over The Top (OTT) \u2014 a driver can use the full power of the phone for getting infotainment services and enjoy a much easier access to navigation and audio/video features while driving.\n\nWith such apps, there are some strict requirements from the car brands that must be met by software developers:\n\nHowever, the drawback, in this case, would be a compatibility issue \u2014 a smartphone and a car must have a perfectly compatible operational systems. These days, some car manufacturing brands even test the cross-platform compatibility for connected car apps.\n\nAnother popular approach to developing connected car apps is based on data gathering from the obligatory onboard diagnostic systems, currently known as OBD-II. It\u2019s a one-way data port that allows accessing a vehicle\u2019s data but cannot be used to control its inner systems \u2014 the port doesn\u2019t let developers access the OEM platform. The data stored in OBD-II is an empowering fundament for connected car apps development. Vendors from around the globe are already using the OBD-II to develop the most useful applications and devices.\n\nIn this technology, car apps run on a smartphone or in the Cloud, so the instant data is collected from gyroscope, accelerometer, and GPS while the vehicle is moving. This data gives a tremendous opportunity for app developers to analyze it and implement the results in coding practice, creating valuable algorithms for third-party usage. Right now only the U.S. uses the full potential of this app market.\n\nHowever, the power of OBD-II apps is far greater. Developers can analyze such thing as the real-time statistics about engine performance, acceleration, braking, fuel usage, and so on. This allows them to create software products that would be invaluable for the following options:\n\nSmartDeviceLink or SDL is an open-source library of the Ford Motor Company. This project gave app developers and automotive head unit creators an expandable software framework to build the brought-in applications that are then integrated into a head unit.\n\nIn short, SDL makes it possible to connect the IVI systems and smartphone apps, which gives the car manufacturers an opportunity to impress their clients with the best connected car apps. Here is what the SmartDeviceLink project is offering:\n\nFollowing the Ford Company, Toyota, Mazda, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki are joining the SmartDeviceLink Consortium to continue the development and implementation of this technology in their next-generation vehicles. They\u2019ve embraced the new business strategy \u2014 the more open and offering your products are, the more people they attract. We all use our cars and mobile phones\u2026 it\u2019s only reasonable, that mobile car apps will unite these two things for the mutual benefits of both customers and automakers.\n\nIt was a long time ago when clients were happy and satisfied just with the usual in-vehicle GPS, car-to-phone Bluetooth or traffic notifications. Now, the consumers are far more demanding when it comes to seamless communication between their gadgets. Drivers and passengers want to enjoy their favorite mobile apps while sitting in their cars. And the manufacturers are desperate to hold on to their customers so there is no other way than to implement some handshaking software.\n\nDevelopers know it as an API \u2014 application programming interface that plays a part of a bridge between a mobile app\u2019s interface, broadband Internet connectivity and the in-vehicle infotainment systems. In this case, the IoT technology presents tremendous opportunities when we talk about developing connected car apps. An API allows developers to bind together various technologies and tools, which often leads to important innovations in the mobile app field.\n\nWhen there is an established mobile connection between a manufacturer and a car, then a manufacturer is fully responsible for gathering and analyzing car\u2019s data. This information greatly helps to simplify the connected car apps development process. Also, if the brand incorporates secure APIs for each mobile OS there is a higher chance to win over a wider target audience that uses all popular models of smartphones. More importantly, another benefit for app developers would be creating the after-market APIs, since the car companies tend to outsource the development services for their onboard APIs from third-party professionals.\n\nThe growing popularity of IoT industry brings to the market a new business niche \u2014 connected car apps development which provides enormous opportunities for startups and app developers. The connected vehicle apps always target multiple layers of technology. So, the demand for these advanced applications will only rise during the next years.\n\nHowever, to succeed in this competitive business niche you\u2019ll have to not just choose the right connected car apps development approach but also partner with developers who have a thorough knowledge of automotive technology and software architecture. Only a professional outsource development agency will be able to deliver your idea from scratch to the top of the app market.\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed just a few of the approaches that you can use in connected car apps development. The industry will rapidly grow, so you\u2019ll have to follow the trends closely in order to choose the most profitable for your future goals.

Those risks may be financial, emotional, and / or territory-related.\n\nENTs demonstrate a multitude of characteristics: in theory, they are accountable, organized, confident, creative, and motivated. (Please don\u2019t hesitate to respond if I\u2019m missing something.)\n\nThey see opportunity, where others see a problem. ENTs use their knowledge and personal attributes to gather information, assemble a product or service, network, and pursue creation of value for the greater good of society.\n\nEveryday, more and more minds contemplate \u201cstarting something\u201d on their own. The Internet has made it easier than ever to develop and nurture new ideas for commerce.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons people aspire to become ENTs: to take control of work-life, to positively impact society, and of course, to receive a sizable profit.\n\nAbove all, I think people are tired of the standard 9\u20135 humdrum job.

        "title": "Why optimizing your life won\u2019t help your productivity",
        "text": "In the early days of a growing my start-up, I was working on every task that I could get my hands on, constantly adding points to my to-do list.\n\nWhen I started to slowly hire more people, the list didn\u2019t shorten.\n\nEventually, I was working on so many things, that, really, none of my tasks were getting done.\n\nI started to realize: the more tasks I work on, the less productive I am. But that was counterintuitive to the way we were told business works.\n\nOur mainstream start-up culture is always pushing optimization.\n\nThere\u2019s always a little bit further you can go, a little harder you can push, and if you don\u2019t try to the bitter end, then you\u2019ve failed.\n\nThough optimization \u2014 in theory \u2014 is important to growing your product, in practice \u2014 your day to day is also about getting stuff done. Not squeezing every last drop of success out of a given task, while ignoring the growing list of work below it.\n\nSo what is an alternative way to get things done?\n\nBasecamp\u2019s Jason Fried is a strong advocate of working smarter but not so hard and on so many things that he loses the game.\n\nOn the podcast Love Your Work, Fried explains that he\u2019s never been interested in extreme optimization or squeezing every last dime out of anything.\n\nThe growth hacking model, however, demands optimization at every turn. And it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hamster wheel of blowing your way through task upon task that can get you further ahead, especially when the mainstream media models it.\n\nBut Fried\u2019s success is an example of how doing less can actually get you more.\n\nYour brain needs what is called \u2018working memory\u2019 or temporary brain storage in order to think creatively and problem solve. An increasing number of studies find that when you have too many focuses, your brain can\u2019t find space for creative problem solving.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but as the founder of JotForm, a company with over 100 employees and 3.5 million users, I can\u2019t afford to keep spooning more onto my plate which will guarantee that there won\u2019t be enough space for it all.\n\nWould you rather accomplish a few tasks well or so-so a whole list of them?\n\nLet\u2019s look at how to get things done with fewer things to do.\n\nResearch shows that you are 2\u20133 times more likely to follow through on a new habit if you set out exactly when, where, and how you will accomplish the goal.\n\nWhen you hold yourself accountable, with a specified path for your tasks, studies prove that human behavior will respond positively.\n\nTake me for example. When I want to integrate a new habit into my schedule, I write it directly into my calendar, leaving a spot for a check mark when the goal is achieved. And if I don\u2019t make it happen, I get a big, red X instead.\n\nIt may sound adolescent, but it works. Nobody wants to see a big, red X on their calendar and eventually, giving yourself a check may become a highlight of your day.\n\nWhen you know that you have to do something, and you know exactly when and how you\u2019ll get it done, you\u2019re more likely to actually do it.\n\nThis intention implementation process forces you to get specific throughout your day, every day, until it\u2019s a habit.\n\nThough intention implementation is a great tool for productivity, it\u2019s not a miracle solution. There\u2019s still a catch.\n\nRemember Fried\u2019s advice about having less things to do? Intention implementation runs on the same model.\n\nSupplemental research has found that intention implementation is the most successful when you focus your time on one goal. The more you spread yourself, the more it\u2019s going to cost you.\n\nSo, how can you use this knowledge to increase your productivity at work?\n\nIf you want to develop a successful model of productivity, focus on one, two, or maybe three most important tasks (MITs).\n\nWhen you prioritize tasks as the absolute, most important things that need to be done for your product to succeed today, with exactly the hows and the whens of getting it done, you will increase your chances of doing it.\n\nJust sit down in the morning and ask yourself: what are the tasks I can do to make today successful?\n\nOnce you have your MITs, then do everything you can to support yourself in getting there. If the Twitter app isn\u2019t downloaded on my phone, then there\u2019s no way it can pull me in and suck away half an hour of productivity.\n\nAnd if everyone on your team is using the same model, then you\u2019ll all manage to check off MITs weekly, instead of getting parts of a lot of tasks halfway done.\n\nBusy work doesn\u2019t just disappear when you decide that you\u2019re going to give yourself less to do.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that switching between activities causes a 40% loss of productivity. Instead of getting them done when you find a moment, you can do them together, to the very end.\n\nWhen you give your brain one path to follow, it will be easier to get to the end of that path. You\u2019ll get into the groove of the task, which will make you more productive doing it.\n\nSo what can you do to make sure that you\u2019re being productive when presented with tedious or repetitive tasks?\n\nSome live by the \u2018Only Handle It Once\u2019 (OHIO) strategy \u2014 meaning that you should only deal with a task, one time, until it\u2019s done.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t always lead to the perfect solution. Sometimes you actually shouldn\u2019t force yourself to answer an email upon the first view if you need more information and time to respond appropriately.\n\nBut this tactic may actually help you frame the way you view your menial tasks. And maybe you\u2019ll find that paperwork actually can get done.\n\nWhen it comes to starting a business, it\u2019s a marathon. Especially when, like me, your plan is to grow your company slowly, without taking money from investors.\n\nYou will have years of doing the same tasks. It will be difficult to stay productive. It\u2019s taken me 12 years so far.\n\nThe best way to keep yourself in the long game? Focus only on today.\n\nWe often struggle with separating what we\u2019re doing today from what we need to do someday. The issue is: the someday is just made up of a bunch of todays.\n\nAlas, it is the great problem of akrasia, or the state of acting against your better judgement. When it comes to big, future desires, we often find that we default out of productivity in the moment.\n\nWhy? Because present us is more demanding than future us. Our present-self is driven by instant gratification while the future-self is motivated by long-term rewards.\n\nReframing the way you think about your tasks, the one on your to-do list today, really is the best way to make sure you not only get them done, but that you get them done well.\n\nWhen you start focusing on multiple tasks, you make more mistakes. And those mistakes will add up.\n\nHave fewer tasks and get them done right, rather than optimizing on work but providing mediocre returns.\n\nDavid Kadavy points out that doing less things doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re doing less stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s about ignoring the crumbs to pick up the whole loaf.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that you can\u2019t strive for perfection or let yourself imagine that your project is always ongoing with potential for alterations.\n\nBut by giving yourself an end in sight for your tasks, it means that you have something you\u2019re not just looking towards \u2014 but moving towards.\n\nAnd when that day comes, then you can get your spoon out and start again.\n\nIn the end, this model of working harder on less work sounds satisfying. And it can actually be successful, too.\n\nYou can follow this model and see results. Not just in your personal productivity, but in your team as well.\n\nCreating an environment in your company where people feel encouraged to take time on their tasks, instead of pushing to finish in order to move to the next, will create a better product.\n\nAnd in the end, isn\u2019t that the point of the optimization in the first place?"

        "title": "How We Bootstrapped Our No-Code Web Development Startup to a Team of 20 in 2 Years",
        "text": "This article is about how we bootstrapped Zeroqode in an absolutely new niche of No-Code web development. Using DIYs, wide community support, super efficient and affordable marketing we built our development shop from 3 people into a company of 20. The article tells how we are running 2 parallel brands of No-Code Services and No-Code Products. How we became global leaders in the no-code web development niche in less than 2 years, and what we learned along the way.\n\nFrom the age of 21 until 32 I was running multiple businesses, most of which were offline. At 32, I decided to take one year off, which in fact stretched over a few years. During this time I spent most of my energy on self growth and oriental practices, after which I decided it was time for me to do something real again :) .\n\nIn 2015, I had an idea for a niche social network but went on building what seemed to me a simpler product \u2014 a meditation app. I\u2019ve spent about $50K building it with very little payback (read more about this here). Because of this bad experience, I never wanted to hire developers again in order to implement a startup idea.\n\nHow the Idea was Born\n\nOne day, I received a newsletter from Product Hunt which featured Bubble \u2014 an easy to use no-code app building platform. I was intrigued and decided to give Bubble a try. At first, I was put off by their high price. At the time, Bubble was charging per number of visitors. I thought to myself, if the app I intend to build becomes very popular, my monthly overhead will grow far too high. When I checked back a few month later they changed the pricing strategy. Their charging model was now per workflow and it became much more affordable. (Recently, Bubble changed their pricing again and now their monthly plans start only at $14/month.)\n\nThis is when I really started to learn the platform. I quickly went through all their basic tutorials and found the builder to be very easy to use. I completed my app in only one week, and most of the time I was polishing the UI rather than building the core functionality.\n\nIn doing this, I realised I was more excited about the process of building rather than the application itself. This is where the idea crossed my mind \u2014 it would be cool to build applications without code for others!\n\nI was surprised to find out there were no other companies specializing on building apps without code. I reached out to Emmanuel Straschnov (co-founder of Bubble) and asked if they would be interested for us to become a Bubble partner and offer no-code web development services based on their platform. It turned out they were, in fact, going to launch their partner program shortly and it was the right time for me to approach Emmanuel.\n\nI decided to build a landing page and, because my design skills were lousy (still are to be honest), I found a freelance designer who produced the drafts at the cost of $200.\n\nI consider this to be the only investment I put into this business (well, plus the domain name). I called the company Bubblewits because I wanted to reiterate that we focus on web development using Bubble \u2014 I figured this would give a \u201cnewbie\u201d company more credibility in the eyes of potential clients.\n\nI started Bubblewits alone, but about 7 months later Vlad Larin joined me. We met at a coworking space we were residents of. Vlad and I were sharing a desk.\n\nIn my previous businesses I never had co-founders, preferring the one-man shows. This time, I learned it is great to have a partner you can rely on and share the responsibilities with.\n\nAt the beginning, we were focused on custom development services and only a few months later we built and published our first no-code app template, which became the foundation for Zeroqode.\n\nGetting customers was a whole process within itself and we had to come up with innovative and inexpensive ways to find them. Here is where the official partnership with Bubble came in handy. A significant amount of our clients were referred to us from Bubble\u2019s partner page. Also, we were always very active on Bubble Forum. We were helping other users by posting hacks and solutions for things that were complicated to build on Bubble and we were publishing updates about new products we built, like template and plugins.\n\nWe branched Zeroqode from Bubblewits out of the need for a better way to promote our products. Before Zeroqode, Bubble Template Marketplace page was the only place to show our products. As more templates were published by other users, the page became too crowded and therefore not structured to our benefit. We were looking for a better way to reach out to our customers and explain how the product works and why it is useful.\n\nWe launched Zeroqode by featuring our templates, then step by step more products (like plugins, no-code backends and web-to-native solutions) were added to our portfolio. Later on, we started featuring curated resources that teach how to build on Bubble.\n\nAll our products are built to help our customers develop their applications up to 10X times faster. No-code app Templates, for instance, are easy to set-up and affordable, they come with built-in functionality and reliable updates.These are not simply design mockups but finished, fully functional, responsive web applications, mostly recreating the functionality of well-known and proven websites or apps. The templates can be modified without code to launch any product faster and with way less costs involved. We have already published dozens of templates and keep building more \u2014 from templates that are similar to AirBNB, Linkedin, Instagram, Trello to Backend and Telegram Bots. The goal is to make Zeroqode for complex web applications what Themeforest/Wordpress have become for simpler websites.\n\nBootstrapping was never a planned approach. In our case, it was more like a circumstance \u2014 it happened naturally. When I thought about resources needed to start the company (landing page and domain name), I realised I only needed a couple hundred dollars and I knew I could afford the costs myself. I wasn\u2019t sure the whole idea would work, so it was just an experiment which turned out to be very successful.\n\nNone of my previous business were bootstrapped. My first startup was an IT company selling computers and providing IT services. In order to finance the operations, I got a loan from my parents and later a bigger one from a local bank. My other two businesses were related to long distance calling provider through callback and clothing retail operations. For both, I went through the same process. So bootstrapping is new to me.\n\nBootstrapping allowed us more flexibility and freedom in the decision making process. We were able to focus on taking the company toward the goals we set together as a team. When raising funds, often investors will blurr your goal with their own vision for your business.\n\nBootstrapping was an effective way to satisfy our hunger for doing business right. It pushed us to come up with quick and innovative ways for efficiency. It motivated us to get good at what we are doing in a minimal amount of time. We had no extra resources to waste on mistakes. When we failed, we learned so much more out of it just because it was way more painful. For instance, when you receive investment, you have enough funds to hire a team almost immediately. We hired the first employee only 3 months after launching, in May 2016. Our first employee was Anna \u2014 a great designer who never did any programming or coding. She learned the platform quickly and is now one of our most proficient Bubble designers/developers.\n\nWe were the first company in the world (and still are) who train designers to build functional apps without code. In this way, one person can build everything \u2014 design, database structure, workflows, APIs, etc.. We hire very carefully and only when we can afford it, but as our business has grown, we\u2019ve been able to grow from a team of 2 to a team of 20.\n\nAnother relevant example is marketing. The main challenge of any startup nowadays is marketing and promotion. Startups that get financing can allocate significant marketing budgets. Since we couldn\u2019t afford it, we had to look into guerilla marketing alternatives that wouldn\u2019t cost us much.\n\nThey say you need to spend money to make money, and in most cases this is true. But when you make a decision to bootstrap your startup, there is often a very limited budget to spend or spending money on marketing might not be an option at all. With this being our case we were pushed to be creative and come up with efficient and on budget marketing solutions.\n\nWhen I was working on building Zenify \u2014 the meditation application, I learned launching on Product Hunt was a very significant source of traffic and new users. So, we launched Zeroqode on Product Hunt as well. The launch was successful and we got the #3 Product of the Day badge, which gave us significant traffic boost (read more about How we got 800+ upvotes on Product Hunt). We also launched our new templates and side projects on Product Hunt to gather feedback and let the community know about our news. One of the most successful side project we\u2019ve built was Postman Collections which is the biggest library of API collections for Postman tool. This project was built on our Product Hunt clone template in 2 weeks only. We also launched our new products on Designer News and Hacker News for extra traction.\n\nTo focus our audience\u2019s attention even more, we launched two \u201cBest Startup Idea\u201d Competitions, where we gave away templates for first, second and third place. We announced the competition on platforms like Indie Hackers, Reddit, HackerNews and our forum.\n\nShowcasing your startup in an international conference is also a great way to let the world know about yourself. We were able to get sponsored by a local support organisation to exhibit at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin. At the conference we won an award called \u201cWild Card\u201d which gave us the opportunity to get interviewed for TechCrunch\u2019s news portal and get worldwide exposure (read what TechCrunch wrote about us and learn more about How We Won Wild Card at TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin).\n\nAnother conference we attended is STEP in Dubai, which allowed us to enlarge our audience even more, and connect with potential clients and partners from a totally new and unique region.\n\nWhen analyzing where the company should go moving forward, we decided to stay committed to bootstrapping. We do not require big budgets, unless we choose to spend a lot of money on marketing. Fortunately, our guerilla strategy is working well for us. At the moment, raising investment would distract us from running the business, forcing us to deal with all the formalities and procedures required to get funded. Also, we don\u2019t want to release control of the company and decision making process.\n\nYet, we will be revising our business strategy when we reach the next level, and make new decisions based on the situation at that moment in time.\n\nBootstrapping is not applicable for every startup out there. The decision to bootstrap does not have to be the only way and there is no ideal capitalization structure for growing a company.\n\nSome companies start off bootstrapping and later fundraise. Some never raise funds, while others don\u2019t stand a chance without investment. If you have a huge opportunity of disrupting the industry and fast execution and capital are core to your possibility of success, then seeking investment is probably the only way. Bootstrapping fits the opposite.\n\nWhile determining whether to bootstrap or seek investment, consider your priorities, opportunities, and your market dynamics. Then, make an educated choice that fits your scenario. We made ours, and it has been working great for us so far.\n\nJoin our newsletter to receive occasional tips about building products and startups without code."

        "title": "The 2 Qualities of Transformative Routines \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Very briefly, think about your goal.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019d like to write a novel. Spend a minute or two imagining what your future tome will look like, what color the cover will be, your mom\u2019s face when you giver her the first copy, etc.\n\nI hope you got your fill, because from here on out, your focus should be on routines not goals. You goal is your destination, whereas routines are the smaller actions that will get you to your goals if performed consistently.\n\nBench pressing 300lbs is a goal. Going to the gym every weekday after work is a routine.\n\nThese small routines will become reinforcement generators capable of supplying you with a stead stream of motivation to work through the inevitably difficult parts of your journey. Importantly, they must be small enough initially that the reinforcement you get out of them outweighs the difficulty.\n\nSo, think of a very small daily routine which, if you did it consistently, would eventually result in your final product or end result.\n\nTo stick with the novel writing example:\n\nInitially, your routine should be so small that you\u2019d have to try hard not to do it. Because momentum is everything in the beginning stages, you must make your routines smaller than you initially think you should so that you minimize the chances of the difficulty outweighing the benefits.\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a closer look at that.\n\nSuppose you only wrote 300 words 5 days a week for a year. That\u2019s about 78,000 words. War and Peace it is not, but it\u2019s still a lot of words. Guess how many words are in the first Harry Potter book?\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you\u2019re just slightly more ambitious and you did 300 words 5 days a week for a month. Then for the next 2 months you bumped it up to 500 words. And for the last 9 months you keep 500 words as your minimum but ended up averaging 700 words per day. That\u2019s 152,000 words in a year.\n\nHere are a few minor literary works you may have heard of with fewer than 152,000 words: A Tale of Two Cities, Schindler\u2019s List, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Wuthering Heights,and To Kill a Mocking Bird.\n\nSo, remember that meaningful goals and aspirations will always have difficult stretches. And in order to work through these difficult stretches you need a reliable source of motivation. Small reinforcing routines are the best way to generate this motivation. So invest in them early and often."

        "title": "Why Startups Should Build on Serverless Platforms in 2018",
        "text": "When you go to startup communities like r/startups or indie hackers you often see non-technical founders asking for advice about which tech they should use to build their app. Invariably these end up in flame wars about development languages and frameworks. For me, this is totally missing the point. Yes ensure you are using experienced, talented developers. But the language or frameworks they use matters far less than the cloud platform you build your foundations on. That platform should be serverless.\n\nServerless1is the umbrella term for the new breed of cloud services which do not require management of servers by customers. Hence server-less. It was first popularised by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2014 with the launch of their Lambda service. Since then AWS and other cloud providers have launched dozens more services, including databases, notifications and many more. The ecosystem has become so mature that large companies are now migrating their stacks wholesale to it.\n\nBecause provisioning (configuring and installing the correct software) and managing (ensuring they remain active and secure) servers has historically accounted for a large percentage of the overall time it takes to develop and maintain a web application. Apart from the cost savings it brings, serverless also reduces the time to market for new products and features.\n\nTraditionally you would need to have a server running 24/7 to keep your application live. With serverless you are only charged when your application actually receives a request. With this pricing model you can keep your costs down to a minimum whilst you build up your customer base.\n\nBeing able to deal with large numbers of users has been one of the hardest aspects of developing apps. With serverless, the cloud providers take on this responsibility and are able to do so on a massive scale, AWS claim that serverless is good for your \u201cfirst ten million customers\u201d.\n\nTraditionally startups would build a rough and ready first version which would need to be rebuilt from scratch as soon as they gained any traction. With serverless you no longer need to throw away your prototype when it becomes popular. If built correctly, it should scale to millions of users.\n\nIn 2018, serverless is a mature technology with companies fast adopting it. It has made building an MVP quicker and cheaper than ever before. If you are a founder the first thing you should be telling your developers is \u201cbuild on top of serverless platforms\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and want to read more like it then follow me on twitter or medium."

By that I mean, growing your business online and acquiring new customers through online marketing.\n\nOnline marketing success for a small business or freelancer is simple and looks like this:\n\nEach of these metrics feeds the other. You need traffic to generate leads, you need leads to generate proposals or sales.\n\nThe bottom line is easy to measure, where it gets tricky is figuring out why the bottom line is improving.\n\nIt\u2019s simple. You measure the above metrics.\n\nAs Einstein was famously known for saying:\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201d.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand what these metrics are or how to measure them, you can\u2019t begin to improve your online marketing success.\n\nThe key to achieving bottom line growth through any channel is to connect your channel metrics to your bottom line growth and know these metrics inside and out.\n\nIf you want to grow online, you need to rigidly measure your metrics.\n\nIf you want to grow through outbound sales, you need to know your metrics inside and out.\n\n100 calls will allow us to generate 3\u20135 proposals which will allow us to close 1\u20132 sales.\n\nThe same is true with online marketing success.\n\n100 unique visitors will result in 3\u20135 leads, which will us to generate 3\u20135 proposals and close 1\u20132 sales.\n\nOnce you understand your metrics, you can forecast. Once you can forecast, you can set targets. Once you can set targets, you can hit them, or then figure out why you didn\u2019t. Which allows you to critique your process and figure out where things are going wrong.\n\nIf your target is 2 new customers per month, reverse engineer it.\n\nDid you get your necessary 100 unique visitors? If yes:\n\nDid you get your necessary 3\u20135 leads? If yes:\n\nDid you put out your necessary 3\u20135 proposals? If yes:\n\nDid you get your 2 new customers? If no:\n\nWe can logically assume something went wrong at the proposal stage.\n\nAsk the customer why. Was the price too high? Did we not factor in some requirement that another vendor did?\n\nFigure out where you went wrong, then next month, don\u2019t make the same mistake. If you keep the rest of your metrics steady, you should then logically close these customers and grow your business.\n\nHopefully you found this useful.

        "text": "The Formula to Change Your Life\n\nAnd there\u2019s no doubt that there is something you want to improve in one specific area of your life. Today, I\u2019ll show you how, and share a proven formula for personal growth.\n\nThis method has helped me become a much better person over the years. It helped me stop swearing, overcome introverted tendencies that held me back in life, and even, as embarrassing as it is for me to admit, helped me drop by jerk-like habits and become a much more loving, open, and authentic leader.\n\nFortunately, this formula holds the same promise of change and power of personal growth for you.\n\nI\u2019ll explain it in a moment, but first, an odd story\u2026\n\nRecently I took a trip to San Diego for the annual Fitness Business Summit (FBS). On the third day of the event, I spoke from the stage and coached 1,000 entrepreneurs through a 10X business building session (but that\u2019s another story for another day).\n\nThere were other highlights, too.\n\nEvery year at the event I take on a crazy personal challenge.\n\nAt the 2017 FBS, I made a public declaration that my goal was to hug 100 people during the summit. That probably sounds easy to you.\n\nFor me, it was extremely uncomfortable. But I went after it with gusto \u2014 and a fair amount of awkwardness.\n\nWhile I fell short of the century mark, clocking only 91 hugs, the challenge helped me grow.\n\nI increased the level of difficulty this year. For 2018, I challenged myself to film 100 selfie videos with attendees and to post these on my social media pages.\n\nAt first, I resisted pulling out the camera. I feared asking people to film the video. I resisted putting in the effort to bring the energy to the video. I feared digging deeper in my questions because I wanted to rush through the video.\n\nBut I pushed through. Each video got easier. While I fell slightly short of my goal, I interviewed 83 attendees over the three-day summit.\n\nThe result was nothing short of magical. The challenge forced me to step outside of my comfort zone, and I discovered a few great things in the process:\n\nThink about it. This pattern of habit-building shows up everywhere in life.\n\nRemember the time you drank your first coffee? You might not have been a fan of the taste, but soon it became normal, and now it might even be an addiction.\n\nA shot of whiskey is nasty at first try. Then you build a tolerance, then a liking. Soon, for many, it becomes a crutch.\n\nGetting up early sucks. But with some effort, it can become your salvation. Eventually, it is both desired and needed.\n\nThis habit-building pattern can be used for growth or destruction, however. That choice is on us.\n\nBack to my FBS challenge. At first I resisted, then I accepted it, and eventually my mind embraced it and created a new level of performance.\n\nWhat was once resisted is now engrained. I cannot wait to do this over and over again.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the only one, either. People loved it! My interviews made them feel special and helped them grow and develop their on-camera skills as well.\n\nThe challenge confirmed for myself that pushing through barriers is the only thing that levels up a life.\n\nWant to grow? You must commit to this mindset.\n\nThe secret to success for personal growth and skill development is action and practice.\n\nTake action, action, and more action.\n\nThen review your \u201cpractice\u201d and get expert advice on how to become better.\n\nContinue this virtuous cycle over and over and over again \u2014 for your videos, podcasting, writing, leadership, meetings, conversations. Do it for every skill that needs improvement.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what you can do and who you can become when you regularly step outside your comfort zone.\n\nSo take up a new challenge today and see what becomes of it.\n\nThe lessons you learn might surprise you \u2014 just as the results of my 100 selfie video challenge did for me.\n\nMost importantly, your personal growth and evolution will move forward by leaps and bounds.\n\nNever let it end."

        "text": "No graphic designer? No problem! Check out these easy-to-use tools to DIY your images.\n\nIn the world of digital marketing, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that visual content has become a powerful tool for brands in running successful marketing campaigns.\n\nConsidering that 65% of people are visual learners and articles with images get 94% more views compared to those without, it makes perfect sense to create compelling images in all areas of your digital marketing efforts.\n\nHowever, hiring a professional graphic designer to give you high-quality images for your blog posts is expensive.\n\nSo how do other marketers edit their images without hiring a pro?\n\nThe solution is to DIY it!\n\nFortunately, there are some truly magical image editing tools designed for the technically challenged, and many of them are free to use or have low-cost plans.\n\nHere are 5 places to DIY your images:\n\nPiktochart is one of the most popular online tools that allow you to create graphics, presentations and even infographics.\n\nTheir mantra, \u2018Take your visual communication to the next level without hiring a graphic designer\u201d is true to its nature, since they\u2019ve helped a lot of marketers in create outstanding infographics over the years.\n\nWith Piktochart, all you need to do is to enter your data and choose a template and it automatically does the work for you.\n\nMakeaMeme or MAM is a completely free online tool you can use to make your own meme. It includes a library of images you can simply slap on a caption and download after registering. However, the site does not specify if the images are under copyright, so using them may land you in legal trouble if you use it for your business, especially if your post goes viral. It is far safer to use the meme generator, where you can upload your own image or a stock photo for commercial use.\n\nHere\u2019s one using an image from Pixabay, an equally magical site for free stock photos, illustrations, and videos:\n\nOther sites where you can find free and royalty-free images that require no attribution are MorgueFile and Public Domain Pictures.\n\nThis is an online tool for easily creating images. It has its own library of thousands of royalty-free images that you can simply drag and drop to the work space, manipulate, filter, and a host of other stuff. The tool also provides social media icons, quotes, and templates.\n\nYou can\u2019t simply copy and paste the image you\u2019ve made, however. You have to save it on Stencil and download it, which takes a while. At any rate, it is easy to use and the free version allows you to create up to 10 images a month, so it\u2019s all good.\n\nA blog is a useful marketing tool, more so if you can actively promote your brand through your visual content. A great tool for brand placement is PlaceIt, which lets you drag and drop your website\u2019s URL or any landing page for a product in any of the stock photos or videos it has in its library. Here\u2019s a sample using an image mockup:\n\nIt is free to use if you only need a small image (400x300 px) like the one above, but if you want high-res images, you have to pay per piece (from $8 up). You can also get 9 images a month for $29 or 31 images for $99.\n\nYou can also make demo videos, but there is no free version. You either pay per video ($29 or so) or pay $199 a month for unlimited videos and nine images.\n\nCanva is a nifty image-editing tool, which makes it easy to make professional-looking graphics without having any graphic design chops.\n\nYou can choose from pre-set templates, or create your own. Aside from photos, you can also create infographics. All you have to do is choose among the many design options and start playing! Some photos and layouts carry a small price tag, but there are many of free ones as well.

        "title": "How I launched a UI/UX Startup which earned $9.000 in first two months?",
        "text": "How I launched a UI/UX Startup which earned $9.000 in first two months?\n\nAt the time of writing my latest project learnux.io has been out for over two months. Over this time, the webpage has been visited by 20,000 users from 145 countries, generating almost 70,000 hits. Over 220 people have subscribed which resulted in $9,000 revenue over this time. The last 30 days of income presents as follows: I guess you must be wondering what learnux.io is. It\u2019s a website which offers access to video courses in the field of user interface design and learning tools for UI/UX designers. I would like to share a few tips with you which might be helpful for creation of your own, similar products. I hope that the story of learnux.io will be a valuable lesson for you. I tried to describe it so that it contains a series of hints and conclusions at which I arrived while working on a startup.\n\nThe work on the project started circa six months before it was launched and I treated it as a \u201cside project\u201d at that time. The idea came quite naturally \u2014 it is a mix of what I do for a living, which is practical design work and video courses which I have been doing for many years now by maintaining eduweb.pl in Poland. One of the best ways you can choose to create a new product is by finding a solution to the problem you have. The product can be e.g. a SAAS solution. Approaching the problem from other side, you can deliver knowledge how to solve the problem. I started by defining the problem and decided that it was a need for learning new solutions and willingness to keep in touch with the latest UI/UX novelties. In order to keep up with constantly changing trends, designers must devote a lot of time for research and experiments. It\u2019d be good to have a valid, updated source of knowledge. Time is money which leads us to a conclusion that maybe someone will be willing to pay for obtaining this knowledge using shortcuts. By dissecting the problem, you can get a lot information from it: whose problem is solved by the product (UI/UX designers), how can you talk about it (it is an investment which will pay off in effectiveness), it is paid, what features it should have (the most specific and professional). Such formulated preliminary premises accompanied my beginning of work. Of course, I was aware of the fact that I might miss it, however, there\u2019s nothing wrong in readjustment of the course. Simply, you just have to bet on something. Regularly put down problems which you come across. Maybe finding a solution to those problems can be an idea for the next product. I\u2019m using Trello board, but you might as well use your favourite notebook. Usually it is not a good idea to light up straight after noting the problem down. Let the problem occur a couple of times in your notes and take care of its preliminary validation. It\u2019s important to split the ideas into small steps so that they won\u2019t overwhelm you. Also, don\u2019t force the ideas to appear and try to understand your approach first. After you write them down. let them lay for a while. If you don\u2019t know where to start, try getting some inspiration such as this one.\n\nThere are many examples of online businesses which were created and developed basing on the ignorance of their creators. They admit that if they had done a profound research of the topic and competition they probably would never start a given project. After all, they succeeded by believing that their solution has a unique market value, but most importantly, by designing it in a way that they would like to use on their own. I, however, have created many online products and one of the things that doesn\u2019t move me at all is risk and hyperoptimism. This is why I tried to conduct an observant validation of the idea, as well as analyse brand trends to diagnose possible risks. This stage will be chiefly based on the answer to the question: \u201cAm I not the only person who has a similar idea?\u201d. I haven\u2019t done the typical SWOT analysis, but I devoted a large amount of time on reading opinions of other UI designers, direction analysis of the software and reading articles on trends on Medium. Look through Facebook groups, forums, reddit, Slack channels and the like. Assess if others have a similar problem to yours. Use tools such as Google Trends to discover tendencies in the field of your product. If you do not have a specific idea, follow websites such as The Next Web, Tech Crunch, The Verge. As I mentioned before, I don\u2019t really believe in luck. I rather assume that the people who do the same things as you but better, have just worked harder/longer for it. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s what you wanted to hear and you might disagree with me by citing people who made a lot of money on products which didn\u2019t require a lot of work. However, often when you look into details you will see there\u2019s much more to it. And yes\u2026 you can also win in a lottery. It is quite possible that you\u2019re smarter than me and you will consciously select a different strategy. I\u2019m not special, I\u2019m hard-working. This is why I also don\u2019t believe the rule of thumb, that 90% of startups fail (but the mistakes they do are worth knowing). It is possible that it\u2019s not the way it should be done \u2014 in numerous interviews the originators of tech startups mention that they are lazy. Meaning, they want to make their lives easier so they search for solutions other than work which will help them achieve their goal. It\u2019s \u201ccreative laziness\u201d. If I was to be an example for someone there\u2019s good news that if you aren\u2019t lazy, there\u2019s still a chance that you\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019ll risk a statement that putting a lot of work in a project is a warranty of its success whereas whether it would be spectacular is a result of good timing and validation. In learnux I put ca. 1000 working hours, while ~70% was devoted to creation of a perfect product, where the remaining ~30% was spent on promotion, networking and things you\u2019ll learn about in a while. Probably other way can be chosen or the ratio can even be reversed with a better outcome. However, I feel that the matter is my strong feat, not marketing, this is why I placed my bet on what\u2019s safe. Before I created content, I checked thoroughly competitive resources and came up with the idea, according to the book \u201cZero to One\u201d by Peter Thiel, on how to do what has been already created, yet ten times better. This article might also inspire you. I\u2019m a fair believer in bootsrapping, especially in the early stages of your project, but I tend to treat myself as my own investor and keep this rules in mind.\n\nI decided to create a complete project of a UI application of a smart house which will join the whole material, to create courses which are logically connected, specific, well-paced, engaging, in 5k quality and brimful of practical tips. And then I just did it. It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done in my life. Although all the elements centred around the project are really interesting for me, it was neither easy nor pleasant. I\u2019ve heard that if you do what you like, then you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. It\u2019s a lie. Prepare a list of things which could be done better than by competitive products. If these are popular products, focus on specialisation. Find people who use competitive products. Ask if the thing you\u2019re trying to improve would make them choose your product. Start keeping a list of such people. I used a Google Docs spreadsheet. Prepare a list of steps which will lead to creation of your product. Set a specific deadline for each stage. Be consistent. The plan is dependent on the product. I noticed that there\u2019s nothing better than dissecting it and crossing out minor goals. Create your MVP. Simply start, but also finish. I know it\u2019s trivial, but I\u2019ve seen many successful people just acting, not overthinking it with great results. This article will also give you an idea of what I mean. I mentioned before that the key to success is composed of a great product + good timing + validation. Not competition! The existence of competition in a given product is a positive element of validation. It can prove the thesis that the problem exists and someone is ready to pay for its solution. When creating a product which isn\u2019t yet available on the market it can turn out that people are not ready to pay for it. Whereas while entering even the most competitive markets you can be sure that there\u2019s money on it. Therefore, what you need to do is simply to deliver a product that is better than that of competition. The \u201cbetterness\u201d can be guaranteed by narrower specialisation. Let\u2019s take Slack, for instance, which revolutionised work of thousands of teams all over the world by being simply just another communicator. By following different startups, I realised that having a slightly better product does not have to be a warranty of success. If, for instance, someone would come up with a better version of Twitter, you\u2019d come across a number of obstacles such as pre-existing habits of users, as well as the fact that they have already invested a lot of their time on expanding contact networks, followers and reputation. What it means is that if you want to create a visibly better product on a competitive market, it has to be, first and foremost, really better, and secondly, it has to take into account a convenient path of transition for its users. Generally \u2014 don\u2019t worry about competition. In spite of appearances, behind each of the competitive companies are people who are closer to you than you\u2019d think and they struggle with similar problems on daily basis. Be alert (use e.g. Similar Web and Alexa), do not ignore signs from the market, but do what you do and remain consistent. Prepare a list of keywords which describe your product well. You can use your AdWords account or Keyword Planner. Learn also how to use advanced phrases in Google. Google up those words \u2014 put down companies which are highly positioned and look into their products. Set up an account at Mention or Brand24. Monitor phrases which you identified as key ones, as well as the names of the companies offering similar competitive products. At the moment when I had an already defined vision of the product, I started coming up with a name, bought a domain (cheap .io domains are available at namecheap.com) along with hosting in the US and I set up a really simple landing page with info about what will be placed on the webpage. All these steps took me no more than a few hours, including content creation and simple search engine optimization (using proper webpage title or headings). At this stage I already used Analytics and set up an account at Google Webmaster Tools to check how the page will be indexed. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to this stage, but it surely did it good. Secondly, I set the premiere date and launched a simple counter with a possibility of signing up for the notification. The list gave me 76 e-mail addresses, redirecting the traffic from the article in which I announced the premiere to the counter. Buy a domain and hosting on servers in a target country. Set up a simple landing page adjusted to SEO and set a launch date for your product. You can say that I started from the lowest of low levels. Never before have I created any content in English, I didn\u2019t have a personal brand abroad nor a list of e-mails or even friends who would be interested in my product and willing to recommend it. I started my work from building reach and finding my way into the business. I started from publishing articles at Medium. I tried to provide them with unique quality, for some of them I even prepared films which I placed on my YouTube channel. In this way I was simultaneously building reach via both websites, though my contents stood up among mostly text-based content at Medium. The best articles are the ones which have a perfect timing \u2014 concern a brand novelty, a topic which is picked up by many people at a given time. In this way for one of the best articles I was able to generate 3,000 hits on the first day and more than 15,000 hits up to today in a few months\u2019 time. Writing each article didn\u2019t take me more than two days and generated about a few thousands of hits. Grammarly and Hemingway App are very useful when you\u2019re writing in English. Converting traffic from this type of content ain\u2019t easy \u2014 you can plug in Upscri.be which will let people subscribe on your list. I relatively quickly gave up on this solution as it brought about only a few leads. I placed my bet on building recognition and a base of people who followed my profile. Over this time, I gathered more than 600. I linked articles and films created in such a way on particular groups on Facebook, such as Sketch Together, which helped me gain recognition and reach for my articles. Another way for building a list was creation of free resource which could be downloaded by providing an e-mail. By linking it on a few Facebook groups I tried to hit the right time and I gained 500 additional addresses. In this way by devoting ca. 100 hours for creation of additional content I gained fair reach \u2014 around 600 addresses on the list, the same number of followers on Medium, over 3,000 subscribers on YouTube, almost 100,000 views (I created four valuable films). It means that by investing a relatively small amount of resources I was able to reach with every newly published content a group of more than 4,200 nonrandom people who made a particular action to receive notification. React to brand novelties by publishing materials when people are searching for them. Spend some time on preparation of a small amount, but highly valuable contents. Diversify the channels and publish contents on websites which are visited by people potentially interested in your product. Through the whole time of preparation, I kept my Twitter updated, publishing even up to eight tweets per day which allowed me to gain ca. 300 followers. It is difficult to assess the real influence of Twitter on the success of learnux.io, but one I know for sure \u2014 it was Twitter which allowed me to get in touch with producers of software which I discuss in my courses, brand websites with novelties and also with some of the influencers. Reaching out to a person on Twitter usually requires commenting one or two tweets and retweeting two or three next ones. Next, it is worth to send a private message to that person or mention them in your tweet. In this time I was also active on other social media websites \u2014 Facebook, Quora, Reddit and Product Hunt. These are services in which you can successfully promote your startup. However, first you must gain reputation by writing valuable comments and helping others in evaluation and development of their products or by linking to valuable resources. The same can be done on various sector groups on Facebook. If I were to briefly assess the channels: Facebook \u2014 It is hard to build reach without a marketing budget, while using extra funds requires a lot of time for preparation of ads. I didn\u2019t focus much on this channel. Twitter \u2014 The best place for gaining industry contacts, requires being familiar with the specifics, but generates highly profitable outcomes. Reddit \u2014 Relatively low effectiveness, it is possible that the subreddits connected with UX were too niche so I just decided to let it go. Product Hunt \u2014 Highly valuable response and help of the startup society, also high traffic during the premiere. Because I wanted to focus on the making of courses and I avoided distracting notifications I used the help of Kasia who kept on sending me links to topics in which I could help substantively. I usually spent about half an hour a day doing this. In order to make our action successful we kept a spreadsheet on Google Docs with all the replies/advice given. I tried to list addresses to people to whom I replied. During the premiere we asked them a favour to rate our project \u2014 it worked! If you still don\u2019t have it, set up a Twitter account. Start following all industry influencers. Retweet their content and comment it from time to time. Tweet interesting things with a lot of hashtags and slowly build reach. Set up an account on Quora, Product Hunt and Reddit, join environments such as r/startups or r/enterpreneur and the ones connected to your industry. Keep posting as often as you can, make sure that what you post is uniquely valuable though. Join the communities on Facebook, Slack and others in which you\u2019ll be able to find your prospective clients. About a month before the launch I started looking for people who could help me with the promotion of the project. For searching you can use tools such as Buzzsumo or search on your own on social media and YouTube. It is good to prepare a Google spreadsheet with all the prospects you\u2019ll gather this way. Eventually, I tried to conduct all the communication via e-mail to store everything in one place. E-mail address can be found fairly easily, you can use tools such as Hunter, as well as this article. You can also extract e-mails from Facebook groups, for instance using Grouply. To be honest, I didn\u2019t focus much on such growth hacks, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re quite worth the time and ethically, not my first choice. Concentrating channel of communication with partners and influencer helped me successfully manage them using CRM Streak for Gmail where I could create separate pipelines for influencers, software producers or for industry websites. Exemplary pipeline looked like this:\n\nI tried to use unusual ways to reach out to influencers who could help me with the promotion of the project. I recorded a several dozen of short, personalised video messages which I included in the e-mail. I really wanted to compress the video so it could be carried in Gmail attachment. Almost half of the people responded to such a message. Although I tried my best to prepare for the launch, I think that at this stage I committed a few mistakes. It seems that I cared more about building interest in the upcoming product than about validation which I finished before. As a result, I devoted a lot of resources for actions which would bring more favourable outcome if implemented later. As it turned out, it is much easier to promote an already existing product than promise of that product. The same people who didn\u2019t respond to my message, replied later on to my follow up which I sent after the premier with the link to the project. When the project was live I had a lot more fun and motivation for promoting it. If I could do it again, I would definitely spend less time on looking for support before the launch of the project. Create a list of influencers and the most popular industry companies which could help you in the promotion of the project. You can also use paid tools such as Revfluence. I haven\u2019t used them on my own so I can\u2019t assess their effectiveness. Prepare CRM for contact management. The list will grow over time. Use supporting tools, for instance, Mailtrack helps you track whether a person has read your message. There\u2019s a cool article and a list of other useful tools here. Do not focus too much on making a buzz before the premiere, unless you have better ideas than I had. I started building suspense about 2\u20133 weeks before the premiere. I wrote a post on Medium in which I explained who I was and what problem is solved by my startup. I also placed a Call To Action, a request to fill in a simple questionnaire which helped me gain another 32 contacts. I regularly kept posting on social media with the countdown to the launch of the project. I freshened up some contacts I made before with influencers. Next, I focused on activisation of people who signed up on the mailing list. Altogether I sent them four messages before the launch. The statistics look as follows (penultimate column is an open rate, the last one \u2014 click rate).\n\nApart from the second message which contained an image which probably placed it in a different tab in Gmail, the remaining messages had a high open rate reaching more than 40% which only confirmed that I managed to collect quality e-mail addresses. The messages contained what follows (in order of sending): Information about scheduled launch + CTA \u2014 fill in the questionnaire My story + CTA \u2014 fill in the questionnaire Three free tutorials which I previously published on YT and Medium + launch reminder + CTA \u2014 let your friends know about the launch (click to tweet) Unique, free tutorial for subscribers only + launch reminder + information about promotion for subscribers for the first week Mail on the day of the launch was connected with adding the product on Product Hunt and it looked like that: On the next day I sent the subsequent e-mail, in three days another one which informed about expiring time of -20% promotion for start. It means that in two weeks (before and after the launch) I was sending messages every second day. The number of people who resigned from the Newsletter \u2014 0. The conversion from the list to the registered users \u2014 almost 20%. I think that it\u2019s a proof of how it\u2019s good to invest in the quality, not quantity, and not to be scared of sending out e-mails too often. Small lists can also convert very well. Prepare communication templates before/during the premiere so that it\u2019s ready for sending. Share your story \u2014 tell your users who you are, what problem you\u2019re solving and prove that you believe in it. I don\u2019t think that I managed to create the atmosphere of waiting for my product. When the counter stopped, there were just a few people on the webpage and probably I was the most excited one. With the hindsight I think now that it\u2019s not worth it to get all lit up by the launch itself. As I mentioned before, the promotion before the launch doesn\u2019t pay off well, and a side effect of making too much hype can result in a high number of hits at the beginning, but can also cause a sudden drop in interest after a while. It\u2019s better to build audience measurement systematically and watch the bars grow gradually rather than to have a great peak at the beginning and big turnover later. On the other hand, this is the specificity of the first product. The effect of waiting can be more easily achieved when we\u2019ve already got some history and attached customers. If it\u2019s our first product, it\u2019s better to relocate the resources into its better development rather than coming up with the premiere strategy. What is more important is what follows. It\u2019s good to create a number of descriptions (short, medium, long), press pack, pictures in different seizes or prepare and plan posts on Social Media beforehand, for instance using Buffer. I tried to send those materials to the biggest possible number of editorial offices, influencers I reached out to or industry websites. It\u2019s good to prepare your own list, basing on this one, enriched with industry websites working in the field of your product. By the way \u2014 this list curated by Lisa Dziuba is quite amazing, partly I was glad I haven\u2019t found it before the launch as I\u2019d probably spent too much time reading. Prepare resources required for launch. Different types of descriptions, screens, press pack. Make a list of websites and people you\u2019ll inform about the premiere of your product. The post-launch strategy in the case of learnux.io is based chiefly on one rule: systematicity. Every month I send mailing to the base of subscribers and update materials with new contents. I realized how great effects can cause a little amount of systematic work, for instance in strategy of building links. Imagine that you\u2019re devoting 15 minutes a day on helping others on different websites such as Quora. By writing one or two posts per day you\u2019re able to build ~300\u2013600 links a year! I also stay active on social media and I\u2019m gradually considering channelling a certain amount of income for paid advertisement. I talk a lot with my clients by listening to their opinions and automising collection of feedback and proposals of future materials using Intercom. I also configured simple analytics which allows me to measure key metrics such as quantity and source of registration and subscription. I upgrade the various functions on the website. For instance, by watching a few recordings collected by HotJar I realised that many people use hamburger menu so I added more translucent section structure and log-in option. I also noticed that not so many people recommend learnux.io using the referral system and I intend to redo it in a way that it doesn\u2019t offer immediate gratification (free month) at the beginning, but activate the users only after they started using the service and are pleased with it. Basically, it\u2019s obvious \u2014 you are ready to recommend a website only when you\u2019re convinced of its quality. Until I analysed the referrals statistics and started to think about the reason for such a small number of referrals, it wasn\u2019t so obvious back then. I am also trying to create at least one post a month for Medium/YouTube, as well as keep up and make new contacts with industry companies and influencers. My remarks regarding paid promotion boil down to one \u2014 don\u2019t do it. None of the channels I tested appeared to be effective. Creating ads on Facebook takes a lot of time and has a disproportionate outcome. AdWords and LinkedIn are very expensive for start and there\u2019s only a slight chance that this will pay for itself. I quickly realised that I had to burn a lot of money for ads in order to learn what works in a given situation. I decided not to waste time on it. In the future maybe I\u2019ll use the potential of Lead Ads on Facebook, however, from my experience I know that collection of contacts in this way is cheap only when our landing page is strictly connected with the content of the form. I also haven\u2019t received a valuable payback from commission meaning that for instance sending discount codes through partners. In my opinion the time for making a deal, the necessity of lowering the price, often by 40\u201350% (so that the discount is not only for subscribers but also the commission for the partner) is disproportionate against the benefits. Not to mention the fact that really valuable partners will not work like this with a startup. What to do? Instead of paid advertisement, try content marketing and generating valuable content \u2014 articles or freebies. Instead of buying ads, write posts on a blog and take care of building links. Instead of getting involved in a partnership programme, spend some time on talking with your clients and you\u2019ll see that it generates additional value. Instead of organising press conferences and inviting partners to dinners, share your products for free and only then ask if the product was useful and ask for review. By the way, another advice: never ask for more than a feedback, especially from influencers. You\u2019ll see that when they notice the value in your product, they\u2019ll be the ones to recommend it on their own. This is one of the messages I received:\n\nThis is just one of many non-standard strategies I decided to implement. The other example can be the one that at the beginning \u2014 all classes as a part of the website are open \u2014 in other words \u2014 everyone can view a random lesson. This strategy allows me to link to specific lessons (or even to a specific second of a film), where after the click you begin watching. Just after some time the AI on the website assesses whether you\u2019re ready to pay for the subscription and this is when it blocks the access to the next lessons. For a part of users, it is possible that they\u2019ll see what they came for without buying the subscription. This allows for a wide promotion, for instance on Quora, where I can place links to materials. Although I\u2019m working on delivering a clear message that the content is paid which is important and fair. Another partisan method is redirecting to the webpage with a parameter, which adjusts it to the recipient. For instance, if I promote my product on the discussion group connected to Sketch I can provide a special link https://learnux.io?c=8 which will replace the images on the page with the ones connected with Sketch, and in this way, they will profile a service for a specific recipient. Ouch! hope they\u2019re not listening ;) I hope that you enjoyed this article. I tried to keep it to the point and leave some action triggers that might help you with your own startup.

        "text": "Your cofounder and you have been dreaming of starting out on your brand new startup idea. As you divided up the responsibilities, you got to own marketing! Yay. There\u2019s just one problem.\n\nYou have never done marketing before.\n\nThankfully, with digital marketing, there are a lot of ways to get started. There\u2019s SEO, social media, ads on Google/Facebook/Instagram and whatnot. You think it is going to be simple because there\u2019s so much written out there on digital marketing, you can just coach yourself real quick.\n\nWait. The problem isn\u2019t that there\u2019s a lack of resources on digital marketing. The problem is that there are too many resources. And everyone seems to be giving you contradictory advice. Not to worry, the best way forward is to simply set up the right infrastructure and learn directly from your customers. Read along.\n\nThe first step to creating an effective marketing strategy is to identify who it is directed toward. When I started my first company: a portal for users to trade-in their old video games, the key customer for us was the console gamer from a middle-class household who couldn\u2019t afford to pay $60 for a video game. He was likely still in school or college, and didn\u2019t have a steady income.\n\nSocial media is no use for you if your customer isn\u2019t on social media. Find out first where the customer spends his time \u2014 whether online or offline. If online, then when does he get online to (say) make a purchase. For instance, in India, majority of e-commerce purchases happen during office hours (!) through the desktop and around midnight through mobile. But you can\u2019t assume the same works for all audiences. Hypothetically, if your core customer base comprises bank employees, then they likely don\u2019t follow the above trend since most banks limit internet access at work.\n\nBy now, you know where your audience hangs. Make sure you\u2019re on the social media platforms where your customers are. And then, also create accounts on platforms where your customers currently aren\u2019t. This will prevent others (spammers, spoofers, and competition) from creating similar-sounding brand accounts.\n\nThis is going to be the most important tactical thing you will do. First things first, you need to know where your audience is coming from and what they look like. This is typically done by embedding some cookies or pixels from trackers.\n\nStart with setting up Google Analytics on your website. Thankfully, it is quite a simple process, as Google outlines quite nicely here. Once you\u2019re done, you should be able to see the number of visitors coming to your website, the locations they\u2019re coming from, and the devices they\u2019re using to access your website.\n\nHowever, you also need to find out what other websites they\u2019re coming from. Here\u2019s where a nifty bit of playing around with the urls comes in helpful. When you share your links online through Facebook, Twitter, or any other medium, you can add some simple \u201ctags\u201d to those links to help you understand where the traffic is coming from. To add these tags, simply head over to Google\u2019s Campaign URL Builder and fill up the form.\n\nNow, every time you share your links online either organically or through your ads, simply add the tags specifying the source and you\u2019re done!\n\nNext, you have to set up the ad accounts for your business. Head over to Google and Facebook Business Manager and set up your business ad accounts. This isn\u2019t a How To article, so I won\u2019t go too deep into those steps. Keep in mind the following though:\n\nBut before you do that, ask yourself if you are ready to post regularly. If you can\u2019t guarantee that you will find the time to write something every few days, then skip this. That said, keep in mind that a well-executed content strategy can help you save thousands of dollars in ad spend, as well as build a long-term brand with customers. If you do set up a blog page, I\u2019d suggest using WordPress \u2014 it\u2019s simple enough to get started with and easy to get multiple team members to contribute.\n\nThen start writing about what value your business can add. Pay little attention to what the SEO gurus say \u2014 as long as you\u2019re creating high-quality content, there\u2019s no need to try and game the algorithm. If you\u2019re using WordPress, I suggest using Yoast\u2019s SEO plugin to get some good advice on the go as you\u2019re writing your blog posts. Yoast advice is not intrusive and helps you write and tag your articles effectively."

        "text": "When it comes to meeting new people, the best conversationalists approach their job with one goal in mind \u2014 advance.\n\nPeople who are great at starting conversations come in all shapes and sizes, but the underlying lesson all of them have learned is that people like to talk about themselves.\n\nThey use this to their advantage by asking a question that allows them to create a small opening, and inch by inch, they move the conversation forward until interest is generated, and ultimately, trust is built, so a second conversation is earned.\n\nLike the quote above says, building relationships is not only about showcasing your good qualities, but bringing them out in other people (which is the best quality).\n\nThe purpose of the list of conversations starters below is to give you a few ideas that will allow you to \u201cspot that small opening\u201d \u2014 so you can minimize the small talk in your life, meet more interesting people (which is everyone if you ask the right questions) and build more win-win relationships.\n\nSome of the questions below you may find cheesy, some may hit home \u2014 So grab a few you connect with and make them your own.\n\nFor the longest time I thought that having a few big name magazine logos on my back was the coolest part about writing. Then I realised that influencers were a little bit more likely to talk to me. It was not until recently my eyes opened to the true power of writing: I have carte blanche to talk to anyone.\n\nI can now reframe every question from \u201cSorry to bother you, do you mind if I ask you a question?\u201d to \u201cHey guys, sorry to interrupt. I am working on an article and the last few weeks I have been asking everyone I meet this one question\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nBut in reality, writer or not \u2014 \u201cThe last few weeks I have been asking everyone I meet this one question\u2026\u2026\u201d is just as effective. It gets people interested in what you are about to say and is a refreshing change from the standard, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d type of question.\n\nI love life lessons and career/life advice so the questions below are what I use, but with that intro it can go any number of ways.\n\nAll of the questions above work well one on one and in group settings, and all of them generate more than one word answers \u2014 which is the enemy of all conversations. They open people up to talk about the lessons they have learned, while dropping hints about who they are and if their values align with yours in a way that is unexpected and a nice change to the standard conversation starters.\n\nSpeaking of group settings, if you are not comfortable being the center of attention (even though the questions above are perfect for introverts as after one question you can shut up and still be deemed as interesting) or are shy and prefer to speak to people individually, give the compliment plus guess equation a shot.\n\nOr it can be as simple as\u2026.\n\nThe next time you meet someone and have the urge to resort back to the old, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d question, stop yourself, and try this reframe instead:\n\nThis simple switch lightens the conversation and turns a one word answer (again \u2014 your enemy), into a fun conversation.\n\nOther questions that work just as well:\n\nThe questions vary and need to be tailored depending on the conversation and circumstances, but they open people up to who they are, while giving them a chance to showcase their personality and what is important to them.\n\nLike I said in the intro \u2014 People like to talk about themselves, so do not make it harder than it has to be and ask a question that allows them to do just that."

        "text": "In order for your subconscious mind to do its work, you need to give it the space it needs. That means, there need to be plenty of periods, where you are not actively focused on something.\n\nThis could be one of two things:\n\nIf you want to be serious about using the power of your subconscious mind, then you should deliberately schedule periods like this into your daily schedule.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, they are not exactly \u2018first priority\u2019 activities.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to make the active decision that you are going to make space for them.\n\nIt is not enough to just have occasional periods where you are allowing yourself to be in a state of unfocus. If you are not giving your brain enough of these periods, then it will forcefully take them.\n\nThis means that while you are trying to focus on your work, your brain will start making you to daydream and mind wander.\n\nI doubt that this is what you want.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to bring a proper rhythm between periods of focus, and periods of unfocus into your life.\n\nDr. Srini Pillay recommends that for every 45 minutes, you should give yourself at least 15 minutes of unfocus. I myself have a similar rhythm. I work in 90 minute peridos, and then give myself at least 30 minutes of quiet time.\n\nBut that is not enough.\n\nIn addition to the break times which you have throughout your day, you should also plan in plenty of unfocused time during your spare time.\n\nThat means not filling up all of your spare time with activities that require you to spend a lot active attention. But to also give yourself some low intensive periods, where your subconsciousness has time to do its thing."

        "title": "Are you rational, logical and reasonable? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "I am one of the most rational, logical and reasonable people that I know. My favourite subjects at school were Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. I majored in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as an Engineering Manager leading teams of very logical and technical people, aka developers. I have no problem making reasonable requests, coming up with solutions, solving problems and being able to differentiate between rights and wrongs.\n\nHowever, my very rational, logical and reasonable thinking is also one that holds me back a lot. How could it be, I hear you ask. I couldn\u2019t believe it either but since two years ago, I have started being more conscious with my decisions and I have realised how my logical thinking holds me back.\n\nWhen I was young, I wanted to be a singer and a doctor. I didn\u2019t pursue either dreams because I said to myself that according to statistics, it was so hard to make a living as a singer. Going to a medical college wasn\u2019t in my family\u2019s plan when we moved to a different country just when I was in the last year of high school. The truth is, I didn\u2019t even fight for any of my childhood dreams. I thought through the options I had and be ok with them because that was the logical thing to do.\n\nAnd then when I started working at my first desk job, I was so underpaid. I knew I was underpaid when I got the job offer but I accepted it anyway. I said to myself that the pay was reasonable for me because I had little expenses and I could still make ends meet.\n\nWhen I was working as a freelance web developer making websites for small businesses, I would not put \u201cWebsite by\u201d attribution in the footer because I thought only web development companies or agencies should be eligible doing that. I, as a sole trader, had no business trying to promote my work.\n\nWhen I was about to shut down my startup, I didn\u2019t think about selling it off to someone else to take over because in my mind, the business idea was very simple that anyone could do it. They didn\u2019t need to buy it from me. (Side note: My startup was a shopping aggregator platform with a personal shopper service and style advice.)\n\nYou see, I had always been rational, logical and reasonable. I can easily talk myself out of anything I want to or do not want to do. I can find a logical reason for just about anything.\n\nAs a result, I missed out on a lot of opportunities and experiences.\n\nIt is not to say I don\u2019t have a good life because I do, good and safe, but I will never know what could have been would I have made different decisions. Would I be doing a world tour right now if I had fought for and chosen a different career path?\n\nA lot of people say fear holds them back from achieving what they want in life. Me? Fear doesn\u2019t have a chance because my amazing thinking skill has already turned that fear into something very reasonable, rational and logical reason.\n\nWhat exactly do I mean by the above statement? Let me explain with an example. You might say, \u201cI was afraid to look stupid, so I didn\u2019t ask questions.\u201d If I was in the same situation as you were, I would say \u201cI could be self-sufficient and google for an answer. Besides I don\u2019t want to take too much of other people\u2019s time asking questions because time is money.\u201d\n\nBy now, you could probably relate yourself to my situation and are looking for a silver bullet to overcome the same issue. I hate to beak it to you but I don\u2019t have a silver bullet because I can\u2019t just stop being logical. I don\u2019t want to stop being rational. I don\u2019t want to be unreasonable. But I have been doing a few things differently. I have been taking notes, seeing things from different perspectives and making conscious decisions instead of subconscious ones. When I look back at my life 5\u201310 years from now, I\u2019ll be happy if I have less of \u201cI should have done it differently\u201d and more of \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself for making that choice.\u201d"

        "text": "The facts are these: there is a significant number of app making companies out there. In fact, according to a post on Clutch.co, 67% of small businesses planned to have an app finished by the end of 2017. Keep in mind that this information includes only mobile app statistics, without desktop or web apps.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say that you want to find reliable app makers to partner with. In the sea of all the tech companies, you can easily get lost. Why? Because it can be difficult to distinguish good from the bad ones. Fortunately, there are numerous parameters that can separate good app making companies from the ones you don\u2019t want to do business with. These parameters are:\n\nDon\u2019t forget: the best app making companies are the ones that have employees who work thoroughly, efficiently and keep an eye on details. Employees in these types of companies invest their time, knowledge and skills to come up with the best possible solutions. They are able to put themselves in their users\u2019 shoes, recognize their deepest needs, and use this information as a guidance when building an app.\n\nLet\u2019s move on with the story. Imagine finding several companies that you think will be a good fit for you. Before you reach out those companies and evaluate them, though, you should understand how the app making process works.\n\nIf you are new to the whole development process, you should be aware of the fact that team commitment or great communication amongst team members are not enough to ensure the quality of an app. A team of developers and designers have to follow certain steps that will lead them to the final goal.\n\nSo, which steps are there in the development process? What makes a great development process? Does the development process depend on developers\u2019 and designers\u2019 knowledge, or is there more to it?\n\nLet\u2019s answer all of these questions (and more)!\n\nJust a quick note before I start with the actual steps\u30fcin the following text, I will cover the process that outsourcing app making companies go through, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise since I work for a company that is a remote development team.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go through all the steps.\n\nYou have probably heard that making a good first impression is the key to doing business. We definitely agree and here\u2019s why.\n\nMaking a good first impression is important, because it establishes trust in the long run and has the power to loosen up the first contact atmosphere. In fact, did you know that one sincere smile in interpersonal communication can make you more memorable?\n\nSo, what happens during this meeting?\n\nIn most cases, the best app making companies try to meet the client face-to-face. If that is not a possibility, the first contact can be established over the phone.\n\nOnce the Project Manager gathers all the information they need about the project, they introduce you to the team, who then explore your idea deeper by having a brainstorming session with the development and design team.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about app making companies\u30fcdevelopers and designers have to work together in order to create an app the way the client wanted. If they don\u2019t, the goal of creating an app won\u2019t be clear and there will always be one element left out. Everyone has to be on the same page, understanding each other\u2019s tasks, and contributing equally.\n\nWhat major decisions should a team make? Well, in this step the team should choose the right platform for the app, depending on its purpose and the ultimate goal. Understandably, there are differences between choosing a platform for a mobile or for a web app.\n\nAt the same time, a team of designers should work on making the best possible visual solution for the app. Designers create mockups of what the app should look like when it is finalized. This includes adding the logo and all the vital elements, like color, fonts, styling etc.\n\nOnce the team has a concept of the idea, the company should reach out to you and present it.\n\nOnce the idea is thoroughly explored, the team/the Project Manager will present it to you. Usually, a team of designers is in charge of this, since designers can easily lead you through every development and designer choice.\n\nIn this phase, you can spot a good development company just by paying attention to the feedback they provide you with, after you ask a question or disagree with something. Teams from the best app making companies always try to gather as much feedback as possible, because they know that is how trustworthy collaborations are established.\n\nAlso, if there is something you are not pleased with, you should always mention it and, eventually, have it changed. Keep in mind that this step is the final preparation before the actual programming starts.\n\nThe app making process requires both development and design teams working together to create the final product. Usually, the client periodically checks the team\u2019s progress and makes changes, if needed.\n\nThere are several methods which can ensure that the app development process is one the right track.\n\nYou have probably heard of agility and Scrum teams. Some managers in app making companies say that it is the best way to be in control of the project and monetize the progress. We can say that this method has led us through all of our projects and hasn\u2019t disappointed us so far.\n\nThe app making process consists of the actual coding. The goal of every project is to make sure that you end up with a high-quality code, and it can be achieved by hiring experienced developers that can deliver fast, without hurting the code quality. However, there is one approach to the development process that will definitely raise the chance of having a quality code\u30fcTDD.\n\nTDD is an acronym of three words: Test Driven Development methodology. In short, this means that developers have to test their code before they can call it finished. Tests should be done periodically and the code is not considered finished until it passes every test. When performing the tests, remember that the first test is definitely going to fail. This is one of the first rules of development.\n\nApp making companies opt for beta testing only when the app is completely finished, i.e. when both the design and the coding part have been completed.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, beta testing is highly efficient. If a development company decides to skip beta testing, it can cost more since all the testing is done once the app is already released on the market.\n\nKeep in mind that checking for bugs, performance, usability and all the other issues is a must before the official app launch. Don\u2019t let any other app making companies tell you different.\n\nIf you think that your development team is \u201coff the hook\u201d once the app is launched, think again. The project continues even after the release and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll need someone who\u2019ll have your back.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect app. Bugs can occur even after the launch, but it is important to deal with them the moment they occur. That is why the development team takes care of the app by fixing all the issues that can come along. In this phase, the team takes the role of technical support.\n\nAs you can see, the development process is just like any other process\u30fcit requires hard-working people who properly communicate and are not afraid to face challenges.\n\nBear in mind that the app making process can be a success only when both sides work together. The development team needs your input before creating an app and your information about their progress.\n\nThank you for reading the article until the very end. I hope you found it helpful!"

        "text": "We all know it\u2019s very possible to sit at a desk for 12 hours a day and accomplish nothing. I\u2019ve done it many times before \u2014 unless you count Cow Clicker Extraordinaire\u2122 as productivity.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot in the last decade about productivity vs hard work. From corporate cubicles and to the now prevalent \u201cwork anywhere, anytime\u201d modern attitude, debate rages over whether more hours spent at a desk equates to more productivity.\n\nOn the one hand we know that empirically it doesn\u2019t, for the reason that \u201cappearing to work\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cworking\u201d. On the other, we\u2019re still measured socially and professionally by how long we spend at the office.\n\nHence, we still send emails at 9pm to make it look like we\u2019re still working.\n\nIt\u2019s childish, and the reason it still exists is that it\u2019s frankly really hard to measure and track real productivity. If I spend 5 hours fixing something, that seems productive. But maybe if I spent an extra hour being careful two days ago I could have avoided this problem altogether.\n\nNobody has figured out a standardized way to empirically measure how good someone\u2019s work is given the time they took to do it. Spending an extra hour copying and pasting excel sheets will yield more sheets. But what if you spent that hour instead thinking about how to write a computer script to do it automatically? You\u2019d have fewer sheets at the end of the hour but many, many more in the future.\n\nSo we resort to the closest abstraction \u2014 how long you see someone working.\n\nThis leads to debates like these, where some will argue that brute force of more hours spent will ensure success \u2014 and others will argue that time off is required to be productive for the hours that you\u2019re actually working.\n\nTo answer the question of whether working more hours will lead to productivity, we have to first quantify productivity.\n\nWhat is productivity then? I mean really, at the end of the day? Is it the amount of work completed?\n\nThe real definition is that productivity is not measured by number of steps taken, but number of steps taken in the right direction. It\u2019s a vector with direction and magnitude.\n\nAdjusted to suit our definition, effort applied to movement in the right direction will magnify the benefits of going the right direction. Effort applied to going the wrong direction only serves to go further in the wrong direction.\n\nIf you carve out 100 hours in a week to run a million steps, but you\u2019re running away from candy mountain, you may as well have not moved. Unless of course you don\u2019t actually want to go to candy mountain. Strange folks.\n\nSo what we know then is we need the right direction, and effort to move fast in that direction.\n\nI\u2019ll take a moment at this point to say that there are a lot of people and companies out there that are currently moving very very fast \u2014 but in the wrong direction.\n\nHow can we make sure we\u2019re going the right direction?\n\nFirst off, I believe it\u2019s easier to find the right direction in some functional disciplines than others. Functional areas such as sales for example find their direction comparatively easily and so the bulk of the focus is thus correctly spent on people who can push harder, faster.\n\nProduct development however is a completely different beast. It\u2019s incredibly, incredibly hard to find the right direction, and all too often teams jump straight into running without knowing where they\u2019re running to.\n\nIt\u2019s techniques such as the Lean Startup that encourage this kind of rapid fire mentality. Since the future is unknowable, keep firing from the hip until something sticks. While there is merit in the framework\u2019s method of experimentation, the culture built around it of always hustling, always working, isn\u2019t necessarily going to cause that direction to be found sooner.\n\nIt\u2019s like throwing darts at a target in a pitch black room. From my extensive dart missing experience, it\u2019s hard enough to throw darts with the lights on, if I\u2019m any measure.\n\nSo how do we find the right direction? For starters \u2014 more thinking, less doing. Time spent thinking will hopefully at the very least give you a flashlight to use in that pitch black dart room. It wont guarantee you\u2019ll hit the target, but it\u2019ll greatly reduce the ambiguity of where you\u2019re throwing.\n\nDoing implies moving. Thinking implies looking carefully at options, weighing their projected chances of success, evaluating cost, and pinpointing where more information is needed.\n\nYou tell me which one is more likely to point you in the right direction. Before barrelling down a rabbit hole, stop, and think.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and dandy, but what exactly are we supposed to think about?\n\nIf we break thinking down further, there are two components in my opinion to what will ultimately land you in the right direction \u2014 logical reasoning and creative ideation.\n\nIf the goal is to find which path is best to take, you need logic. Break down big problems into actionable parts that you can then validate by asking people, doing more research, etc. It\u2019s about using common sense to deduce the right questions to ask that will get you the answers you need.\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how much insight a few well placed questions can give you into guiding what you should do next.\n\nThe second piece of the puzzle is creative ideation. There\u2019s productive and unproductive ways to go about this, but in general once you have a good understanding of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve (an understanding brought about by deep thinking and logic) you need to put yourself in a situation that lets ideas come.\n\nAs anyone involved with the creative process knows, creativity comes from a side of the brain that isn\u2019t very efficient when you try to use it intentionally. Aka \u2014 sitting in front of a blank canvas trying to think of what to paint isn\u2019t going to give you a Picasso.\n\nIn the same vein, lightning won\u2019t strike for you sitting in front of a computer either. You need to be stretching your experiences, shaking up routine, trying to eat with your left hand (unless you\u2019re left-handed in which case eat with your right). Ideas come when your mind is idling, daydreaming and wandering.\n\nNo great ideas were ever dreamt up by people sitting at a desk trying to think of great ideas.\n\nThen naturally the final conclusion should be that more hours spent working (if working is defined by being in an office and physically producing things) does not lead to productivity. You should, ironically, spend more time doing things other than work to be more productive with your time.\n\nThis culture of always on, always moving is not only hazardous to the important life things outside of work, but is actually brainwashing a generation of people to think that all this effort is actually going to get them what they want.\n\nIf hours worked caused success, Marissa Mayer with her 130 hour work weeks would be running the most successful company in the world. Instead, Mark Zuckerberg and others spend on average 50-60 hours at the office."

        "text": "You could make something right now. If you wanted to stop reading, grab a sheet of butcher\u2019s paper and brainstorm ideas, you could probably come up with half a dozen ideas for apps, books or products. Ideas aren\u2019t the hard part, after all \u2013 just ask Tom Haverford.\n\nYou could build a Wordpress site and start harassing your friends to test the concept. You could start writing op-ed pieces on Medium and put \u201cFounder\u201d or \u201cAuthor\u201d in your Twitter bio within 48 hours. You could throw up a landing page, post the first chapter of a book and start pushing it on Product Hunt.\n\nWhere things get tough is when you\u2019re trying to make something that people genuinely give a shit about. You don\u2019t want your dream to die in the chamber, because nobody read it, watched it, used it or listened to it. The deafening silence surrounding your work can crush your soul.\n\nYou want people to care?\n\nIf you want to make something that people really care about, that they actually give a hot shit about, you have to care about it yourself. Because if you don\u2019t, then try as you might, it\u2019ll come out in the final product.\n\nThe reason for this?\n\nMaking something is hard. Making something you don\u2019t care about is even harder.\n\nThe only way you\u2019ll be able to consistently work, when you don\u2019t want to work, consistently try when you don\u2019t want to try, is by deeply and honestly caring about your work.\n\nYou want people to care?\n\nYou have to genuinely care, yourself.\n\nThe best writing advice I have ever heard was to write specifically for someone I know. It\u2019s a genius idea. Every time I go to create something, or build something I think about who I know that would benefit from what I\u2019m doing.\n\nIf you have something that you care enough about to make, you have to ask the next question \u2013 who are you making it for? What information do they need? What turn of phrase would stop them in their tracks? What is their single pain point that the product could solve, or their secret story that your novel would be able to touch and cultivate into a real emotional response?\n\nStop thinking about your audience as a vague concept, a collection of faceless people.\n\nBelieve that your audience is a real person with feelings, experiences and a story. It will change your perspective.\n\nYou want people to care?\n\nYou have to know what will make them care.\n\nYou need to ask yourself whether you have the courage, the strength, the motivation and the passion to make what you want to make. And I mean really ask yourself, because when you first come up with an idea you can get so caught up in it that you can\u2019t see anything else.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to mistake excitement for passion, motivation and ability.\n\nWhen that feeling starts to die down, or you get used to it, you can realise that you don\u2019t have the real raw power to be able to finish and follow through. That\u2019s not a bad thing; there is nothing wrong with recognising that a project isn\u2019t right for you. Maybe there\u2019s another project that is.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough just to care about what you\u2019re making \u2013 it has to feel right.\n\nYou want people to care?\n\nOnly work on projects that feel right.\n\nHave you ever watched one of those reality TV singing competitions? You\u2019ve probably seen a hundred young people, eyes shining, clutching microphones and talking about their dreams. They\u2019ll explain that ever since they were kids, they wanted to be singers.\n\nThey hardly ever say they wanted to sing. When it comes down to it, half the time it\u2019s because actually singing isn\u2019t the end goal. They want the trappings and lifestyle and the breaks of being a singer.\n\nIf the act of singing was really their end goal, they wouldn\u2019t be on a reality TV show. They\u2019d be out there every night singing anywhere they could, writing songs, starting bands, recording music.\n\nThe same is true for anything you could make. Do you want to make X, or do you want to be the person who made X? Because if you don\u2019t care about the act of making something, and if you don\u2019t want to get out there every day and try to make something, you might as well quit.\n\nYou want people to care?\n\nThey should care about your work. Not you.\n\nIf you want to write a book that can break someone\u2019s heart \u2013 work hard.\n\nIf you want to start a business that changes the world \u2013 work hard.\n\nIf you want to draw a comic book that expresses everything you are, and dream about \u2013 work hard.\n\nYou want people to care?"

When people tell you having children will change your life, what they fail to mention is by how much.

Something that\u2019ll get you back on track much quicker.\n\nIn parenting, much like startupping, things are serious \u2014 I mean it\u2019s your baby we\u2019re talking about here. But not everything is a trainwreck. Unless it was your App that caused an actual trainwreck, in which case this article has probably run its course for you. It may not seem like a laughing matter at the time, but once the dust settles, finding the humour in what went wrong is a great way to relieve tension, build camaraderie and create a positive atmosphere to get back down to business.\n\nThere\u2019s that saying \u201cFailing to plan is planning to fail\u201d. I find this to be true in child- and product-rearing. My wife is really great at planning. Me, not so much. She packs our daughter\u2019s food bag every night, texts me the times she eats and sleeps and always makes sure there are enough nappies, wipes and a clean change of clothes in the baby bag \u2014 because, point 1. So we seldom run into unplanned scenarios, which is great for someone like me who hates surprises. The same can be said for our Flamelink Dev team. there are some really great planners on the team, and a quick look at our PM boards allows one to very quickly see where we are up to in terms of our weekly release of tweaks, features and small fixes.\n\nWhile it\u2019s great to have a plan, sometimes your plan doesn\u2019t work. Kids are the ultimate variable, changing the game at a moment\u2019s notice. I\u2019ve always been quite rigid and ever so slightly \u2018change averse\u2019. I don\u2019t like spontaneity, I don\u2019t like surprises. I used to be a Boy Scout \u2014 their motto is \u2018Be Prepared\u2019. Which is super helpful when you have a kid, and join a startup in the same year, because there are no surprises. Hahaha. Jokes. There are always surprises. In the first couple of months marketing Flamelink, we went about all the usual routes and channels (because that\u2019s all I really knew coming from a more traditional advertising background selling, amongst other things, life insurance to stay-at-home moms on Facebook). As we started understanding what our audience did and did not respond to, we tweaked and pivoted our strategy a little to help us get Flamelink in front of the correct eyeballs.\n\nEveryone has their sweet spots, the stuff they\u2019re really good at. I am not a 3AMer \u2014 I shan\u2019t make any excuses for that. But talk to me after I\u2019ve had my first two coffees in the morning and I\u2019m your guy. I will feed, bath and dress a baby, learn more about a certain technology so I can help you write a user guide and pretty much help you conquer mountains. With that said, when you\u2019re in the thick of all things parenting (and product launching), it\u2019s easy for seeds of doubt and division to creep in. My wife and I often remind one another that we\u2019re on the same team, working toward the same goal. It\u2019s vital to keep re-affirming this to your startup teammates as well with a simple, \u201cI love you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve got your back\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s do this together\u201d.\n\nFor yourself, for your partner, for your baby (the human one and your product).\n\nThe extra mile doesn\u2019t cost anything. It might be a couple extra hours at night and over weekends, but it\u2019s the extra mile that shows your teammates and partner that you care, that you\u2019ve bought into the vision and that you\u2019re ready to do whatever it takes to make things great. I\u2019m of the humble opinion that it\u2019s only once you\u2019ve gotten to the extra mile that you find loyalty, excellence, innovation, creativity and perseverance.\n\nHumanness comes with its faults. No one has got it all together, and if it looks like they do, they\u2019re either not human, or they\u2019re paying someone good money to paint a pretty picture on social media. When you become a new parent, there is shedloads of advice on what to do, what not to do, what to sometimes do and what to sometimes not do. Being hard on yourself or your teammate(s), sets unrealistic expectations on yourself and others and it\u2019s the catalyst for setting one another up for failure. I\u2019ve found that playing open cards about our expectations creates an open channel of communication and allows one to set SMART goals for the project.\n\nHaving a child, working your job, throwing yourself at your passion or starting something new can be all-consuming. Take a break to recharge your batteries. Read a book, go for a walk outside, join a class, watch a movie, go to a party, anything. Find that activity that recharges your batteries often. Even if you just tune out for an hour or so each day, you\u2019ll find that the break gives you a fresh perspective. Three times a week, I throw my 120+ kg, 1.9m tall frame around in my local CrossFit box. I find that I not only benefit from it physically, but for 60 mins or so, my mind switches off and I get rid of any excess tension, before the overwhelming sense that I\u2019m about to die kicks in, which is also pretty distracting.\n\nHaving children and working for a startup is both challenging, and exciting. I hope that the lessons I\u2019ve learnt are something you can take to heart. Whether you\u2019re working for a startup, raising a family, or both.\n\nWhat are some of the lessons you\u2019ve learnt raising children that you\u2019ve applied at your startup?"

        "title": "Exploring SpaceX, Tesla and the Enigma of Elon Musk",
        "text": "Someone asked a question about what people thought of Elon Musk. While most folks were rather positive, there were a few that said he \u2018faffed\u2019, was over-hyped and, as a darling of VCs, was doing whatever frivolous things he wanted to. Unfortunately, the derision for the excessive adulation and fawning over, that is reminiscent of how celebrities are treated, can be quite irritating. Often, it overshadows the significant impact that his companies have had over the years, something most folks tend to disregard, instead preferring the fluff.\n\nTo set the record straight, I thought I\u2019d do a quick run-down of his work across SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity. I believe these companies are radical and have the potential to change the world. For now, I will not talk about other projects: Hyperloop, Boring Company, Open.ai or Neuralink.\n\nI will try to answer:\n\nTesla is not just an electric car maker, it\u2019s a mass producing battery company. The Gigafactory-1, which is probably the world\u2019s largest manufacturing facility, produces only Li-ion batteries primarily for the proposed annual delivery of 500,000 cars. Only partially operable, the factory is still under construction and at full capacity will have an annual production capacity of 35 GWh worth of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nWhile the electric cars rid themselves of inefficient internal combustion engines in favor of utilizing a more efficient electrical distribution system, they are cleaner but still not green. Now add SolarCity to the mix and you\u2019re looking at the potential to take houses off the grid and turn personal transportation green. They have already executed a project in South Australia installing a 139 MW back-up battery system with another deal to install solar roofs and Tesla Powerwalls on 50,000 houses. Picture Tesla cars charging on solar power produced by SolarCity roof panes feeding into a Tesla battery storage system.\n\nI love the smell of clean energy in the morning!\n\nPrior to SpaceX, a majority of satellites were launched by United Launch Alliance (ULA), Arianespace and Russian rockets (operated by subsidiaries of Arianespace). Effectively, it was a duopoly with ULA also cornering most all of the US governmental satellite launch requirements while Arianespace took care of European government launches while maintaining close to a 50% market share of private launches. The starting price for a dedicated launch on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket (10 tons of payload to GTO) is around $140 million and a Soyuz (3.3 tons to GTO) would cost about $50 million \u2014 these figures are guesstimates.\n\nEnter SpaceX with the Falcon 9 (8.3 tons to GTO) priced at $62 million effectively blowing the competition out of the park. Moreover, the Falcon 9 has a frequency of launch that is much higher than any other rocket in the world. The graph below says it all. In a span of 6 years, SpaceX is the market leader (by number of launches). Moreover, evident from the graph, it\u2019s clear that other players haven\u2019t seen a major drop in launches meaning that SpaceX has also expanded the market. In 2018, SpaceX will look to at doing a total of 30 launches including Falcon Heavy missions.\n\nSatellites have changed the way we live. Read this piece by Will Marshall, CEO of Planet to understand how it has made our lives better. Try going about your week without using services that depend on GPS: Google Maps, Uber, food-ordering services etc. SpaceX has brought down the cost of launching a satellite drastically and will continue to lower the cost of access to space.\n\nSpace technology has improved the lives millions of farmers across India. Having had the privilege of spending an hour interviewing a former Chairman of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Dr. Kasturirangan, I could write a whole post about how ISRO\u2019s satellites have been aiding in meteorology, Earth observation, communication and remote sensing \u2014 directly helping farmers, fisheries, surveying etc. While India has managed to build a robust space programme that is near self-reliant, most other countries, both developed and developing, do not have the capability to launch satellites.\n\nWith SpaceX opening up access to space by lowering costs, developing countries can now launch their satellites and harness space technology for the benefit of their people. The chart below indicates that this decade has seen 31 countries launch their first satellites aboard an existing launch service provider. At least a handful of these have been from developing countries that were secondary payload aboard a Falcon 9 \u2014 Mongolia, Ghana, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan. While most of the new satellites are experimental payloads, over time, they will progress to building larger satellites designed for specific use cases. Newer players like Rocket Lab are entering the market with small satellite launchers that can perform launches at a rapid rate with high affordability. The market is only set to grow.\n\nWhen it comes to renewable energy solutions being built by Tesla, there\u2019s two things to look at. First, the technology is in a fairly early stage of commercialization. Hence the cost is quite high, but as more people adopt cleaner tech, the cost of production will decrease. Surging demand will allow for the building of more Gigafactories that produce clean-tech at unprecedented scale enabling, over time, affordable solutions for developing countries. Here\u2019s something to ponder about. When Tesla began, Elon first built a car for the rich using the cash flow to then work on a premium car which was a little more affordable and followed that up with a mass production car. Building for the poor first, sadly, isn\u2019t the easiest.\n\nSecond, the per-capita carbon footprint in developed countries is multiple times that of developing countries. Here\u2019s a sample: Per-capita carbon footprint in US (19.8 tonnes), Australia (20.6 tonnes), UK (9.7 tonnes), China (4.6 tonnes), India (1.2 tonnes), Kenya (0.3 tonnes). It makes more sense getting people in developed countries to use cleaner energy sources.\n\nNote: Figures mentioned above and in chart do not match as the chart data is from 2012. It is worth exploring the detailed data on economicshelp.com which has a list of most countries and their per capita CO2 emissions. Also, take a look at World Resources Institute\u2019s study of the global top 10 emitters."

        "title": "Writing an About Page for My Blog \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "When I restarted blogging five months ago, I didn\u2019t rewrite my about page. I didn\u2019t write a short bio for Twitter or Medium either. I wanted my readers to make their minds by reading my posts, not by the two sentences in my short bio.\n\nThe Need for an Up-To-Date About Page\n\nThe page views of the about page of my blog is only 2% of the overall traffic. This figure looks small, but that 2% could be the most important 2%. Those visitors might be the most interested ones in my blog.\n\nNot having an up-to-date about page can become a problem, because I write posts on a variety of topics.\n\nMy first time readers might get confused when they visit my blog or sign up to my email newsletter. They might expect posts on one topic, but receive posts on another. I want to clarify my position for my first time readers.\n\nWhich Topics to Expect from Me\n\nThe majority of my blog posts and page views are in the personal development category. Lately, I didn\u2019t write much about this topic. This doesn\u2019t mean that I stopped writing about this topic. Personal development is a topic that I\u2019m interested in.\n\nLately, I write mostly on blogging and marketing. It\u2019s a topic that I\u2019m trying to figure out.\n\nI document my thinking process, my plans, and my progress. Some of my readers enjoy that insider look at my journey. Some of them give me feedback and tips. All of that helps me make my mind on how to carry on toward my goals.\n\nI see blogging and marketing as a part of entrepreneurship and starting up a business. Most of my posts on entrepreneurship and startups are also on blogging and marketing.\n\nI have some posts on the inner game of entrepreneurship as well. I plan to keep writing such posts.\n\nThere are two topics that I don\u2019t plan to write anymore. Those two topics are management and investing.\n\nManagement of established businesses doesn\u2019t excite me anymore. I\u2019m more interested in starting something from scratch and turning it into an established business.\n\nI don\u2019t like to write about investing for two reasons. First, most people don\u2019t have any funds to invest. Second, my investing strategy is extremely boring. I believe in dollar cost averaging and buying and forgetting until retirement.\n\nPeople want to read about trading, technical analysis, and the latest cryptocurrencies. My posts don\u2019t satisfy the \u201cturn $100 USD to $10 million USD, buy a Lamborghini, and party with models\u201d crowd.\n\nI\u2019m a 39 years old software developer living in Genk Belgium. I\u2019m originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I completed my PhD in Informatics in 2012.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve always been in the technical side of business. My focus was on B2B software. With my blog, I dive into the commercial side of B2C. That\u2019s quite a switch and there\u2019s a lot to learn.\n\nFrom an Expert to a Novice\n\nThere\u2019s a big contrast between being an expert B2B software developer and a novice B2C marketer. That\u2019s a challenge.\n\nI always wanted to build a business in B2C marketing, especially information marketing. This goal kept my mind busy for too long. I want to stop procrastinating on this goal and do my best to achieve it.\n\nIf I succeed, that would be great. If I fail, I would let go of this goal and move on.\n\nUsing My Experience as a B2B Software Developer\n\nEven though I\u2019m a beginner B2C marketer, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a complete novice. I bring all the experience in my career to my new venture.\n\nQualities like analytical thinking and focusing on what matters help me in this challenge. I apply the scientific method and reverse engineering to my marketing goals. I developed these qualities and experience in my B2B software development career.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot is to know how to extract lessons from my experience. I spent only five months on my blog. Yet, I learned a lot about B2C and marketing. I documented those lessons in my blog.\n\nThe experience transfer isn\u2019t one way. I transfer the lessons I learned from my blogging experience to my software development job.\n\nIn blogging, I don\u2019t have time for busy work. Busy work contributes little or not at all to my end goals.\n\nAfter five months of blogging, I developed an eye for what the end user would be interested and what they wouldn\u2019t. Anything that wouldn\u2019t interest or benefit the end user, directly or indirectly, is busy work. I try to avoid that to the extent possible.\n\nAnother lesson I learned from blogging is the importance of ease of use. My blog post have to be extremely easy to read. A reader won\u2019t read long sentences, long paragraphs, or long chunks of text.\n\nAn end user won\u2019t be able to use complicated software, no matter how capable that software is. Now, I pay more attention on how usable a solution is before offering it to an end user.\n\nMy goal with my blog is to build an audience of 100K Medium followers and 20K email newsletter subscribers by July 1, 2019.\n\nThis goal requires a lot of domain specific lessons to be learned. Moreover, it also requires some personal development, productivity, leadership, motivation, and entrepreneurship lessons. I\u2019ll write on those lessons as I come up with them.\n\nAn up-to-date about page explains my readers who am I and what my blog is about. As the topics discussed in my blog get diversified, an up-to-date about page becomes more and more necessary.\n\nI will use the information in this post to update my about page. Moreover, I\u2019ll use this information to write my short bios for Medium and Twitter and the welcome email of my email newsletter.\n\nIs there any information that you would like to see in an about page that I haven\u2019t mentioned here? Let me know in the comments and I might include it in the new version."

        "text": "One of the best books I read in my 20s was also one of the shortest.\n\nIt was by a man called Paul Arden, an advertising executive at Saatchi & Saatchi in London. He was one of those people who was held in very high regard by his direct peers, but little known outside his sphere.\n\nHe probably should have had much more of a following as his ideas were valuable and relevant across a multitude of disciplines. Maybe the fact he passed away in the same year Twitter launched is symbolic \u2014 I can imagine him being a big hit there.\n\nAlthough pretty portable in terms of its application, the book is mainly aimed at advertising creative teams, and I enjoyed pulling what I could into other industries.\n\nOne of the best bits is about how creative teams tend to think about briefs.\n\nI think this very simple advice is even better 10 years later given how our attention spans have dropped, and feelings of entitlement and frustration increased.\n\nI\u2019ve found myself proffering this piece of advice a few times recently to impatient, ambitious or disgruntled peers.\n\nWe get fed up with the briefs that cross our desk.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable. They\u2019re often dull, or badly written; lacking incisiveness, or too safe.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say we shouldn\u2019t send back bad briefs to their author. But that\u2019s another story.\n\nThe point is it\u2019s about focusing on what\u2019s in front of you right now, and like a lot of the best writing this simple little nugget from Mr Arden has a lot packed into it:\n\nYou may surprise yourself (and others) at what you can do with what\u2019s right in front of you;\n\nThe odds are that you won\u2019t ever get a shot at your dream brief without doing this one first;\n\nThe glamour fixtures nearly always come with a catch so be careful what you wish for;\n\nAnd you never know who\u2019s watching.\n\nPerhaps that brief on your desk right now is perfect. You just don\u2019t know it yet."

        "text": "Life is a constant game of playing hide and seek with the truth.\n\nIt\u2019s just too difficult to live in a completely honest world; the world without rationalizations, white lies, and half-truths. We can\u2019t live in that world because it would be too painful. No one would get along with each other andmost wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with their own lives.\n\nToday I want to talk about the lies we tell ourselves.\n\nIn my book, I refer to the \u201cmask of rationalization\u201d that blinds us to a better future. It blinds us to a better future because a better future requires discomfort. Regardless of your definition of success, it won\u2019t happen for you until you\u2019re honest with yourself. You\u2019ll never be honest with yourself one hundred percent of the time because it\u2019s too painful. But if you find enoughglimpses of honesty to act, you\u2019ll move closer to whatever it is you\u2019re looking for.\n\nPeople who \u201cmake it\u201d have that tough dialogue in their minds, expose the rationalizations, lies, and half-truths they tell to themselves.\n\nLike I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t know what a better future means for you, but if you\u2019re feeling stuck right now, my best bet is that you\u2019re avoiding the truth in some shape or form. You haven\u2019t examined your life and had that tough conversation. You haven\u2019t stood squarely at the fork in the road. Instead, you\u2019re pretending like it\u2019s not there.\n\nHere are some of the common lies we tell ourselves to feel better in the present while at the same time sacrificing our futures.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe you already have everything you need to be happy. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking the next accomplishment or milestone will make you feel better. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nI thought when I wrote my first book I\u2019d be content forever because I finally crossed it off my bucket list. The euphoria lasted a solid hour. Then, I started worrying about how many copies it\u2019d sell. The more I succeed the less full I feel, which is why I constantly remind myself that who I am right now and what I do in this moment is all I can hold onto.\n\nWhen I create from a source of joy instead of neediness, my work does well. Each and every single time I push to make my work \u201cpopular\u201d it fails. When I remember I write because I love to write, I just write. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens after that, as long as I put the words on the page for the day.\n\nSuccess comes as a bi-product of being content and doing what you enjoy. It almost never happens the other way around. It\u2019s one of the great paradoxes of life.\n\nWhen it comes to your life, you\u2019re probably thinking it needs to be fixed. You think something outside of you needs to happen to make you feel a certain way. Even if it does happen that way, the change still happened inside of you.\n\nI wrote the book about changing from the inside out. Sure, there are sections about actions you can take, but for the most part, change happens when you change the way you view yourself and what you need to be happy, which is nothing\u2026but your own permission.\n\nWhen you question why you deserve something, sometimes it\u2019s hard to come up with great answers.\n\nYou think you deserve success and wealth \u2014 why? What have you done to warrant either? How long have you worked for them? Have you worked for them?\n\nYou think you deserve great relationships \u2014 why? How well are you treating people? How much have you been working on yourself as opposed to wishing people fit into your definition of a good person?\n\nWe\u2019re all self-centered. We want success, happiness, money, freedom, love, great health \u2014 we want it all. Wanting these things isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s inescapable. But thinking they\u2019re owed to you causes misery when you don\u2019t get them.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t expect to make returns in the stock market without investing first, right?\n\nWhy would you expect a great return on your desires without a significant investment? Because you\u2019re a human being \u2014 imperfect, hopeful, and forever flawed.\n\nI\u2019ve stopped trying to fight my humanness and my flaws. Instead, I try to be more aware of them.\n\nWhen the success I want doesn\u2019t happen when I want it to, I ask myself.\n\n\u201cHave I done all I can?\u201d \u201cDid I take shortcuts?\u201d \u201cShould I be patient and let things develop?\u201d\n\nThis awareness centers me and calms me down \u2014 for about 5 seconds, a minute, an hour, or a day \u2014 then it\u2019s back into the anxiety loop.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not trying to cure myself. I\u2019m trying to understand myself.\n\nIf you want to increase your awareness, think about whether or not you trulydeserve what you think is owed to you.\n\nYesterday a woman reached out to me. She told me she wondered if changing was still possible in her life at the age of 49.\n\nWhen you live a certain way for a long period of time, you have a mountain of evidence against your case for change.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve been told over and over again in subtle ways that there\u2019s a ceiling to what you\u2019re capable of, it\u2019s hard to believe you can do more.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to you or where you\u2019re headed.\n\nBut I do know this.\n\nYour past doesn\u2019t have to dictate your future.\n\nI spent the first five years of my 20\u2019s getting in trouble and massively underachieving. I\u2019ve spent the last three years living out my dream of becoming a writer, finding stability and sanity, and working harder than I\u2019ve ever thought was possible for me.\n\nThe rock bottom moment is very real. I\u2019ve had many of them. You can get fed up with living a certain way and change.\n\nYou can do something about your situation.\n\nIn fact, one of you will.\n\nIf one percent of people are truly \u2018successful\u2019 odds are at least one person who reads this is going to decide, \u201cyou know what, I\u2019m ready. I can\u2019t live like this anymore.\u201d\n\nIs it you?"

        "text": "A Guide To Upping Your Nonverbal Game + Pitching With More Power\n\nLet\u2019s assume your startup is on-point and your homework on paper is done.\n\nWhat\u2019s left, which is 93% of the game, is your mission to bring that paper to life.\n\n93% of communication is nonverbal, which is more awesome than it sounds. It means we have a giant arsenal of tools at our disposal, all of which are far easier to employ and more interesting to behold than the necessary (but less engaging) facts and figures of our projects.\n\nSo before your next pitch, it\u2019s worth your while to become more intentional about what you are broadcasting on your nonverbal channels.\n\nKeep your slides simple. Your physical presence is far more memorable than a fact-filled slide. Your audience will be choosing between looking at you and looking at the slides throughout your presentation, so make it an easy choice. Investors know they can study the in-depth data later \u2014 the pitch is an opportunity to win them over with your unique presence, framed by simple, striking visuals. The 93% rule applies to your deck, too \u2014 the non-verbal elements of your slides, like color choices and evocative imagery, are going to be speaking far louder than their words.\n\nMinimize your accent. Far too many pitches fall flat because the otherwise-brilliant entrepreneurs are just a few adjustments away from being easily understood by their English-speaking audience. Consider enlisting a native-English-speaking friend to help you nail the vowel sounds in your pitch."

        "title": "Why Writing Code and Working Out Aren\u2019t So Different",
        "text": "Why Writing Code and Working Out Aren\u2019t So Different\n\nIn many ways, I don\u2019t think that writing code and working out are very different. For both, you have to undertake a journey of gaining knowledge and utilizing it in practice. This must be done on a regular basis, lest you get rusty. You have certain people who really take it all very seriously and become superstars, and others who just cruise by, only doing the bare minimum, and even worse \u2014 those who do nothing at all. Both branches of knowledge require good and strong habits to be in place, both will help you in many parts of life that initially don\u2019t even seem related, and both are intimidating to those who are inexperienced.\n\nAs with any skill, you need to practice, practice, and practice. You need to continuously challenge yourself, continuously put yourself in a learning process, and above all \u2014 make learning the skill a habit. Even doing something at half effort on a regular basis is better than doing it full effort but only once in a while.\n\nWith both fitness and learning programming, it has to be part of your weekly, or even daily routine. Both skills permeate their effects throughout the rest of your life \u2014 whether its an overall shift in your approach to health as with fitness, or a different way of looking at projects, solving problems, and perhaps even your employment situation as with programming.\n\nI\u2019ve written about the importance of being aware of your habits and working to mindfully ingrain good ones into your life. Working out and writing code are just habits in the beginning.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see examples of those who are killing it in their field at a young age. You naturally compare yourself to them, thinking how you barely had anything together at that point in time. Thoughts like this can easily lead to the idea that you\u2019re too old (or too far along a different path) to start something new and something that, especially in the beginning, seems very complicated and taxing. In reality, and as countless examples show, such is not the case. Whether you begin with half mile runs or just learning the introductory aspects of web development, it\u2019s easy to begin, especially with the wealth of free information readily available.\n\nWith both working out and writing code, you always need to be operating at the peak of your skills to make good and timely progress. If you stay with the easy path, you don\u2019t grow. You need to always find a new challenge and find ways to refine and improve your current skillset by looking for the difficult opportunities. Momentum is vital here.\n\nTime ticks on, and there\u2019s the saying that is along the lines of \u201cthe best time to start is two years ago, but the second best time is now.\u201d You can find yourself in a year with a vastly improved skillset in and seeing the benefits of working out and programming, or you can find yourself in the same state that you are now. The way that you use the interim time is vital \u2014 same goes for learning and progressing at anything.\n\nSoftware is continuously improved as time goes on and it\u2019s constantly worked on with small, medium, and large goals in mind. One\u2019s level of skill development follows the same process. As you learn more about programming, how to approach different problems, what languages and frameworks to use for various applications, and so on, you\u2019ll become more and more confident and able. As you run more, lift more, work on your form, eat well, and so on, you\u2019ll become similarly more confident and able.\n\nGet started. Make sure you have specific goals to focus on, rather than a nebulous idea of where you want to be \u2014 this is of the utmost importance. Break down how long you want to give yourself for those goals, and break it down even further into milestones that you believe are attainable at regular intervals of time (for example, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months). The first step is the most difficult, but once you build momentum, you\u2019ll reap the benefits. Good luck."

        "text": "If You Say You \u201cWork Hard, Play Hard\u201d \u2014 You Probably Do Neither\n\nParticularly in self-employed and (early-stage) startup circles, there\u2019s a huge amount of people who say that they \u201cwork hard, play hard.\u201d In general, I\u2019ve seen that the vast majority of those who say this actually do neither.\n\nTypically, the \u201cplay hard\u201d aspect refers to going out (oftentimes in the form of partying) as much as humanly possible (which is going to be a lot, when you\u2019re your own boss and have little strict scheduling and only your own discipline as your boss). Late nights and sleeping in often result \u2014 just how the body tends to deal with it. Consequently, it\u2019s very difficult to \u201cwork hard\u201d when you are constantly hungover and hardly sleeping.\n\nThere are countless examples of booze-fueled \u201cnetworking events\u201d, beers on tap at every co-working space, or video games and ping pong at the offices of seemingly every startup in the world. The startup culture encourages this all to a great degree.\n\nProponents of the lifestyle tend to state the networking benefits occurring, which is somewhat of a legitimate excuse. However, I think that more often than not, there is very little networking occurring, and that which does occur is typically through friends and acquaintances that you can make the connection through regardless of situation.\n\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve always worked best when I\u2019m in a good groove. By this, I mean that I\u2019m in a day-to-day and week-to-week consistent cycle of productivity and keeping good habits. When that\u2019s messed up with long nights or leaving the office early for drinks or constant dinners \u2014 it\u2019s hard to keep on track. Momentum tends to suffer.\n\nThere are a lot of people who are (or look) successful and they seem to spend excessive amounts of time mostly in social situations. However, these tend to be people who are very rare in that they are able to actually embody this mentality and still succeed. It hugely varies from person to person, and comparing yourself to others is not a way to succeed. Otherwise, the people who seem to successfully embody this mentality are oftentimes already wealthy and have much more flexibility with time, or have put in their hours and spent years absent from the scene and have built their success and are now basking in it. Many times, it\u2019s the latter.\n\nThe issue is that oftentimes, many of the above examples are very visible. Particularly if they are successful, you can easily find on social media the highlight reel of their life \u2014 which can be lots of parties and travel. This does not confirm causality between playing hard and being successful, and is dangerous for those who think it does. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too, and seeing things like that will cater to your confirmation bias, or believing what you want to believe.\n\nWhen you\u2019re self-employed in any way or starting a company, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to have much, much more work than you can reasonably handle every day. You don\u2019t ever really \u201cfinish up work\u201d or \u201cclock out\u201d and have free time to spend on yourself. Without a doubt, this is a huge downside of the lifestyle, but it comes with the territory, and you must acknowledge this if you haven\u2019t already. The idea here is that the rewards are worth the multi-year slog that you must endure. If you focus hard, and prioritize, that slog can be shortened little by little. If you don\u2019t, then someone else will win out.\n\nThat being said, you also shouldn\u2019t be working at all times \u2014 it\u2019s simply not healthy either. Everyone has their own work ethic and habits that are developed over a lifetime, and no one is constantly productive at 100% capacity. Breaks, whether a 15 minute break after writing some code or a weeklong vacation somewhere, are vital for performing optimally without burning out. Go ahead and be out with friends, take trips, socialize, and do what you want to do. In the end, if you\u2019re in this lifestyle, you chose it. If your choices result in a happy balance \u2014 great. If you find that your work ethic goes down the drain without proper structure \u2014 then you\u2019re responsible for the consequences and for making improvements.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to priorities. If you genuinely prioritize non-working time a lot, or you truly believe that you\u2019re of the rare breed that is a superhuman that needs no sleep, then all the more power to you. People like that exist. But for the majority of people, work must come before play."

Every so often I have a day where after meeting a few different people, by sunset several of the topics and ideas we\u2019ve discussed seem to connect and interweave as if by magic.\n\nThis could just be coincidence or my biases at work, but I believe it\u2019s something more than that \u2014 something closer to the adjacent possible.\n\nI had one of these days a few weeks ago.\n\nAfter a sneaky late afternoon cocktail with the founder of a new marketing consultancy, I went to a bar around the block to meet a chap who works in a well known media company.\n\nAlongside weddings, craft beer and other typical lines of conversation for men in their 30s, we talked about startup life vs that of a big corporation.\n\nHe had worked in bigger companies before and felt he now preferred life at a relatively small organisation. Meanwhile his wife worked at one of the biggest tech companies in the world and absolutely loved it.\n\nHe said the reason for this was simple: she was able to handle the big company exoskeleton.\n\nAn image from Aliens immediately popped into my mind. You may remember Ripley\u2019s ability with the power loader exoskeleton; first to surprise a couple of sceptical marines, and then to dispose of a Xenomorph through the airlock.\n\nThe power loader is an intimidating bit of kit. It looks like it needs its pilot to have serious physical strength and brawn. This may be somewhat useful, but what\u2019s more important is dexterity, patience, and rhythm.\n\nWhen used effectively, it can handle enormous pressure, apply huge leverage, make big efficiencies and deflect all but the most damaging blows.\n\nUse it carelessly, and it\u2019s a blundering, flailing hulk with no agility and in desperate need of a makeover.\n\nIronically, one of the biggest problems large companies have is actually the dismissive marines. They\u2019re skilled and to be respected, but sometimes they can be egotistical, elitist, focused on the pay check ahead of the mission, and at risk of being seriously caught out in a rapidly changing world.\n\nSo if you want to succeed in a big organisation, it may help to think more like Ripley.\n\nAnd why the synchronicity that day?\n\nMy Tuesday cocktail was with the founder of a female-run consultancy called Ripley, named after\u2026well, who else?"

        "text": "I want to propose a new way to think about the physical possessions we own. Changing how we think about our things is a critical part of thinking forward into the digital future we are heading toward. We are creating a cryptocurrency marketplace in order to help the adoption, and forward progression of blockchain technology and use.\n\nJunktion.io is creating a viable eCommerce solution on the blockchain. A marketplace where people can buy and sell their physical goods in exchange for cryptocurrency.\n\nEveryone has an item they have that they no longer use, or use something like once or twice a year.\n\nGreat, but do you need to own it? What about putting it on the blockchain as a unique piece of property. You can allow other people to buy this piece of property as well, you can contribute, and share in a part of the Junktion ecosystem. Our ecosystem is a circular economy that rewards you for buying and selling items on the blockchain.\n\nIn this new school of thought, it is very much possible to profit off of buying back your items. Because your items lose value, and most cryptocurrency is designed to inflate in price. There will come a point in most items lifetimes where it would make financial sense to keep things on the blockchain.\n\nWe are creating a viable, fun and unique shopping experience on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe advantage to selling on the Junktion cryptocurrency marketplace is that you receive the cryptocurrency of your choice without any fees associated with it. Traditionally when you sell an item online and wish to obtain a cryptocurrency the money you would get from the sale of the item would exchange hands up to 3 times, all of which will have fees associated with it.\n\nDon\u2019t worry there is more.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t choose any of the ebay marketing ideas then you are left with a laughable 17% fees. It gets worse.\n\nTo see more about the fees associated with buying and selling a cryptocurrency click here.\n\nLet\u2019s say someone has a ton of old media players, like an old ipod and they are looking for one of two things. They can be looking for a way to obtain cryptocurrency without spending money. Or they can be looking to buy something else. What if this user wants to redo his wood floors as well and is looking to trade his old ipods for items that he needs for his flooring job.\n\nIf a person has a one time use for an item and they do not want the item anymore they can always recycle it back into the Junktion marketplace. Effectively by buying an item and reselling it back into the circular economy. Imagine selling an item you almost never use and buying it back at a profit the next time you want to use it.\n\nJunktion has a unique value proposition as a cryptocurrency marketplace. We are offering a liquid amount tied to your physical good. So unlocking the value in a collection of something you have can be easily done. Holding the value of the collection in cryptocurrency will allow you to in theory purchase the items back at a profit.\n\nItems decline in price. Almost all of them, The moment you drive a car off the lot it is worth less than what you paid for it. Junktion is a way to have our users profit and hopefully be able to buy back the items they put into our cryptocurrency marketplace. Due to the natural fact the items decline in price, while cryptocurrency increases.\n\nIn this school of thought, there is a way that allows you to transform your physical items into digital assets. A cryptocurrency marketplace that instantly allows users to receive an offer for any physical item you own and converting it into the cryptocurrency of your choice. Junktion takes care of everything. Start to finish.\n\nJunktion is a dapp that will have a familiar look and feel that other dapps have but be dedicated to selling physical goods. Junktion serves multiple purposes to contribute to the circular economy and cryptocurrency market place we are creating. As of now Junktion will help with the following:\n\nJunktion allows users to quickly and easily turn items into cryptocurrency. The Junktion ecosystem rewards users for buying and selling and pays in scraps every time a user contributes toward the circular economy.\n\nI summed it up pretty well in this reddit post.\n\nTo sum up a long story, I began reselling items online many years ago. I was a prolific eBay and Amazon seller. I always thought there had to be a better way. When I stumbled across dApps I instantly knew that I could create that better, more fair and eco friendly solution on the blockchain.\n\nI realized that all I wanted to do was turn my stuff into cryptocurrency. So I began creating that service myself. Currently, we will buy anything you own for cryptocurrency ourselves if you fill out this form. Sell to us\n\nI want to create alternative methods for people to earn, and adopt cryptocurrency and I think that boils down to showing people new and exciting.\n\nJunktion gives people liquidity to their items, and once we purchase the item from you it will be put for sale on our website and sold for scraps. (To learn more about our erc20 token you can see this article)\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to Junktion in any way please email us: info@junktion.io\n\nI would love to collaborate with anyone with a passion in the space.\n\nWe plan to create the new standard of selling physical items through the blockchain, both circular economy and cryptocurrency marketplace. A place where people can buy and sell items for cryptocurrency.\n\nWe are creating the best eCommerce experience in the blockchain industry on the Ethereum Network.\n\nWe want to create a seamless, one-click instant transaction that the ETH network provides and create a seamless e-commerce solution using the Ethereum network on our cryptocurrency marketplace.\n\nWe are looking for developers, marketers, and people who want to be a part of this incredible new process of buying and selling in the digital age.

        "text": "Want Better Ideas? Cherish Your Routine.\n\nThis past week, I broke my streak. It was the first time since the start of 2018 that I wasn\u2019t at least one article ahead on this blog. Up until now, that\u2019d been a great little habit \u2014 without the pressure of having to publish right now, I\u2019ve had the space to think more deeply about my topics, take more time writing each article, and frankly, produce better work.\n\nSo what happened? Why did I finally fall behind? Why am I writing this article just a few days before I need to send it to you? It\u2019s not because I couldn\u2019t find the time to write. It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t want to work on the blog. It\u2019s because I couldn\u2019t come up with a good idea. I\u2019ve been feeling a bit like Austin Kleon:\n\nMost of the ideas that turn into articles are borne from my weekly reading regimen \u2014 15 or so online sources plus whatever book is on my nightstand. I\u2019ll transcribe passages that stand out, and the best ones ultimately end up in my \u201cblog idea\u201d file. As I keep reading and learning, new thoughts are added while others glom on to existing ideas. Eventually, like a rain cloud, an idea will \u201cburst\u201d \u2014 all the assembled bits and bobs turn into a full-on article.\n\nBut lately, nothing\u2019s been bursting. This line, from the novel Authority, accurately sums up my situation:\n\nEvery day, new information comes in, but nothing\u2019s \u201cheavy\u201d enough to come back out. And so, I keep on reading.\n\nAs I got into writing this article, I realized why I\u2019ve been struggling lately. It\u2019s because last week, a family matter knocked me out of my daily routine. Much of the week, I was away from my computer. A backlog built up. Of course, I don\u2019t regret taking time off \u2014 not hardly \u2014 but I bet that it was a major factor in why I didn\u2019t have an article ready to go this week.\n\nI take this pattern as proof that my reading regimen isn\u2019t just for fun. It isn\u2019t a poor use of time or a distraction. It\u2019s a vital part of my creative process and production function. It might not always feellike work to binge-read, but it is working.\n\nNow that I\u2019m back at my desk and diving into everything I missed last week, new clouds are forming. It can\u2019t be long before they burst.\n\nIf you liked this week\u2019s article, you\u2019ll love my newsletter. Each week, I share a new article full of the creative ideas, mindsets, and habits you\u2019ll need to bring your ideas to life. Sign up. You\u2019ll like it."

However, the fog in what we don\u2019t know about ourselves is never taken into caution for what we apply ourselves in and how we should go about doing it in a way that most benefits us.\n\nKnowing thyself is how much applied introspection to our personalities has been taken and if we can witness our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe world is constantly changing around us and in a phrase that can still apply in a completely different world, this is proof that introspection will remain as important now as it was then.\n\nConsider a time when you wanted to do something outside of your limits and were ignorant to learn the methods of whatever it might be.\n\nThere is no penalty in doing what you have no experience in. But to give meaning in the effort of doing so is to know thyself well enough to see an advantage in gaining the experience.\n\nOur courage is constantly tested and our motivation ever struggling.\n\nKnowing how we operate and how obstacles pass us by is to know thyself and allow ourselves to grow in areas we cannot and will not immediately succeed.\n\nThis brings me to my next point which is if we are able to be as introspective as we see fit."

        "text": "[Prefer video form? You can find the video essay at the end of this post.]\n\nGoing online today it\u2019s like walking through a busy tourist street. To reach your goal, you have to resist all the offers, avoid random people and keep moving before someone tries to scam you.\n\nMy point is that the online world is a saturated place. Everyone is in it and everyone has something important to say.\n\nI think this freedom turned money into a secondary currency. Instead, everyone is looking for one thing: attention.\n\nLike Darwinian evolution, the internet naturally evolved to maximize attention seeking behaviors. And at the top of the attention chain, we have social media networks.\n\nWith the help of smartphones, social media apps are part of our daily lives. As of 2017, there are 2.79 billions active social media users with Facebook taking the lead with 2.01 billion monthly active users. [1]\n\nThese numbers will just keep increasing and as expected, people are wondering how social media is impacting our lives. The truth is that these technologies enable us to be all connected but it\u2019s also exposing us to a lot of risks.\n\nThere are numerous studies connection social media use with causes of depression, anxiety and other emotional consequences. Companies like Facebook collect and sell our personal data in such a way that governments are starting to increase the rights we have over our own personal information.\n\nThere are a lot of problems with this companies and platforms\u2026\n\nYet, I want to focus on something a bit more personal, how social media is affecting my ability to be productive.\n\nI grew up online and as expected, I developed some pretty unproductive habits around platforms like YouTube and Facebook.\n\nWhen I am around technology (like now) is when I am the most vulnerable. I can see my phone in the corner of my eye, silently whispering for my attention.\n\nI guess you can call this procrastinating but I think it\u2019s more like a bad habit or addiction.\n\nAs I seat down to work on an important task, like writing or researching a topic, my mind starts wandering off and I check my phone.\n\nI go back to work but now I need to check something online.\n\nAnd 20 minutes later I\u2019m on YouTube watching some random celebrity interview.\n\nAt the end of the day I feel tired, not because I accomplished much but because this back and forth between distraction and work drain my willpower.\n\nThe worst part of this cycle is losing control over how I spend my time. This impulse to go online is completely unconscious, which makes is quite difficult to avoid.\n\n#millennialproblems. Problems that need to be fix ASAP.\n\nIt sounds like there is not much going in favor of social media right? Emotional issues, time wasters, privacy issues. There\u2019s an increasing number of people criticizing social media and how technology is actively designing our opinions and hacking our attention.\n\nYet, despite all these negatives, I still think that social media is pretty awesome.\n\nAs a content creator, it allows me to share my content with people who enjoy it and need it. My podcast is the perfect example of the benefits of social media.\n\nSo far I had 7 guests on the show and all of them I discovered and first connection via social media apps.\n\nYes, most interactions I have online are superficial and probably artificial but once in a while, real people get to find my content and connect with me. Honestly, it is the best tool to find new creators and learn from them.\n\nThese tools are designed to grab our attention and makes us spend as much time as possible using them. And to be honest, I want the same from you.\n\nIf you spend a whole day watching and reading all my content, I would be extremely happy. Yet, if you are procrastinating by consuming my content, it\u2019s not my fault.\n\nYou are responsible for your time.\n\nGiants like Facebook or YouTube have a team of engineers constantly trying to hack your attention, to turn your time into profit but at the end of the day, we are still in control. Like our emotions, we have to take responsibility over our ability to choose how we spend our time.\n\nAnd this may sound quite ironic but in a blog post published by Facebook entitled Hard Questions: Is spending time on social media bad for us [2], they mentioned the following:\n\nLooking at the problem of social media purely from a productivity issue, if we all quit social media but instead spend time in from of the TV, what\u2019s the point?\n\nTherefore I think it\u2019s more productive to look at what we can do to gain control over our time, regardless of the technology trying to hack our attention.\n\nYou need to become aware of these breaks in concentration. I design a simple sheet to track how often I get the impulse to go online while I work. You can download it here.\n\nPlace it next to you while you work and every time you get the urge to go on social media, note it down. This urge will sometimes win over you so as soon as you catch yourself distracted, stop, note it down and return to work.\n\nThis exercise will train you to detect these moments of weakness and soon enough you will be able to stop yourself.\n\nThis works like a second layer of protection and you should enable it both on your computer and phone. If you cannot stop yourself from going on social media, you will be greeted with a polite reminder to go back to work.\n\nIf you need to research something online, create a list of search terms and when you return online, research everything in bulk. Because you have a clear reason to go online, you are less likely to get distracted and wander off into the distance.\n\nRemember that once you go online, every major website is optimized to grab your attention by the face.\n\nAvoid the feeds, turn off auto play features (like on YouTube) and remember how precious your attention is for your ability to be successful.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into these tactics, I compiled some tools and simple hacks you can implement to create an extra layer of protection.

        "text": "How to Build an Audience of Raving Lunatic Fans How to get the word out to the people who actually care\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, one of the most frequent topics of discussion among startups, entrepreneurs, and freelancers is this: How do I get my message/product/service in front of the people who need it?\n\nThe proof is only a quick Google away: Here\u2019s one article that details numerous secrets to get your clients/customers interested. Here\u2019s another. And another. Here\u2019s an entire online school devoted to it. Each, in their own way, geared toward helping you, the entrepreneur or founder, attract, and keep your customers. Each of these resources is also, in its own way, valuable and helpful. I encourage you to read them.\n\nBut each one is also missing something, a fundamental first step, if you will. The first step to building your audience is to have a truly amazing offer. (please note: this is not an offer that you consider amazing, but one that your clients/customers consider amazing. Remember, value looks different to everybody.)\n\nI can\u2019t count the number of would-be entrepreneurs and freelancers out there that I\u2019ve seen constantly spamming social media with their \u201camazing offers\u201d for absolutely crap products/services. I\u2019m not talking about pyramid schemes, or obvious hucksters, or the get-rich-quick crowd. They\u2019re bad, too. I\u2019m talking about genuine, sincere people who want to grow their business, but have taken too much bad advice, and as a result, have changed or watered down their product or service to the point of worthlessness.\n\nWhy is this? What has happened during the lifespan of this product to cause this? Well, let me explain.\n\nIn the Internet age, we seem to have gotten things a bit backwards in terms of our marketing and audience-attraction methods. Thanks to the ease of advertising on social media (anybody with $20 and a Facebook account can now become a \u201cFacebook ads expert\u201d through trial and error!), we think that creating an audience is the hard part of being an entrepreneur. It\u2019s not. Never has been, and never will be. The hard part of being an entrepreneur has always, and will always, be delivering an amazing product or service. The sooner we admit that, and get back to basics, the sooner we will achieve the success we want and deserve.\n\nThus, the first step to building a fanatically loyal customer base is to have a product that\u2019s worth getting fanatical about. If you\u2019re not there yet, that\u2019s 100% OK (welcome to being an entrepreneur\u2026trial and error is the name of the game!), but you\u2019re not ready to read the rest of this article yet. Take some time, and make your product or service absolutely amazing. Don\u2019t waste another minute reading this article!"

        "title": "Managing the Health of Your Technology Infrastructure",
        "text": "Your workplace technology is only as reliable as the systems in place to keep it running and healthy. Just as the systems in a human body require maintenance and upkeep to run properly, the technological infrastructure in your office runs better with the right regimen of processes and procedures. It\u2019s not uncommon to find clients who have previously invested in robust systems have run into trouble when those systems aren\u2019t given the dedicated upkeep they need. In order to keep your infrastructure healthy, we\u2019ve listed some best practices to keep your tech out of the IT infirmary.\n\nIn a complex system, multiple moving parts can make prioritization difficult; that difficulty can evolve from tricky to outright overwhelming when there\u2019s an imminent threat or breakdown. Avoid confusion and focus your strategy by setting clear goals and priorities for the crucial components of your system and resource deployment. Prioritize problems in terms of their relative impact on workflows and revenue-generating activities \u2014 while it\u2019s true that all problems are worth addressing, spending hours on an internal hiccup that has a negligible external impact while ignoring broken key functionality that your customers rely on, for example, is missing the forest for the trees. Empower your team with understanding; by laying out a clear priority list and setting goals for resolution and downtime, resources can be honed with greater precision and distributed where they\u2019re needed the most.\n\nAnticipating downtime and other issues isn\u2019t always possible, but maintaining a healthy infrastructure means shifting toward a proactive, holistic and active approach rather than reacting to disasters when they happen. If we think of computing infrastructure as human vital systems, it\u2019s the difference between regular checkups and preventive care versus waiting until you have to go to the emergency room. System maintenance and patching should be performed routinely, and active monitoring can identify problems in the earliest stages before they affect users. For example, Align\u2019s team of trained NOC engineers will find and identify a customer\u2019s issues before they impact systems and infrastructure health, and can put remediation plans in place or govern a client-owned process for remediation. Taking a more active and involved approach to IT maintenance minimizes the impact of threats when they do occur, while vigilance and patching can often thwart major disasters before they even reach your system.\n\nThe methods and tools powering your resources are as crucial as your procedures; even the most robust and optimized processes can grind to a halt when your tools and people can\u2019t sync well together or can\u2019t respond quickly. Often \u2014 especially when resources have been built reactively \u2014 disparate tools can become a patchwork of incompatibility and conversion that inevitably slows things down. When slow response time risks massive downtime and financial losses, time is precious. Setting up a configuration management database \u2014 or CMDB \u2014 provides a centrally-accessible hub that can provide a crucial tool for managing and changing live infrastructure.\n\nAnother important tool is automation. Whenever possible and safe to do so, automate regularly-occurring, essential tasks to reduce staff workloads and reallocate employee resources to the more granular or difficult tasks. It can be tempting to look busy by devoting people to tasks like these, but this can ultimately leave your organization shorthanded at crucial moments. Workflow automation continues to grow more sophisticated and intelligent through AI and cloud computing, so every opportunity to offload busywork is an opportunity to bolster your resources during more critical moments.\n\nFrom small routine patching and maintenance to nimble disaster response, maintaining the health of your technology infrastructure is a complex task. Unfortunately, some threats will be impossible to foresee, but with the right preparation and preventive care, your infrastructure will be robust and ready to handle the most serious of threats, minimizing or outright thwarting potential disasters that could leave less-prepared companies utterly helpless. Tech health, as with physical health, is a matter of prevention. Vigilance will keep your infrastructure \u2014 and your company \u2014 thriving for years to come.\n\nIs your infrastructure overdue for a checkup?

        "text": "What is the point of education?\n\nDoes it turn us into well-rounded, contributing members of society? Does it prepare us for a career in the future?\n\nCollege didn\u2019t prepare me for any of these things.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my first year after college when I enrolled in the school of hard knocks by starting a freelance career that I began to actually prepare for the future.\n\nThis self-guided education included time for self-exploration, real world application, and the real-time learning of specific skills when I needed them.\n\nI learned more during this pivotal year than my entire college career thanks to one reason:\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a simple goal for humans and living creatures alike. Everything I learned was tied to my basic need for survival. Each new lesson or skill I picked up along the pushed me further along, little by little.\n\nThanks to this deeply motivating fact, I had a reason to approach my self-guided education with extreme intentionality and laser focus.\n\nWhen starting a freelance career, time is of the utmost importance. Every minute wasted is a minute you could be devoting to insuring a more stable path for yourself in the future.\n\nLooking back at the beginning of my freelance career, I can\u2019t help but notice a few invaluable pieces that made a clear educational puzzle:\n\nOne could argue the above points are also found in traditional education. I would have to agree. As present as these items may be, there is one crucial thing missing during many college careers:\n\nHow many college students are mature enough to prioritize developing discipline over getting drunk or flirting with other coeds?\n\nWithout knowing the application of a concept, it\u2019s nearly impossible to internalize it for future use. This is exactly why learning on the job as a freelancer is much more effective than sitting in a lecture hall among an endless sea of students.\n\nWhile building your own career, you learn how to lessen the gap between concept and application with each passing day. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be employed long enough for it to matter.\n\nA freelance education may seem too intimidating for some who are looking for more stability in their lives. I challenge these students to take a harder look at traditional career prospects.\n\nHardworking people are fired every day simply because executives feel pressure from shareholders to increase profit margins, which is usually accomplished by cutting \u201cunnecessary\u201d costs while looking over spreadsheets."

        "text": "In physics, there is a concept of observer\u2019s paradox which refers to a situation in which the phenomenon being observed is unwittingly influenced by the presence of the observer/investigator. Now, let\u2019s sprinkle in some quantum mechanics to make things spicier. The double-split experiment further proved the wave-particle duality and ignited many interpretations including the many-worlds interpretation which asserts all possible alternative histories and futures are possible and so are many universes \u2014 one in which I am the JK Rowling and also one in which you grew up to be Harry Potter.\n\nComing back to this universe, when you craned your neck to look up at that clear night sky and saw a gazillion stars above you, recall that feeling of beauty and wonder.\n\nNow remove yourself from the equation.\n\nAll these amazing galaxies and stars, black holes and supernova, would continue to spin aimlessly in space, were it not for us to be wondrous at them in the first place.\n\nWe look for \u2018purpose\u2019 like a 5-year-old searching for a unicorn in the jungle.\n\nThere is a more hopeful prospect of materializing the same unicorn if we drew it on a paper and coloured it with all things fancy.\n\nAnd the point where it all starts is somewhere inside of us. Not outside. And, it is NOT obvious.\n\nIf there is God, I am convinced S/he is within us. And many enlightened souls travel thousands of miles to reveal that the most important journey to be undertake is that of inwards.\n\nWhether we choose to lessen the suffering of others, increase our learning or just be a better version of ourselves. It is up to the one within us. There is no appointed person somewhere in the universe bestowing a \u2018purpose\u2019 on us. To think any other way is an exercise in grandiosity. To put it in perspective, human beings arrived somewhere near midnight of 31st Dec if the universe\u2019s age was to be squeezed into our calendar. To think humanity is of any consequence is being naive in both space and time.\n\nAnd yet, each one of us is so precious that there is no one just like you in the next billions and billions of galaxies away. So your purpose is your own story, your own creation in your own universe.\n\nSure genetics and evolution have a role to play but so does our own thinking and reason.\n\nAcceptance, in fact, is the first step to radical change.\n\nAmor Fati, the Latin phrase meaning \u2018love of fate\u2019 has been invoked time and again by several masters. I love this one by Fredrick Nietzsche\n\n\u201cMy formula for greatness in a human being is Amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it\u2026 but love it.\u201d\n\nAnd then act on it.\n\nWhether it is our country, state, municipality, company or at the most granular level \u2014 our family; homo sapiens are a \u2018tribal\u2019 species.\n\nWhat however sets us apart from other animals like say gorilla with stronger arms, more flexibility, better claws and teeth are our abilities to perform collectively.\n\nThe most intelligent man on the earth can no make a simple mouse you hold in your hand entirely on his own. How will he mine the plastic, and where will he forge the tools?\n\n\u201cHuman achievements are always and everywhere collective. Every object and service you use is the product of different minds working together to invent or manage something that is way beyond the capacity of any individual mind. This is why central planning does not work. Ten million people eat lunch in London most days; how the heck they get what they want and when and where, given that a lot of them decide at the last minute, is baffling. Were there a London lunch commissioner to organise it, he would fail badly. Individual decisions integrated by price signals work, and work very well indeed.\u201d \u2014 Matt Ridley, author Rational Optimist\n\nBeyond all abstraction and philosophy, we have the power as an employee, as a writer, as a parent, to influence and be the architect of futures other than our own. We have that responsibility and doing that justly could be a life well lived."

But for you out there who have not seen it, please cooperate.\n\nIt\u2019s the optical illusion that circulated on Facebook around 2016. Look at the picture here and try to find out what object aside from brick wall is here. Give yourself a time limit.\n\nI\u2019m not going to kill your sanity by not revealing the answer. Look at the video below to see what\u2019s really going on here. If you found it, you\u2019re one of the few who saw it instantly.\n\nAfter seeing the cigar, go back to the first picture and try your best to unsee it. Try to remove it from your perception.\n\nHow did that go?\n\nI bet it\u2019s difficult to unsee the cigar. That\u2019s how our brain works. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. Once the stimulus is encoded in our brain, if you pay attention, it will always stand out.\n\nThink about the times you\u2019ve shown interest in a subject, suddenly it\u2019s everywhere. Or when you bought a certain brand of shoe, you notice people who are wearing it. Simply because you brought the matter to your consciousness. Therefore, it increased your awareness of its existence.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with what I\u2019m about to share in this post. Once you decide you want to see it, you\u2019ll see it everywhere. It\u2019s crazy because the first time I brought it to my consciousness, it feels like it\u2019s literally everywhere.\n\nTo prove to you that it works, let me share some people who paid attention to it, acted on it and literally transformed many lives from zero to billions and became no one to someone.\n\nCan you see the pattern now?\n\nPeople behind all of these names have one thing in common. You probably know where I\u2019m heading here.\n\nIf you want to truly transform your life, increase your awareness of it. Work on it until you can share it with the world on how it can also change their lives.\n\nThey\u2019re everywhere \u2014 waiting to reveal themselves for those who seek them. You see proof everywhere of how one idea can literally change our world.\n\nWho would\u2019ve thought that you can move across countries in a matter of hours? Thanks to the concept planted by the Wright brothers and further developed by other creative minds.\n\nEven the Medium we use to share information is a by-product of ideas clustered together to make it work. It benefits the person who produced it but it surely benefits millions of readers too. Look at where you are right now and notice ten things that you see around you (except Mother Nature). They\u2019re literally the product of ideas.\n\nIdeas are actually great \u2014 but they are useless.\n\nWait, didn\u2019t I just tell you that ideas created zero to billions? Why is the confusion now?\n\nHere\u2019s what Henry Ford said which sums it up:\n\nIdeas are of no use if they just remain inside. They must be nurtured and converted into tangible or actual results in order to impact the world.\n\nWhen you open your eyes to the possibility of anything, you actually welcome more opportunities. You attract ideas that can possibly transform your life and others.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI am not creative. I cannot produce that kind of ideas.\u201d\n\nWell, here\u2019s the crazy part that you should catch.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an original idea to produce an outstanding idea. Pablo Picasso once said:\n\nOf course, your senses should tell you that he didn\u2019t literally mean that you should steal other\u2019s ideas and plaster your name on it. That would mean three things: plagiarism, copyright infringement or counterfeit. All illegal in any shape or form.\n\nIt means that if you want to produce great ideas, pay attention to other great ideas and product around you.\n\nHow can you make it better?\n\nHow can you apply that idea to another area and implement the same concept?\n\nHere\u2019s how you can capture ideas and transform them into valuable products:"

        "text": "Think of all the relationships you\u2019ve developed with people in your life. Your relationship with your family, friends, significant other, boss/co-workers, clients, barista, barber, and dog walker- just to name a few. There is a reason that each of these people holds a position in your life, some out of necessity, some obligation and some out of desire. If you don\u2019t vibe with your personal trainer, then you can quickly and easily find a new one to replace them.\n\nBut what do you do when you aren\u2019t on the same page with people that you can\u2019t just replace?When you\u2019re constantly dealing with difficult or toxic people you\u2019re bound to feel a higher level of stress in your life.\n\nMost of the time, toxic people remain in our life because they are related by blood, they possess the mysterious cosmic hold over us of obligation or they play a role in us being able to pay our bills. This could be a friend that you\u2019ve known since the third grade that was there for you during a difficult time when no one else was and now you feel obligated to that friendship even though it turned toxic a while ago. Or maybe the people in your work environment are not the easiest to get along with and you aren\u2019t in a position to quit your job at Negative Nancy Headquarters.\n\nThe most common and enduring difficult relationships involves family. People who have known you your entire life, can have a bias that they know what\u2019s best for you and in some situations, this can be very frustrating. It\u2019s important that you take the time to evaluate every relationship you\u2019re investing your time, energy and soul into.\n\nAre these relationships uplifting you or depleting you?After you spend time with someone or a group of people ask yourself if you feel energized, inspired, happy, optimistic or do you feel exhausted, depressed, annoyed, anxious. This is a clear sign about the type of transaction behind the relationship.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation with difficult or toxic people that you must endure, keep these tips in mind:\n\nGo in with a plan. Strategically set your meeting, dinner or hang-out in between other appointments. Make it very clear that you only have 30 minutes or 60 minutes. Mentally prepare yourself beforehand about the direction for the conversation. Establish as many parameters as you feel necessary. Prepare yourself for how you will handle certain conversations. Have the proof, research or documents ready to support whatever you\u2019re asking for.\n\nMost difficult people you\u2019re dealing with operate like clockwork. If you already know how they\u2019re going think, respond or act then be strategic with your objective for the encounter. If there is something specific you\u2019re trying to get the other person on the same page with, then first think of something that would be even greater than what you want- even if you know there\u2019s no way it\u2019ll happen. That is what you ask for with full confidence. Then your \u201ccompromise\u201d is what you wanted all along. Pick your battles wisely and know what\u2019s worth fighting for and what\u2019s not worth your energy or peace.\n\nYou can\u2019t control how others think, speak or act, but you can control how you react. Make sure that you are coming from a place of peace or love and not out of hate, jealousy or trying to be \u201cright.\u201d When you are genuine with your words and actions you will leave these types of interactions with a much greater sense of inner peace. Focus your attention on what you can learn from this interaction. You can learn something from every person you encounter- even if you can\u2019t stand them. You will either learn something positive you want to emulate or something negative that you will avoid in your life. Hold yourself accountable during these interactions, it\u2019s far too easy to blame the other person. What can you do better to improve this relationship or situation?\n\nEvery person views the world from a different vantage point. You never know what others have been through or what has shaped the way they see things. It\u2019s okay to see the world differently on an intellectual, spiritual, financial, etc. level. Your experiences are your own and their experiences are theirs. Focus your energy on meeting as much in the middle as possible instead of expecting others to view the world from your eyes.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have a choice on your family, but you have the opportunity to choose every other person in your life. That is a great power no one can take from you. Choose wisely."

It\u2019s hard to understand the value of money when your parents pay.

        "text": "I\u2019ve had a lot of single-person projects during my life. Although there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a personal project or goal \u2014 and you should indeed have some \u2014 being too independent can sometimes keep you away from tremendous growth.\n\nI came to learn this after being stuck in personal growth a while back. I was being too independent, narrow in my perspective, and stuck in my routines. I was going blind. Blind to the things happening around me, and to the benefits that other people could provide.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I think it\u2019s extremely important to work on yourself and your personal growth. However, as I got to experience, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in only doing so.\n\nOut of this experience, and after some contemplation, a new philosophy of growth emerged:\n\nIf done right, it will give you:\n\nAll of this is possible by the power of together.\n\nWhile having a common goal is important, the relationship between the people involved is more important. A common goal can\u2019t even begin to take form if there\u2019s too much imbalance in the relationship.\n\nThe relationship should be reciprocal, satisfying on both ends and it should move towards transformation.\n\nA notion worth having in mind is that, not every relationship is going to be a \u2018common goal relationship\u2019. In fact, the minority of people in your life is going to have the same goal as you. At least in terms of a business or career goal. However, you can still grow together and reap the benefits. What\u2019s important, then, is that you have a compatible relationship. You have to be able to play together.\n\nThis means, your awesome goal, can\u2019t be disrupted by their awesome goal. And vice versa. Even though you\u2019re not working on the exact same thing, you should still be able to have a harmonious, synergetic relationship. You should still be able to be there for each other. You should still be able to grow.\n\nIn sum, the benefits applies to all kinds of relationships. From intimate relationships to business relationships.\n\nWhen we want the same things \u2014 to grow together \u2014 , but have our differences, then learning how to see each other is first priority.\n\nWithout checking in on each other \u2014 without communication \u2014 there can be no harmonious growth. Acknowledging our differences \u2014 big or small \u2014 is important.\n\nRemember that communication is more than talk. It\u2019s facial expressions, gestures, trust, honesty, and vibe. You have to be there for each other.\n\nIf you wish to grow together, you have to do more than just be in the proximity of each other. You have to engage in behaviors that\u2019s putting both of you in a state of harmony and flow.\n\nIt isn\u2019t magically going to work itself out. Effort is required on both ends.\n\nA special thing about human relationships is that, the things you put in, are often the things you\u2019re going to get out. So if you want \u2014\n\n\u2014 you\u2019re going to have to put it in.\n\nEffort is required, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\nTwo unique human beings \u2014 working together \u2014 are bound to draw inspiration from each other. You are likely to have different ideas, different point of views, and different talents. Every shade that one cannot see, can be illuminated by the other.\n\nHaving someone\u2019s encouragement makes you brave. It makes you want to step out into the world, face your fears, and strive for your goals. When you know that someone believes in you, and you know that you\u2019re safe to do your thing without judgement, you can go. You can go pursue your dreams.\n\nBy definition, having support provides you with everything that you could need. It fosters motivation, increases well-being, and minimizes stress. It also allows failure to happen, without it being destructive for long-term growth.\n\nWhen the parties involved share the \u2018what?\u2019, the \u2018how?\u2019, and the \u2018how much are you willing to sacrifice?\u2019 \u2014 of the goals \u2014 then support enables you to grow.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between your actual level of development, as determined by your own independent behaviors, and your potential level of development, as determined through behaviors in collaboration with others. Psychologist Lev Vygotsky called it the zone of proximal development.\n\nThrough the synergy of a growth relationship, the potential of your abilities heightens.\n\nThis effect works especially well, if you\u2019re growing with someone that\u2019s slightly more experienced than you. With the proper support and guidance, you\u2019ll have a possibility of reaching their level. When you\u2019re encouraged to operate at their level of ability, you\u2019re likely to end up adapting to it.\n\nIf you want more on this topic, I wrote an article explaining it in detail:\n\nAccountability keeps you on track; it forces you to stay committed to your goals.\n\nBecause accountability involves having a responsibility for each other, it keeps you from giving up and succumbing to your own individual excuses. There are real consequences for failure. Painful ones. If you actually care about the people growing together with you, then you\u2019re willing to do everything you can to avoid failure.\n\nWithout the existence of care, there would be no humans on this earth. Being cared for, fulfils a basic human need; we all need to belong. It\u2019s easy to see it\u2019s importance.\n\nCare feels incredibly good. It provides warmth, trust and safety, which in turn allows you to grow together. Actually caring for each other, is perhaps the most important factor in the relationship.\n\nWhen rapport is being built, you start to trust each other. You start to believe in each other\u2019s abilities and ideas, you start to understand each other\u2019s feelings, and the communication will flow effortlessly.\n\nRapport is continuously keeping promises to each other, and building each other up.\n\nWhen synergy takes place, there\u2019s a clash of two worlds. When different perspectives, different ideas, and different minds collide, there is an explosion. And out of the mist rises innovation \u2014 with new ideas and solutions.\n\nBrainstorm, share what\u2019s on your minds. Express your views. Explore each others worlds.\n\nEach of you, know different people, different environments, and have different experiences. Not surprisingly, this creates more opportunities.\n\nTwo means more. More doors to be opened, more things to take advantage of, and more growth in general.\n\nGrowing together is far more powerful than growing alone. There\u2019s synergy, transformation, and higher levels to be reached.\n\nIn order for collective growth to happen, a quality relationship needs to be in place. It takes communication and effort, and being there for each other. Only then can you reap the benefits.\n\nOnly then can you maximize your growth."

        "title": "What the Most Shared Content on Facebook Can Teach You About Engagement",
        "text": "Increasing your odds of going viral through science\n\nWhen publishers post content on Facebook, the goal is to grab as much positive attention as possible while engaging with your audience. But figuring out how to do that isn\u2019t always easy. Luckily, some recently released research can teach you a lot about viral content creation, particularly when it comes to how you use video.\n\nThe minds at BuzzSumo analyzed two billion articles and posts that were published on Facebook in 2017, releasing their findings to the masses. Here\u2019s an overview of the top content over the year, and some insights that can help you improve your Facebook post game.\n\nExamining the most shared content on Facebook list shows that users are often quick to spread material that is entertaining, heartwarming, or inspiring, even if it the article or video doesn\u2019t originate on the platform.\n\nWhile most posters can only dream of engaging with an audience at the level of a music video, the data also shows that content with a strong tribal element can be incredibly powerful.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of people use Facebook to keep up with the news, but the results can be somewhat hit and miss, as multiple organizations generally cover the same story. However, exclusive or breaking content can reach unicorn levels of engagement, particularly if it connects with a large audience.\n\nQuizzes have been popular since they began popping up on social media, including those that examine personality types and knowledge levels in particular subjects, but they aren\u2019t reaching the level of engagement they once did, possibly due to the degree of saturation. They also rarely result in backlinks, even though they are widely shared, perhaps because these posts are seen as fun, but not necessarily evergreen.\n\nTravel and adventure pieces, such as those discuss hot vacation destinations, can also reach epic heights, often because the content is inspiring in nature and augmented by the fact that these articles tend to use striking visual images that could serve as a mental escape from the day-to-day.\n\nHeartwarming stories can gain a lot of traction, as most people enjoy seeing the good in the world, especially in the wake of a tragedy. Further, content that is supportive in nature, acknowledging a group\u2019s hardships and offering reassurance, may also get a lot of attention.\n\nThe results of research studies or articles about scientific findings are another category that can do well on Facebook, particularly if there is an attention-grabbing headline.\n\nOn the other side, opinion posts can be big on social media, especially if they speak to something at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nThe graphic on the most viral Facebook posts genuinely highlights the power of videos on social media, with 17 of the top 20 posts featuring that format.\n\nAgain, music videos are featured heavily, as well as heartwarming and inspiring content, including multiple cute animal videos.\n\nPractical hacks and food-related videos are also frequent entries on the list.\n\nOne point some may find surprising is that four of the top 20 posts were published in Spanish and one was in French, showing that those who may not speak English, either fluently or at all, are a powerful force online.\n\nOne of the most important points made in the research is that these posts are outliers, and many of the pages that shared the content has massive audiences. The more followers a page has, the easier it is to get the content in front of users\u2019 eyes, increasing the potential for a huge number of shares.\n\nHowever, having engaging content is the key to potential social media success, as that is what attracts people to your page, leads to followers and likes, and results in shares.\n\nAs the research showed, on Facebook, video is huge, making up the vast majority of the top posts. That means, you need to start posting videos, if you aren\u2019t already, particularly because engagement levels with images and link posts have been declining rapidly.\n\nAdditionally, Facebook is favoring video content, including those produced on Facebook Live, increasing the odds of it appearing in news feeds. Since the battle against Facebook algorithms, which seem always to be changing, is on-going, shifting to a preferred format helps you get ahead.\n\nHaving a video-based strategy means your organic reach may increase and your Facebook ads could gain more traction (which is incredibly helpful if your organic ready has been dying), helping you make the most of your advertising dollars and connect with the widest possible audience. As your audience grows, it will be easier to get your content shared, especially if your focus on high-quality clips and engaging content.\n\nThe videos don\u2019t have to be lengthy to be successful, as clips as short as 90 seconds can do the trick. However, it must have a high production value, including striking images and high-quality sound, or your message isn\u2019t likely to be heard, let alone shared.\n\nIf you are looking for an angle for the video, focus on being entertaining, inspiring, or heartwarming, as these may be the easiest to incorporate. However, if practical hacks match up to your product offerings, don\u2019t ignore that route as a possibility.\n\nGet my very best Unicorn marketing & entrepreneurship growth hacks:\n\n1.

        "title": "How to Get Promoted (By Respecting The Unwritten Rule of Hierarchy)",
        "text": "How to Get Promoted (By Respecting The Unwritten Rule of Hierarchy)\n\nAccording to Saul Gellerman, in his book Motivation, when you get recommended for a promotion, your superiors are betting their reputations on you. To make them take that risk, you need to do more than just do a good job. You need to do three more things.\n\nTo distinguish yourself, you have to make it clear that you\u0092re not just a good whatever. You have to demonstrate competence in a broad range of tasks and a broad intelligence.\n\nThe better you are at what you are doing now, the greater will be the tendency to typecast you by your present job.\n\nNext, get to know as many people outside your department as possible.\n\nUse coffee breaks, get-togethers, and meetings to make your presence known and to get to know others. Show how nice you are, but display your competence too.\n\nEach new contact is an opportunity for several more. Once you\u2018ve established a rapport with someone, get him to introduce you to his colleagues or even his boss.\n\nCreate your own personal, powerful internal network on every corporate level. Keep in mind that to successfully climb the ranks, you need the support of subordinates and colleagues as well as superiors.\n\nYou can learn to manage your luck the way a good infielder readies himself for a ball that may or may not be hit toward him. The infielder thinks through what he should do if the ball comes high or low, to the left or the right, so he will not have to think as the ball races toward him.\n\nTo Gellerman\u0092\u2019s recommendations, I would add the following:\n\nIf possible, you should try \u0096 (to whatever extent possible)\u0096 to demonstrate the skills of the job you are seeking as soon as you realize you want it.\n\nYou want to show the world that you are capable of doing the job you seek well, and there\u0092s no better way to do that than by starting to do the relevant tasks before the job opens up.\n\nFirst and most obviously, volunteer to help the current jobholder. A job worth having is usually complex and demanding.\n\nThat means the person whose job you want will probably feel, at times at least, swamped. How could he resist your pleasant proposition to do the chores he doesn't\u0092 have time for?\n\nHe may refuse your offer if he doesn't trust you. If he wants to keep his job and gets the sense that you want to take it from him, expect resistance.\n\nSo, if your plan is to replace him, you need to be very careful. But if he is moving on and you are hoping to succeed him, it should be easy to ask him for work. Ask for the grunge work first. The interesting stuff will come later.\n\nRemember, the most important factor in getting ahead is to gain the trust of the people you work with \u0096 your subordinates, your colleagues, and your superiors. And you can\u2019\u0092t possibly get the confidence of all three groups unless you merit it.\n\nIn short, the way to gain trust is to be trustworthy.\n\nI am talking about respecting the fundamental unwritten rule of hierarchy:\n\nOne more thing: Identify the superior who is really in charge of your career.\n\nThis may or may not be your immediate superior. It should be, but in a broken structure, it may be the person above him.\n\nWhen it comes to self-preservation, people are at their smartest. They listen with their full attention. They watch what you do. They overhear what you say to others.\n\nAnd make up your mind that you will have integrity."

Especially new ones.\n\nI love exploring ideas\u2014twisting and turning them around in my mind, inspecting them from different angles, asking them questions, poking them, throwing them around a bit. And if they stands up to all my jostling and prodding, I love incorporating new ideas into my life, into how how I view the world.\n\nBecause when I get to incorporate new ideas into my life, I get to grow. And there\u2019s no greater high than growth, no more powerful and intoxicating drug than personal expansion. I live for it.\n\nFor me, making usually takes the form of writing. As much as I love discovering new ideas, I also love creating ideas and putting them out into the world.\n\nA lot of people talk about the anxiety of hitting PUBLISH, and watching their writing go out into the world.

Ranging over the vast wildernesses of ideas can be so pleasurable that I get lost out there. So much so that I neglect my other responsibilities and loves.\n\nAs much as I love publishing new work, producing it can be tortuous.

        "title": "Your store is an analogue experience, being measured against digital expectations",
        "text": "A quote from Amazon\u2019s founder provides the perfect introduction to this blog, providing clarity on the ever-expanding mentality of the digital giant. It is a quote that should never be ignored, as it shapes the way customers interact with businesses, which in turn echoes their shifting expectation towards brands and how much they are likely to spend with them. If companies don\u2019t move fast enough to keep up with customer\u2019s expectations, then those businesses shouldn\u2019t expect to be operating for much longer.\n\nThe current brick and mortar shopping experience holds nowhere near the same weight it did just five years ago, with the frictionless full-time digital shopping experience being the current currency of choice. This is plain to see in the United States, where some of the biggest retailers in the country have closed 5000 stores in 2017, with the digital shopping evolution creating another 1000 planned closures over 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story in the UK. The iconic department store, BHS, shut down in August 2016 and nearly two years on, one third of its 160 stores still lie empty. Demand for the high street has clearly dropped, but for those department stores that still exist and have moved their operations online, new business issues are arising.\n\nEvolving digital shopping habits are impacting the way in which we consume products in the third part of the buying cycle, \u2018evaluation of alternatives\u2019. This part of the purchasing journey is where the shopper weighs up which product is most suitable for them before purchasing the product, which is the fourth stage. When shopping online, we don\u2019t expect to taste, touch or smell the product before buying, leading to shoppers purchasing several items of the same product in multiple colours, sizes or spec, with the intention of returning the products that don\u2019t match up to our expectations.\n\nFor example, we don\u2019t try clothes on in fitting rooms anymore. Instead shoppers have evolved to be comfortable in waiting for the postman to deliver our latest purchase and try it on in our own home. This behaviour has led to 63% of online shoppers returning items they don\u2019t want during their statutory cooling off process, with retailers having to recover costs somewhere, which are fuelled by the one-click purchases, driven by ecommerce websites permanently testing UX to keep the customer engaged.\n\nThe question is, how can traditional stores that are still yet to embrace ecommerce, evolve their business, internal operations and marketing processes to appeal to a new shopping culture?\n\nStores that haven\u2019t yet moved fully into ecommerce need to seriously consider digital as their key platform, as high street sales fell 2.3% in December 2017, which is the fifth consecutive year of decline. In stark comparison, ecommerce sales were up 21.4% in December 2017 when comparing to the same period in 2016, with research from Forrester predicting that online retail sales could account for \u20ac378 billion across Europe by 2021.\n\nAmazon, in contrast to some of the historically established department stores on our high street, were born into digital and have evolved faster than most companies at scale. What were a Seattle start-up selling books online, has become an all-encompassing sprawling digital network that increased revenue by $42 billion in the last 12 months. More impressively, Amazon have played a significant part in evolving decades old shopping habits, shifting our expectations of service, speed and returns, with social media working in unison to change the ways in which we now interact and rely upon real-world brick and mortar stores.\n\n32.08 million people in the UK are employed, which is an important point, because the hours that we are working often dictate when our free time is to travel to the high street and shop. The Seattle start-up realise this and are fully aware that the general public want to shop on their own terms.\n\nAmazon have created a shopper that is totally un-reliant on brick and mortar stores, enabling them to shop on their own terms, when and where they want and still get the product delivered to them before the end of the day, through ingenuity such as Amazon Key and Amazon Locker, removing the need for you to ever knock on the door of that neighbour you dislike who has your parcel waiting for you.\n\nAmazon aren\u2019t only dealing with speciality products though. Supermarkets need to investigate ways to evolve and get further into the homes of their customers. Amazon Dash can be set-up in the cupboard where your products are stored and connected to the in-house Wi-Fi. So, when something is close to running out, just press the button and Amazon will have it delivered within the same day. The evolution here is that Amazon are moving into shopper\u2019s homes, whilst supermarkets aren\u2019t thinking further than their ecommerce experience. Which case is more revolutionary?\n\nThe ecommerce giant has evolved a platform that is blurring the boundaries of what we consider non-digital, creating a lifestyle of what I have coined, \u2018full-time online\u2019.\n\nFull-time online shopper expectations are constantly evolving, creating a culture that has no intention of communicating with high street stores in a traditional sense that the likes of M&S and BHS were used to.\n\nThe full-time online shopper mentality is constantly evolving, but the thing is, full-time online is fluid and has been around for a few years, through other sectors adopting digital and the expectations that come with it.\n\nIt can be seen from some of the everyday things that we now do. Activities that we take for granted but are intrinsically woven into our daily life. For example, 5.7 million people in the UK watch TV on demand through Netflix, Spotify is rapidly on the rise with 159 million active users, newspaper sales are famously declining however the New York Times and The Washington Post are seeing exciting numbers of digital subscription growth and the mobile only bank, Monzo, a 2015 start up already have around 400,000 active customers. The list can go on and on.\n\nFull-time online means we are online increasingly more often during the waking hours. We still access desktop relatively consistently, but mobile is eating up the hours where we would have traditionally been offline, such as sitting and watching TV in the evening, as the data from Mary Meeker highlights below.\n\nThe public are embracing full-time online without even realising it. Validation from peers provide the trust factors for adopters further down the curve, which are coming from forums and reviews which are baked into many consumer based technology platforms.\n\nMonzo has a forum acting as a key validity factor for the early majority, who are beginning to trust and adopt technology for safely storing their money in the online bank, instead of more traditional methods that include paperwork and \u2018real-world\u2019 interaction. But for the adoption to happen, consumers need to feel confident that their access to money remains safe and stable, which is the primary reason Monzo has a forum. Engaged users create validation through answering the questions of newer customers, creating endless information from an endless amount of questions people will ask about online-only banking.\n\nNetflix shows all have reviews, providing mass validity for whether a programme is worth watching. Would we ever go back to those pre-historic times of having a TV critic provide their subjective view on a programme and take it as gospel?\n\nAmazon, the company who have had a huge impact in creating this behaviour, is renowned for the wealth of user generated information on each product it offers, with 38% of shoppers using Amazon as the primary place to find out more information about a product in the early stages of the buying decision.\n\nNetflix, Spotify and Monzo can all be accessed through mobile devices. They work on-demand, are available 24 hours a day and require no human interaction. It is the exponential evolution of the mobile experience that is paramount to this shift in human behaviour, which is removing the off-line experiences of high street shopping as we knew it.\n\nForrester reported that we are yet to see a peak for consumer shopping on mobile devices. In fact, this growth is going to continue all the way up to 2021, meaning that the full-time online shift is only going to continue to keep on impacting brick and mortar stores, at levels I don\u2019t believe we are anywhere near seeing at this moment in time.\n\nThis is because brick and mortar shopping can provide a highly impersonal experience, with customers often walking around stores in search of what they are looking for, sometimes with no idea whether they will find it or not. The brick and mortar store has no idea what the customer has bought from them in the past, whether they had a good/bad prior experience or any idea of how far they have had to travel to visit their store. It\u2019s an analogue experience that is now being measured against ever evolving digital expectations.\n\nFull-time online isn\u2019t age or generation dependent. We would be foolish to think that millennials are the only shoppers that are embracing digital. 25% of Generation X and 24% Baby Boomers use Netflix as their TV provider of choice, with 66% responding that they use the channel as it enables them to watch at a time that is convenient to them.\n\nM&S is a store that is notorious for being associated with Baby Boomer and Generation X shoppers, but this isn\u2019t stopping these generations from expecting more from the high street retailer, which is leading to the closure of 30 stores around the country. Instead M&S are placing an emphasis on food stores, which they see as their point of difference. If the retailer doesn\u2019t further evolve that experience it will be interesting to see if that difference is worth anything when Amazon Go popularises itself in the UK.\n\nIn a nutshell, the speed of the web, paired with trust garnered from social validity has created a full-time online mind-set designed to free up time in a world where attention is pulled into infinite spaces, allowing shoppers to buy what they need to, so they can go back to doing what they want to do.\n\nThe majority of the Amazon buying experience is online, but they are moving into the brick and mortar shopping through Amazon Go, though its scale is small with one store in Seattle that is open Monday-Friday 7am-9pm. But this isn\u2019t your typical store and it will give the rest of the high street an insight into adopting full-time online, off screen.\n\nAmazon are looking to make their brick and mortar stores focus customer centric, through technology that can understand what the customer has taken from the shelf, and let the customer walk out of cashier-less stores, with no transaction happening in the traditional sense.\n\nA similar technology is used in Apple stores, you can pick something up such as a charging cable, scan it using the Store\u2019s App, pay with Apple Pay, receive your e-receipt and walk out without speaking to anyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the retail experience as we have ever known it. 92% of purchases are still made offline and Amazon are creating a data driven offline experience that will only fuel what it recommends to you online, further increasing consumer reliance on the all-encompassing platform.\n\nTechnology and the way that customers engage with brands online is moving through a period of constant evolution and it\u2019s encouraging to see parts of the high street embracing digital change. Debenhams have made moves to enhance the online experience for customers by building their website as a Progressive Web App, which has speeded the entire buying journey process up for online customers by an impressive 28 seconds.\n\nRoss Clemmow, Managing Director of Retail, Digital, Food & Events at Debenhams said, \u201dWe know customers get frustrated by a slow site, even more so on mobile, with as many as 70% admitting they would leave a site if it loaded slowly\u201d.\n\nFull-time online demands speed on any device that connects to the internet. Buffering and slow download speeds create experiences that are a similar irritation to queuing at check-outs in the \u2018real world\u2019 shopping experience. Optimising platform speed is why the likes of digitally born businesses such as Netflix, Amazon and ASOS are continuing to grow revenue at such high rates.\n\nIn fact, Amazon are well known within the digital industry for embracing speed online. Their CRO team are renowned for creating a near flawless online journey designed to ease the check-out process online, with one famous study showing that a page slow-down of just one second would cost the business $1.6 billion.\n\nASOS\u2019 initial point of difference to physical retailers (other than the obviously being only available online) is that they created the structure to handle high levels of deliveries and returns, which has been one of the creators of its success.\n\nNick Robertson, the co-founder of ASOS was quoted as saying the returns policy \u201c\u2026means you have customers coming back really regularly, and people are going online every week to see what\u2019s new in. ASOS made returns very easy and this took other fashion players a long time to develop, the varied options ensure loyal customers\u201d.\n\nASOS created this structure through ASOS Premier delivery membership, priced at \u00a39.95 annually, with 68% of shoppers willing to pay up to 15% more for the same product/service if assured they will have a better experience. ASOS build that service into a subscription meaning that they have the resources in place to handle the volume, whilst also encouraging brand loyalty.\n\nThe scale of digital change is dependent on the expectations your customers place on your business, but more importantly it\u2019s about your ability to understand the future of shopping habits and cater to their evolving behaviours.\n\nArgos have a high street presence but haven\u2019t been averse to add subtle changes to their offline experience by embracing technology. The retailer replaced catalogues for tablets, which presents a business trying to stay relevant, appeal to a new audience (from paper to digital) and also create service efficiencies in store. This change may not appear a big transformation, but \u2018big\u2019 is subjective.\n\nEmbracing digital also means that you give your customers a way to pay that is convenient for them. Don\u2019t create minimum transaction costs so they can use their credit/debit card, it will put them off buying from you. If the cost is a problem for your business then look at alternate methods. For example, Square have low transaction fees and no monthly retainers. Whatsapp have also improved their app to let it start processing payments. If you\u2019re business has a technical problem, then there is always a solution to that issue.\n\nCould high street stores embrace augmented reality to enable customers to try clothes on in the comfort of their own home, without physically having the items in their possession?\n\nFacebook bought the VR company, Oculus Rift. Facebook make money from advertising and data, but Oculus Rift created a product that could be part of the next jump in shopping behaviour, something that Facebook would inevitably want to be a part of.\n\nThis would help minimise returns for brick and mortar stores, as the shopper has a clear picture of what the product will look like on them or in the home before purchasing it. This reduces buyer friction and hesitation, leading to stores potentially opening up their products to a whole new market of shoppers.\n\nThe point of difference between one brands offering and the next is becoming increasingly blurred as more shoppers move to full-time online.\n\nFull-time online are a community of digital only users, who see the physical boundaries and personality of each store less, but experience the speed and efficiencies of their online presence more. It\u2019s up to the retailers to ensure that there is no feeling of compromise between their offline and online brand offering, because social validation will quickly send those stores under that don\u2019t measure up to constantly evolving expectations.\n\nThe high street needs to better understand its customer base, through the customers needs and that their expectations of the experience that is provided for them, are constantly evolving. Full-time online is an increasing group of shoppers who want to purchase on their own terms, on-demand.\n\nAmazon have evolved shopping experiences and always strive for more, as you can see from this final quote, but don\u2019t let their successes be the failure of the high street."

        "text": "The Mind-numbing Secret Behind Brands That Seem to Naturally Change the World\n\nEver wonder how some companies and organizations seem to have a knack and ability on how to change the world?\n\nWhy can some inferior products outperform superior products?\n\nThis is what I cover in this week\u2019s One Minute Wednesday, episode 17!\n\nUnfortunately, too many companies ask the wrong questions:\n\nOne company I rebranded had forgotten their own story so much, I needed to remind them and help make it relevant again.\n\nMany companies focus on its brand\u2019s features, on their unique distinctions, and the value they provide while developing or refining the product. All very legitimate activities.\n\nBut then when it comes to telling the world, they forget that this is where the real work starts and where you need as much ingenuity as when you were developing your product.\n\nYou have to put in 2X, 3X, 5X the amount of ingenuity in order to get the traction you so rightly deserve.\n\nDid you know the brand with the greater story wins?\n\nNot more features etc. but instead the one who figures out how to tell their story in a meaningful way.\n\nIf you\u2019ve missed the first 16 episodes, check them out here and subscribe.\n\nThere are vital tips to really standing out, and if you\u2019re scratching your head (or your ass) wondering which of the 8,000+ on branding to latch onto so you have the right (proven) tools, read below.\n\nWant the book that\u2019s responsible for helping businesses generate over $1 billion in sales? Then grab your hardcover copy (see what Daymond John says below) on Amazon. You will never see branding again."

        "text": "The lessons you won\u2019t find in business school\n\nMost think Mob guys are drug dealers. Not so.\n\nMy young educational years as a mafia wife included the large world of labor unions, war-machine corporations, government agencies, Wall Street and the Mob. They are all one big happy family.\n\nI had no respect for these emotionally numb pillage warriors of society.\n\nFrom age 16, I watched as ruthless strategies, master calculations and cunning deals became \u201cthe business of the day.\u201d\n\nNot until years later did I realize this knowledge was my college education.\n\nThis education needed to serve me as I started over.\n\nIn the world I lived, when you leave, you receive no alimony, funds to start over or even child support.\n\nI navigated through years of fear and sleepless nights trying to grow into my own significance.\n\nI used what I learned to hone my life skills in a positive way.\n\nHere are 7 key take-away\u2019s that have stuck with me\n\nMany have it.\n\nYou need confidence and personal power to have self-esteem. I believe you need to consciously work on this to grow.\n\nConfronting my low self-worth from years of being ignored and no moral support became top priority.\n\nI did not know I even had it for years.\n\nIt\u2019s not empowering to feel like crap because you have no personal power or strength.\n\nEven after winning 4 gold medals at the world skydiving championships for the U.S. Parachute Team (the first American woman to do so) \u2014 I still did not feel I was good enough.\n\nThis is some serious shit to work on.\n\nBe kind to yourself\n\nStart making each step of your reinvention feel like you won a gold medal.\n\nI say to myself: \u201cOh dear one, you are growing something so new and special. Keep going.\u201d\n\nMob guys have a strong self-reliance. They place their bets based on what they can achieve on their own.\n\nYou will never see them waste years working in any demeaning way.\n\nThey own and buy into their ideas and intentions, even if it is fucked up.\n\nAs they devise strategies and plans, they are never caught up in wasting time and energy. They stay focused on their business and always explored new boundaries.\n\nNot working for others became the biggest factor for how I went forward in life.\n\nOver the years, I realized I had invested in Freedom \u2014 not things. Betting on myself was the best bet I ever made.\n\nWhen I left, I started my own business ventures \u2014 without backing or funding.\n\nWithout cash flow, you will have problems right from the beginning.\n\nFor every solution you believe you solved, there will be problems within those solutions.\n\nMob men are masters at handling this type of uncertainty. They look at everything as matter of fact \u2014 what is.\n\nEven though they always have money and backing, awareness and positioning is their tool.\n\nTheir intuitive thinking is like none other, and their understanding expands as they assess their situation.\n\nThey have the where-with-all to navigate in fractions of seconds and do not buy into fear.\n\nSolving problems is like an art-form. You need to have a clear picture of what the real problem is and then make; Plan A \u2014 Plan B \u2014 and a Plan C.\n\nThis goes along with the next step:\n\nThey back themselves with so many alternatives, that no matter which way the deal goes, they come out on top.\n\nThey have clarity and work strategically, which means they can formulate a plan and follow it.\n\nAnd they never miss new opportunities that are only a glimpse.\n\nNever, do this in any position you hold.\n\nThis is how Mob guys set people up.\n\nIf you take the responsibility and things go wrong (as they always do), and you cannot make change because you have no authority, you will become the fall person.\n\nI also learned it is best to never take a Title. As soon as you take a title, you are set up to fail.\n\nOne example is a consulting project I took to rebuild a wellness retreat for a resort. Over 20 people had been hired \u2014 given titles and then were gone within a few months.\n\nI observed the situation and knew; \u201cdon\u2019t take a title, and don\u2019t take the responsibility because no one here has the authority to make a decision.\u201d\n\nThey made me General Manager but, I did not take the title. I said I would work the contract but wanted no title. None-the-less, and even more so, everyone considered me the boss.\n\nIn the Taoist martial arts world, that I\u2019m so fond of, this means leading even though you are behind. You move last but arrive first.\n\nThis is your best position.\n\nEach Mob boss has their own style and power.\n\nWhatever they were well known for was because they were the best at what they did.\n\nIn a sense, they built their own Brand. It served them well, even if it was for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt takes reinventing yourself often.\n\nIt is best to reinvent yourself even when you don\u2019t believe you need to. It should be a regular part of your Life Plan.\n\nReinventing yourself continuously helps to break through living a life of dull habits, which blocks your ability to see.\n\nIt takes immense self-observation to be different. You need to be alert to it and have the essence to grab an opportunity and work through it.\n\nThrough years of watching deal-making schemes, I observed how their projects always worked out.\n\nThey set up their deals in two ways; they were either providing a favor \u2014 or calling in a favor.\n\nEverything was just a phone call away and handled quickly.\n\nNo matter who it was; people in government agencies, greedy corporations, or greedy people, everyone could be bought in some way.\n\nIt\u2019s all about deciding who gives what \u2014 who does what \u2014 who owes who and the outcome that is needed.\n\nAnd what I realized early on is that none of this business was ever done for the good of humanity, or for others outside the circle.\n\nAnd it still isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the same story.\n\nVision the good that could happen worldwide very quickly if all these greedy people provided some projects to bring humanity forward instead of hoarding their greedy abundance and ugly self-interests.\n\nSo appreciate the Claps and new connections -"

        "text": "The 4 Easy Ways of Getting More Done By Doing Less\n\nEarlier this week I sat at a big conference table alongside some really smart people, with many important tasks vying for their attention, and (like all of us) too little time to complete them all.\n\nI\u2019d been summoned to this meeting to train this high functioning group on the not-so-trivial task of getting more done in less time.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question with some interesting answers\u2026\n\nAs legendary philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius so aptly pointed out over two millennia:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s essential: To do less, better.\u201d\n\nAnd this is where we began our discussion. Not with sneaky tactics, productivity hacks, or fancy apps. But rather with the idea that you must never mistake busyness with effectiveness.\n\nThe 80/20 Rule (also known as the Pareto Principle) is a fairly well-discussed phenomenon, but simply put, it states that (across all disciplines and areas of life) only about 20% of inputs are responsible for roughly 80% of the outputs.\n\nThough many of us are aware of this dictate, an unfortunately high percentage of us fail to apply it effectively to our lives.\n\nInstead, we spin our wheels in hot pursuit of more, more, more. Trying to tackle an ever expanding list of to-dos under the misguided hope that it\u2019ll somehow help.\n\nAll you\u2019re doing is burning yourself out completing tasks that, if you were to take a step back and answer truthfully, you\u2019d realize aren\u2019t actually helping.\n\nSo, operating under the framework that the bulk majority of tasks aren\u2019t worth doing, let\u2019s talk about the 4 ways you can actually check items off your to-do list to get more done."

You dream of becoming an entrepreneur one day.\n\nAnd here you are \u2014 you still have a day job. It pays the bills and keeps you secure. You want to start your side hustle but you don\u2019t know how to start.\n\nWe are all in the same boat. I had a day job and I\u2019d work on my own thing after office hours.\n\nBut I had a problem. I thought I was making progress. When I audited my time \u2014 it was filled with watching YouTube and not making any real progress. I prided myself on being a night owl and that it\u2019s my most productive time, but the records show the opposite.\n\nI didn\u2019t make any progress in pursuing a side hustle. I didn\u2019t have the time, energy or money. So I decided to save up money and dive head first. I pursued my hustle full time.\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, this is what I\u2019ll do.\n\nAudit your time, energy and money. It is imperative to know where these three things go.\n\nTime and Money are easy to track.\n\nI use my mac calendar to track everything I do. Meditation, Morning pages, shower, taking a dump, cooking, etc. Nothing is exempted.\n\nSocial media and watching YouTube? Write that down on your calendar, if you do this right \u2014 no white space should be left.\n\nFor finances, my app of choice is YNAB. I am part of the cult of people who track their expenses until the last cent. Make sure that you are not spending money on things that don\u2019t matter \u2014 stop impulse buying.\n\nLastly, track your energy levels. This not some voodoo chakra or healing energy, this is general willpower and effort level. My most unproductive time is after lunch because my energy wanes. I am most productive early in the morning and evenings. Find your sweet spot.\n\nI get to do more when I have less on my list.\n\nThis is minimalism at work. Remove all the unnecessary work and fluff. Is it required to bring your phone when you\u2019re taking a dump? This surprisingly extends my time to thirty minutes.\n\nStreamline your process. All the nooks and crannies will show themselves if you do step one right.\n\nA surprising tactic I\u2019ve discovered recently is that I disconnect the home router early in the morning and before I sleep. This will force me to remove all social media and YouTube \u2014 my biggest distractions.\n\nNow that you have audited and removed, it\u2019s time to allocate.\n\nDuring the start of the week, I budget my 168 hours. Read the book by Lauren Vanderkam, 168 hours. It\u2019s the number of hours you have in one week.\n\nYou are the general of your calendar and position your chess pieces into the canvass. Are you having a hard time finding a regular exercise schedule? Do it first thing in the morning.\n\nCut your lunch break short and allow thirty minutes of your time to create a side hustle. After 5 PM, head straight to a cafe and work on your business until 8 PM, that\u2019s three hours of work.\n\nIf you budget your time, it will happen. It\u2019s hard to push yourself at the moment and be reactive \u2014 take a proactive approach."

Whether you saw it coming or not, the feeling is the same: you\u2019re devastated. You gasp at your vulnerability and wonder, \u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d.\n\nLife comes with many hardships: heartbreak, injury, illness, death, desertion. Though we may share similar experiences, every pain is personal. No matter how many times people say, \u201cI understand\u201d, they don\u2019t. You may even resent them for trying.\n\nYou see, when you\u2019re savagely knocked down by life, don\u2019t get right back up. Imagine yourself tripping or falling, you have the impulsive habit to get right up, dust yourself off, and move on again. However, when you have a severe injury, you can\u2019t ignore it because you know it will make it worse. This is the same with emotional pain.\n\nPain, both physically and emotionally, demands attention because it needs to be acknowledged and embraced before you can move on.\n\nThe avoidance of pain only increases pain. Emotional wounds are beyond sadness. They\u2019re felt in the depths of your whole being. Honour your pain, don\u2019t run from it. Unplug, put time aside to reflect, and give yourself permission to grieve. If people push you to \u201cget over it,\u201d ignore them. Time and patience are key to recovery.

It\u2019s the beauty and strength of Agile mindset that we have on our team. So, let\u2019s discuss the elephant in the room.\n\nThe problem with the tech industry today is the demand changes, the expectation changes and no one has got the time to make it happen. We shifted from a model where everything is dropped one after the another (waterfall) to a very much incremental approach, Where everything is done in bits and pieces and shipped early.\n\nBefore discussing why Agile let\u2019s discuss Agile? Agile Project Management is a software development approach which brings members together; let them work in a collaborative environment. Which is iterative in nature. Agile is an umbrella term for the set of methods and practices used for developing software.\n\n\u201cWork early but craft incremental experiences with an end vision\u201d -Karen Leong\n\nOver the time we learned that we should plan more often. We are sold on the idea of planning where we have to be but the solutions to the problems change with the needs, changes in the expectations in a dedicated time frame.\n\n\u201cPlanning Is Everything. The Plan Is Nothing.\u201d \u2013Dwight Eisenhower\n\nWe practice Extreme Programming in our team in which pair programming which helps our team in solving a bigger problem with two or more people on the same screen.\n\nWe prefer a culture of morning meetings where everyone discusses the Problems and Progress of last day, Goals for today and dependencies amongst the team with a time-bound to avoid the unnecessary. The daily Evaluation of the Problem, Quality, and Duration of the premium delivery.\n\n\u201cThe more elaborate our means of communication the less we communicate\u201d \u2014 J. B. Priestley\n\nWe have the freedom to try new things and fail. As we follow Incremental solutions we are less likely needed to change all the things all together. If something goes wrong shift to last days build and you are good to go again.\n\nWe have daily goals, we evaluate needs on daily basis and decide what we have to change and works with our pipeline structure as well.\n\n\u201cIntelligence is the ability to adapt to the change.\u201d -Stephen Hawking\n\nWe all sit together at least twice a day to bring the whole team on the same page and also to get the feedback on the latest build that we have.\n\n\u201cNone of us is as smart as all of us..\u201d -Ken Blanchard\n\nOur day starts with the morning meeting with a timer so as to keep a check on the unnecessary; where we talk about the problems and progress of the last day the goals and works for today with the dependencies for all the team member and if any other help is required. We use trello internally to keep the whole team on the same page. We work together on the various issues and share the build at least once every day with the team and change as we get feedback.\n\nOur Developers use a single big screen when implementing the build it makes the problems easier to solve; \u201cSmall works, done well, and quickly\u201d. We respond to changes in following a guide for making it even more functional. For us, the working software is more important than a comprehensive documentation.\n\nI would Love to hear from you.

Most of us embrace the idea and even more, we expect it from others. Yet in practice, it seems more a platitude than a value.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s human nature to focus on our own needs or problems and to believe our version of the story.\n\nA small world that often leads to narrow perspectives, broken communication, poor decisions and damaged relationships.\n\nWe miss the message because we dislike the messenger.\n\nWe dictate the solution without understanding the problem.\n\nAll for an unwillingness to part with our favorite pair of shoes.\n\nThe way we walk in another\u2019s shoes is through language and experience.\n\nLanguage through the art of listening with the intent to understand both what is said and unsaid. Asking questions and refining our understanding until we can, as much as possible, fully appreciate, reflect and restate the other person\u2019s perspective.\n\nExperience through the act of going where they go, to see what they see, hear what they hear and in some cases do what they do. Experiencing it for ourselves and not assuming we understand how it is in their world or that we can judge it from afar.\n\nThis practice serves not only the person to whom we give our time and attention but ourselves as well.\n\nThey, like us, will appreciate the opportunity to be seen, valued and understood.\n\nWe, in turn, may earn a new level of respect and the right to be heard, thus expanding our influence.\n\nBoth sides create new possibilities for cooperation and creativity.\n\nUltimately we become better acquainted with ourselves, our limitations, beliefs, and perceptions. Our world becomes a little larger and our eyes a little clearer.\n\nAnd perhaps they pay it forward so that at least in some small way, the world is a little less divided.\n\nI have a friend who, as a matter of daily practice, walks with someone every morning.\n\nIt\u2019s common for him to invite someone he only recently met to join him on his walks. He\u2019ll exchange numbers and say \u201cmeet me at 6:30 am and we\u2019ll walk together.\u201d Other walking companions are people he\u2019s known for many years.\n\nHe never misses a day to walk with someone. Sometimes he\u2019ll take 2 or 3, one-hour walks in a morning with different people. He even plans his vacations around taking walks with his family or close friends.\n\nTo hear him talk about it, this practice teaches him to love and appreciate all types of people and gives him a deeper respect for the challenges they face. He receives strength and wisdom through their stories.\n\nIn return, he gives his time, attention, empathy, and encouragement. People seek him out just to go for a walk. Because he\u2019s walking in their shoes by walking beside them and listening to their stories.\n\nTake off your shoes."

These are the growth rate of my Medium followers and email newsletter subscribers. My goal is to grow both figures by 10% every week.\n\nI succeed at the newsletter goal one week and fail the next week. This one on, one off pattern has been going on for a month now.\n\nSo far, I tried to optimize my blog post writing skills. I did that by analyzing my Medium stats. I learned a lot of lessons on blogging and I shared them in a series of posts.\n\nSure, there is still room for improvement in my writing, but I want to focus on my blog at the moment. There\u2019s even greater room for improvement in my blog.\n\nMy traffic numbers aren\u2019t that bad, but I have a difficult time converting that traffic into email newsletter subscriptions. I\u2019ll focus on this conversion for a month or so.\n\nI started using Google Analytics to accomplish my goal. That wasn\u2019t a good idea. I warned my readers not to jump on to a tool without having a plan first. I made that mistake. I didn\u2019t think whether Google Analytics was the right tool for this job.\n\nGoogle Analytics is a fantastic tool. When I get into a tool like that, I can spend weeks, months, and even years working on it. I could still learn something after a year of using it. However, that\u2019s not my goal.\n\nI warned against this type of tech abuse in the post Use Tech as an Accelerator, not as an End. I even wrote a post yesterday called Data Is the Gold If You Know How to Use It. Yet, I still spent hours on Google Analytics without any results.\n\nAfter hours of unfruitful work, I went away from my computer. I sat down with pen and paper. I brainstormed and wrote the first draft of this post.\n\nAn interesting insight from Google Analytics was the search queries people used on my website. Those search queries gave me some ideas for blog posts.\n\nOne of those search queries was \u201chow write every day.\u201d I think my visitor was curious about how I publish a post every day. Actually, that would be easy if I didn\u2019t have a full time job. But it\u2019s hard on top of a full time job.\n\nImproving My Productivity to Keep Up with the Daily Publication Schedule\n\nI\u2019m still improving my productivity and workflow. I plan to report my writing routine once it reaches a certain point.\n\nThere\u2019s some inner game that goes into this as well. I find it interesting how my psychology plays tricks on me. Then I play tricks on my psychology in return to keep up with my daily publication schedule.\n\nIf you want to read more about how I keep up with my daily schedule, stay in touch by subscribing to my email newsletter. I plan to write about this in the upcoming days.\n\nAfter using Google Analytics for a few hours, I realized that I didn\u2019t need to spend all of those hours. I could get what I needed in ten minutes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the answer to those questions, you\u2019ll end up wasting your time. At the end, you might end up knowing a lot about Google Analytics without adding any value to your business.\n\nMy Goal and How I Plan to Accomplish It\n\nMy goal is simple: to improve the conversion rate of my blog traffic to newsletter subscriptions. In order to do that, I need to improve the design of my blog.\n\nI already worked on my writing. If the design of my blog isn\u2019t good, I won\u2019t be able to reach my goals no matter how good I write. The effects of both components are like factors in a multiplication.\n\nDetermine the Factor that Has the Biggest Room for Improvement\n\nIf my writing is at 80% and the design of my blog is at 20%, my conversion rate will be at 16%. After a certain threshold, improving one factor will only add marginal value.\n\nAccording to the 80% \u2014 20% figures above, there\u2019s 25% improvement left in my writing. If I focus on my writing, I can improve my results by 25% at max.\n\nBased on the same assumption, there\u2019s 500% improvement potential in my website design. I can improve my results up to 500%, if I focus on the design of my website.\n\nWhen I start a project such as updating the design of my website, the possibilities are virtually endless. Even though that sounds good, it is overwhelming at the same time. That\u2019s why I wrote the post, How to Deal with the Challenge of Infinite Possibilities when Starting a Business.\n\nIf it was up to me, I\u2019d start with the about page and the homepage. But when I look at Google Analytics, I see a different picture.\n\nIf you look at the top ten pages in Fig. 1, you might think that the homepage is the most important page. It accounts for 10% of the page views. That means if I improve the homepage, I improve only 10% of my website design.\n\nThere are eight pages that refer to blog posts in the top ten list. When I look at the complete list, more than 80% of the page views are blog post views. If I improve the design of the blog posts, I\u2019ll improve 80% of the website.\n\nImproving the design of the blog posts is relatively easy in WordPress. All I have to do is to update a few files in the theme that I use.\n\nOnce I make that update, I\u2019ll wait for a few weeks to see its effects. I can hardly think that those changes would result in a worse conversion rate than the current design.\n\nI haven\u2019t thought about the current design. I just used the standard theme and added a subscription box at the bottom.\n\nThere are already some improvement ideas in my mind. These ideas are inspired by Medium and the Startup publication.\n\nA Link to the Email Newsletter at the Top. There\u2019s no information above the fold that indicates that I have an email newsletter. The only exception to that is the email newsletter subscription page.\n\nI like the way the Startup Publication named their link. They called it \u201cGet Smarter at Building Startups.\u201d In my case, even calling this \u201cNewsletter\u201d would be better than what I have now.\n\nThe Position of the Subscription Box. The subscription box is under the post, social share buttons, related posts list, and the category and tags list. The subscription box could be between the social share buttons and the related posts list.\n\nAuthor Information Bar. I\u2019ll include an author information bar at the top, including my picture, my name, and a short bio. I was procrastinating on writing my Medium bio. Once I have a short bio, I\u2019m going to use it on my blog and on Medium.\n\nA Short Pitch in the Posts. This is not a design update, but it can increase the newsletter subscriptions. I included a pitch in this post. I gave a hint about a post that I\u2019m going to publish in the upcoming days. I can do that in future posts as well.\n\nWhen updating a project, focus on the component that has the biggest room for improvement. In my case, that is the design of my blog post pages.\n\nTechnology can be a pitfall at work. Don\u2019t use a piece of technology just because it\u2019s a good tool. Use it only if it serves your goals. Use it as a means to your ends. Don\u2019t use it just to use it, no matter how fun it is.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate it if you could give me some tips to improve my email newsletter subscription numbers. Let me know in the comments if you have any ideas how I can improve this stat."

        "text": "California has one of the most powerful economies in the world leading in industries such as high technology, international trade, healthcare, agriculture and energy. According to 2016 data by the World Bank, California is ranked to have the sixth largest economy in the world, standing only behind the entire United States itself, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe report also highlighted an industry that propelled the state\u2019s growth to surpass the French economy \u2014 manufacturing. Manufacturing for generations was always hailed as the gateway and staple to the middle class and any evidence claiming that manufacturing is non-existent are false and there is encouraging data to support it.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) organization, manufacturing in the state of California accounts for 11.1% of the total output for the state \u2014 valued at an output of $288.98 Billion in 2016. The report shows key encouraging signs for manufacturing growth in the state, especially for three very important reasons:\n\nAs of 2014, total manufacturing output for the state stood at $255.53 Billion with a surge in 2015 increasing to $278.58 Billion. Furthermore, increasing by an additional $10 Billion throughout 2016.\n\nWhat is more encouraging is the wage growth occurring within the overall manufacturing industry. The average annual wage was $92,801 in 2014, growing to $96,711 in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the average annual wage continued its growth within the industry crossing the six-figure mark growing to $100,060 according to NAM data.\n\nThe non-profit research organization also highlighted a consistent growth in the amount of manufacturing firms on an annual basis. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing firms grew from a total of 35,756 as of 2013 to 36,117 as of 2015.\n\nThe growth is lead by manufacturing sectors such as high technology, chemical products and the food, beverage and tobacco space.\n\nThroughout the spread-out Southern California region, lie inland suburban cities in the Greater Los Angeles basin, where manufacturing is the leader in their respective local economies.\n\nAn example of this is the city of Corona positioned just east of the Orange County border and south of the San Bernardino County line. Corona exemplifies how manufacturing has served as a staple for the city, generating newer business growth and attraction that supplement its demographics.\n\nThe manufacturing industry leads diverse industries comprising approximately 15\u201317% of the city\u2019s total employment. With higher wage growth associated with the industry, the city has developed a reputation known for residential properties, affordable family-led housing, strong educational system correlating with a richer economic environment and a more cost-effective alternative to its Orange County counter parts.\n\nWith manufacturing serving as the foundation to a city and a region overall, such as Corona, newer businesses and innovation soon become a follower and a major factor to future economic growth.\n\nThis serves as an important reminder that manufacturing across the state of California is not dead despite many notions, but retooled and reborn adapting to rapid technological advances leading suburban growth and employment opportunities."

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I was on my morning commute to the gym. There was another car about 50 yards ahead of me and I was on autopilot.\n\nWe approached an intersection with a long green light.\n\nAs I was about to enter the intersection, a car flew down the cross street from my left at about 40mph.\n\nThe car zoomed straight through the red light and into the intersection.\n\nRight at the split second the car crossed over\u2026nothing happened.\n\nThe red-light driver threaded the needle perfectly between myself and the car in front of me. It happened so fast I didn\u2019t even have time to hit the brakes.\n\nMy adrenaline was through the roof but I was in one piece.\n\nI was driving with my wife, who was pregnant with our son at the time. We were coming home in the afternoon from a BBQ at a friend\u2019s house.\n\nIt was around dusk and we were listening to music and chatting.\n\nWe approached an intersection with a long green light.\n\nRight at the split second we crossed over\u2026WHAM!\n\nOur car was t-boned by an SUV going about 40mph. It hit with so much force that we flipped over and slid about 50 feet.\n\nLuckily, we survived. My wife injured her arm but did an amazing job protecting our son who was only 17 weeks along. He was born later that year and is now a healthy, amazing 3rd grader.\n\nSo, what was the difference between those two experiences?\n\nThe cars and locations were different but the circumstances were very similar. In one case my timing was perfect. In the other, not so much.\n\nA few seconds difference in either case could have resulted in a totally different outcome.\n\nBusiness opportunity timing isn\u2019t usually as volatile as driving through an intersection, but it can have just as much of an impact (ahem).\n\nWhen it comes to business, we all want to believe that being in the driver\u2019s seat keeps us in control. All we have to do is set our course and go. If we\u2019re good drivers, we\u2019ll get to our destination in one piece.\n\nBut the reality is that there are all sorts of external forces that affect the success of our journey. It\u2019s not as simple as setting the right course. Your timing is critical too.\n\nOne of my first startup products was a calorie tracking service. It allowed users to set a daily calorie limit and then track their meals against it.\n\nWhat made it different was that you did the tracking via text message.\n\nEvery time you ate something, you sent a text with the names of the food to the service. It would automatically retrieve nutritional info on the items and log them in your account. If you got close to your calorie limit it would text you a warning.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound so crazy now, but this was 2007. That year marked the tipping point when Americans sent and received more text messages each month than made phone calls.\n\nTwitter had launched a year earlier. When I pitched this to people as \u201cTwitter for your diet\u201d there were lots of blank stares.\n\nI was able to get a small group of users to pay a monthly subscription fee, but there wasn\u2019t enough to keep it going.\n\nWas the concept bad? I don\u2019t think so. Was the timing bad? Yup.\n\nMaybe a big company with a real marketing budget could have raised awareness enough to make it sustainable. Even with more money though, it was early in the market.\n\nThere was too much mental friction for someone to see how this would fit into their life.\n\nIn an interesting twist, I\u2019m now able to confirm that the core idea really was good. I\u2019ve recently had the opportunity to work with a company called Eat This Much. Their product tackles some of the same core needs around nutrition tracking.\n\nEat This Much\u2019s product is infinitely better and more sophisticated than mine ever was. And because it\u2019s now second nature for people to track actions via their phone, their timing is way better too.\n\nOn the topic of car crashes, I mentored a young entrepreneur recently who\u2019s working on a product to help with vehicle collision detection.\n\nThe product provides warnings to get a driver\u2019s attention if their vehicle is in danger.\n\nIt\u2019s a great idea that has the potential to save lives. When it comes to user needs, it doesn\u2019t get much more important than that.\n\nThe problem I see is timing.\n\nThe technology this person is working on is already standard in many vehicles. By 2022, manufacturers have committed to include automatic emergency braking technology in all new cars.\n\nOf course there are still plenty of older vehicles that could be retrofitted with this technology.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t a market. There may even be a significant market for this. The question is, how big is the window for that market? If we\u2019re 4 years from every new car having this technology by default, how fast is the opportunity window closing?\n\nAnd if the tech is about to become ubiquitous, how many other manufacturers will see an opportunity in the retrofitting space?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean this person should abandon the idea. If the window is narrow they could still create something meaningful even if it\u2019s only for a limited period.\n\nThe important note is to take a hard look at the market landscape and make an informed decision on your direction.\n\nIt takes a long time to realize success with a business.\n\nIf you think it\u2019ll happen within a couple years, you\u2019ll likely be disappointed. Thinking in terms of a 7\u201310 year span to reach the real potential of an idea is a safer guess.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s worth pausing to assess your opportunity window.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t accurately predict what will happen even 1\u20132 years from now, it\u2019s worth checking your idea against current trends.\n\nMinus a crystal ball, there aren\u2019t perfect answers to these questions. But if you\u2019re not at least considering them you could set yourself up for a dangerous intersection crossing.\n\nIf you want some help assessing the position of your business, download our free innovation worksheets below:"

You can\u2019t see it but as soon as you declare yourself an entrepreneur, you get a seat at the table.\n\nThis is more of a curse than an honor. Yet, you will think it\u2019s an honor and you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life living up to it.\n\nThe worst part about this table is that there is an unspecified amount of money lying on it that you don\u2019t know is there.\n\nAll you\u2019re told is that there\u2019s a lot of money on the table, and you better not leave any of it there.\n\nThere\u2019s not just money on the top. These riches engulf the table. Treasure troves littered on top. $100 bills entwining themselves down the legs like ivy. In my mind, the table rises into the sky like a perverse capitalistic version of Jack and the Beanstalk.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how much money you\u2019re leaving on the table, but the more you learn about entrepreneurship, the bigger the table gets and the more hypothetical money sits there, waiting for you to figure out how to conjure it into the real world.\n\nI figured out one way to get more money from the table in the last few months, and I wanted to share it with you. I\u2019ll share how I went from making $1,000/month from one eBook to $2,300 for the same eBook, with just a few simple tweaks.\n\nI sell an eBook called Step By Step Mixing: How to Create Great Mixes Using Only 5 Plug-ins. Chances are, you\u2019re not interested in the subject and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a very niche subject and I happen to love being an influencer and educator in the niche. I love helping home studio musicians improve their audio engineering and music production. One of the ways my audience supports me back is buying my book.\n\nI originally sold this eBook exclusively through Amazon as a Kindle eBook. It hit #1 on the Amazon Best-Seller list in its category when it came out, and it\u2019s more or less stayed there since then. I wrote about my experience with launching a best-seller in a different medium article that you can open up in one more tab on your browser right here.\n\nFrom February 1st to March 2nd I sold 295 copies for $4.99 each. That\u2019s about $1,472 in revenue but because Amazon takes a 30% cut, I only make $1,030.44 in royalties."

Growing up without siblings forces you to discover your surroundings, discover yourself and to throttle your imagination towards entertainment. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I had plenty of cousins and friends. But I still spent a great deal of formative time creating, inventing and testing boundaries in a pre-internet world of limited TV and video game access. If \u2018necessity is the mother of invention,\u2019 being an only child is the father of creativity.\n\nI cycled through various interests in my adolescence, thinking in elementary school that being a plastic surgeon would be a creative way to help people and make lots of money. Then in high school, as I became more exposed to traditional advertising, I came to like the idea of working at an ad agency. And as I started college, I was certain that I wanted to move to NYC and creatively express myself as a staff writer for Conan O\u2019Brien.\n\nNone of this was relevant when I became enthralled by Facebook in college, and started to spin with ideas for complementary social services. I launched a Facebook-like service catered to high school students the same day that Facebook opened its doors to high school students. I launched a precursor to mobile check-in service, Foursquare, before there were mobile operating systems like Android or iOS, which made a system predicated on text protocol, extraordinarily difficult to sustain. I developed a broader community platform for college students called The Quad, but raised money through the public markets during a major economic downturn, which relegated the idea unable to raise more money during a critical time of growth.\n\nSo I essentially failed forward with an MBA from real life experiences, all the way to the front steps of Brand Knew, a creative agency and technology studio. I co-founded Brand Knew to leverage everything I\u2019ve learned, towards serving clients like YouTube, E! Entertainment, Stand Up 2 Cancer, President Obama, Nike, EL AL Airlines, Mayor Garcetti and Universal Pictures, with custom strategies for building brand equity and piercing through all of the digital noise.\n\nNow I\u2019m a perpetual student, learning each day from leaders of industry and lending our creativity to their respective missions.\n\nThere are plenty of interesting stories and great / funny moments, but probably best to hone in on one of the most embarrassing moments.\n\nSince the iPhone launched in 2007 with the automated mobile email signature \u201cSent from my iPhone\u201d, I\u2019ve been playfully advancing my devices each year by one generation, in an effort to throw off recipients of my emails. By the time Brand Knew started in 2009, the iPhone 3G read \u201cSent from my iPhone 4G\u201d (a device that never existed). By 2013, my iPhone 5 read \u201cSent from my iPhone 6\u201d. I always anchored that statement with a cryptic \u201cas part of the Apple Elite Enterprise Program (AeeP #5z19*rs)\u201d. This designation, coupled with my immersion into the Los Angeles tech scene, seemed to legitimize the notion that I would have a device that was simply impossible to have. The random sequence of digits and letters are just my birthday and initials, adorned by a random asterisk that serves no purpose. People would often email me back and demand to know how I\u2019d gotten a hold of a next generation device. Usually, I wouldn\u2019t respond. On occasion, someone would email me and ask how I was liking said impossible-to-get device and insist that they were thinking of picking it up this week. In these cases, I would respond that I was loving it, in hope that they would go to an Apple store and actually ask to buy it.\n\nBy 2014, I\u2019d bored of this routine and opted for a tease of a device that had long been rumored, but that no one had. \u201cSent in a timely fashion from my Apple Watch as part of the Apple Elite Enterprise Program (AeeP #5z19*rs).\u201d About 5 years into our business, we were picking up steam and working with some higher profile organizations. I had two important meetings that happened to fall on the same day; one with the CEO of a major movie studio, and one with the Vice Chairman of a major record label. I had confirmed both meetings that morning from my cell phone (an iPhone 6).\n\nI drove to my first meeting on the studio lot and waited in the lobby for a few minutes until the studio head\u2019s assistant invited me in to his office. We exchanged pleasantries, as he noticeably gazed towards my wrist several times. He was complimentary of our services and the technology I was pitching. And then before the meeting ended, he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the watch?\u201d I was wearing a regular watch. I looked at him confused and nervous and stumbled out the words, \u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s 11:32\u201d He looked at me like I\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Apple Watch?\u201d I looked at him blankly for what must have been a deafening 5 seconds of silence and just said, \u201cIt\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s a Breitling.\u201d He stared back at me and after a few seconds, just said, \u201cOK, well thanks for coming in.\u201d I awkwardly backed out, in what inside my head must have looked like a servant exiting the Queen\u2019s quarters.\n\nI never considered that someone so smart in such a powerful position would genuinely think I\u2019d have access to an Apple product before it came out. It was one of the most awkward professional moments I\u2019d had. Until that afternoon\u2026\n\nI drove to my second meeting at the record label and then waited for this music industry luminary in the lobby. We\u2019d met several times before, so he casually emailed me to say he was running late. I shot back a quick \u2018no problem\u2019 reply. His assistant finally ushered me back to his office where he was finishing a call behind is giant desk. He looked at me unusually quizzically, while I sat on his couch, repeating \u2018uh huh\u2019, \u2018uh huh\u2019, \u2018I didn\u2019t think so\u2019 on the phone. He hangs up the phone and comes to sit next to me on the couch. \u201cThere\u2019s no Apple Elite Program. I would know!\u201d This was a label with very strong ties to Apple. \u201cThat was Eddy\u2026 Cue (one of the Apple executives second in line to Tim Cook). There\u2019s no Elite Program. I can\u2019t believe I bought that bullshit. He asked me what I was talking about when I asked where my watch was! Last time I fall for that one.\u201d I probably turned pretty red, but this guy was just one of the loveliest human beings and we continued on with our meeting. This was one of the most uncomfortable days I\u2019ve had since running Brand Knew.\n\nThe odds of that happening twice in one day, and zero times since, have got to be extraordinary.\n\nToday my signature reads, \u201cSent from my iPhone XD.\u201d Bad habits die hard.\n\nWhen my business partner and I decided that we were going to develop a full service creative agency, we recognized how Herculean a task this would be, and how many creative, advertising, social, digital, design, development, media buying agencies there are. We would be going to market with a good sense of self, but against hundreds of organizations offering similar services. We set out to ensure that our agency services would subsidize our interest in building proprietary products\u2026 something we believed strongly would help differentiate ourselves in a competitive marketplace.\n\nWe were warned that we were taking on too much at once. But all of the services we offer are necessary in concert with one another. You can\u2019t develop good social content without a design team. You can\u2019t offer good digital consultancy and build websites without an engineering staff. You can\u2019t properly amplify good creative without media buying that accounts for how social platform algorithms prioritize content. We have slowly built out tools like Social Press Kit, AmpLive and FitCause that we have effectively leveraged in establishing value for prospective clients. We\u2019re not just developing creative campaigns \u2014 we\u2019re developing new methods of delivering the campaigns.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so cavalier to presume I have blanket advice that would serve CEOs of varying businesses equally well \u2014 there are so many nuances to each individual business. But I do believe there are essential elements to empowering employees in a creative endeavor. Employees have to be presented with an environment that is conducive to creative pursuit, a physical and mental environment that makes them comfortable. Not too comfortable though\u2026because complacency is dangerous. It\u2019s a delicate balance.\n\nBut the number one thing I focus on is the composition of the team. As a creative agency, we are functionally a sum of creative people applying our talents to problem solving and opportunity seizing for clients. The diversity of thought process amongst staff is extraordinarily important. The manner in which employees are drawn to and respect one another is extraordinarily important. We have to constantly offer growth and empowerment initiatives both in office and outside of work. As we grow in year nine, we\u2019re keenly aware of stresses to the cultural fabric and how individual needs can, if improperly cared for, fracture the sanctity of what we\u2019ve built. We spend more money each year on refining and supporting a healthy company culture than anything else.\n\nThe list of people towards whom I\u2019m grateful is far too long to succinctly enumerate. My parents and my business partners certainly serve as obvious recipients of my endless gratitude. They are the pillars of influence that have enabled Brand Knew\u2019s growth. But beyond that, there have been two people I\u2019ve randomly met through business that have had a profound impact on Brand Knew over the years. Like all businesses that sustain, we\u2019ve had our fair share of luck. And these two individuals are thought leaders who have made career-changing introductions for us, that have throttled our growth. Their initials are EZ and ST. One actually introduced us to the other. We named a conference room in our offices after them\u2026\u201cEasy Street.\u201d With friends like them, we\u2019ve been presented with some great opportunities.\n\nI\u2019m of the school of thought that you\u2019ve got no business living if you don\u2019t intend to leave the planet better than you found it. Our client roster is nearly half non-profit organizations. And there are thousands of non-profits that use a Brand Knew platform like Social Press Kit. I spend a great deal of time learning from NPO founders about different issues (cancer, homelessness, recidivism, big game hunting, ocean pollution, the foster care system, lack of access to clean water, youth education, the proliferation of harmful chemicals in everyday products, etc). It\u2019s made me realize that every able-bodied person has a responsibility to choose a cause to be passionate about and dedicate ample time to said issue. It\u2019s been difficult for me to focus on a single issue, so I\u2019ve tried to leverage my resources towards helping as many causes as possible. And I sit on the boards of several of these organizations.\n\nWe keep \u2018quote cards\u2019 in the office, so whenever someone is looking for inspiration, they can shuffle through the deck. And the quotes don\u2019t always come from expected sources. One of my recent favorites is, \u201cBad things don\u2019t happen to you. They happen for you.\u201d I think it may be attributed to Oprah. It simply alludes to the importance of perspective. Chris Rock also has one of my favorite quotes of the year, \u201cPressure makes diamonds, not hugs.\u201d This speaks so astutely to a competitive environment.\n\nI\u2019d spin the question a bit and request a full day of meals with interesting people.\n\nNote to our readers: If you appreciated this interview, please click on one of the buttons on the top left to post to your twitter, facebook or pinterest.

        "text": "Show me the money framework for improving decision making skills\n\n2017 was the year I agonised over buying a Tesla Model X. I ran through all the reasons I needed it \u2014 beautiful, gorgeous, drives fantastic, best technology and green. I just couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion, because the price was a serious consideration. The problem at hand was that the reasons I wanted to buy it were intangibles.\n\nThat brings us to a key component in decision making \u2014 what do you do when you are facing a decision and there are numerous intangibles at hand? Paraphrasing Lord Kelvin, the famous British physicist, \u201cThe challenge of intangibles \u2014 when you can measure something and express something in numbers, you know what you are speaking about. If you cannot speak about it in numbers, then the knowledge is meager and you have scarcely advanced the state of science.\u201d\n\nAs I looked around in other areas of my life, I saw that there were a number of other decisions that I couldn\u2019t make progress on. They were also stuck because of intangibles. Some good examples that come to mind in the life of a product manager are: the value of open source software, when your product is driven by OSS; the value of adoption of open source software; what does virality mean for success of a product \u2014 how much should we be investing in virality; how to choose between competing features to make the most impact for the organization. I could talk to these decisions very well, had anecdotal evidence and experts backing those decisions\u2026but they fundamentally were intangibles.\n\nI have always been fascinated by literature on decision making and find that most recommendations range from \u201cJust do it\u201d to mind-numbing, if-then-else analysis. Douglas Hubbard presents a scientific, probability-based framework to reduce uncertainty through your decision making progress.\n\nParaphrasing Hubbard, \u201cDecisions fundamentally are about a choice in the path ahead where decision makers have imperfect information. This lack of information causes uncertainty. Measurement is a type of choice among others to reduce this uncertainty. For any decision, you can typically measure a large combination of things, but you can never achieve perfect certainty.\u201d\n\nThus, the right way to think about decisions is that a decision is a decision because one cannot articulate the right value of each of the choices ahead. The way to reduce the uncertainty, then, is to measure the things that reduce that uncertainty, knowing fully well that you cannot \u2014 and should not \u2014 measure everything that informs the decision, because too much information causes information overload. The key part of measurement is to assign an economic value to the measurement. Let\u2019s say, you as a decision maker are looking to improve delivery of value from the organization. Measuring productivity of employees could be a type of measurement, and instead of measuring how much time an employee spends on each of the activities, quantify the business value of each of the areas she spends most of her hours on. Thus, if you get the employee to spend more time on activities that drive more business value, you can get more productivity from the system.\n\nSo how does one proceed, so that one isn\u2019t stuck at the end of a spectrum that has \u201cjust do it\u201d as the starting point and \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d as the ending point?\n\nThe ladder of better decision making starts by stepping back and questioning the decision. Check if you are asking the right question. Most hard problems in life and business can be solved by asking the right questions. If you are indeed asking the right question, then do the following (Hubbard calls it Applied Information Economics; with some color from my past readings on this topic).\n\nTypically, as you do steps 3, 4 and 5, you will find that each decision opens a cascade of micro-decisions that may have their own measurements to help build the case for the overarching decisions that you will rinse and repeat on.\n\nSo how did this framework help me?\n\nWhat decision frameworks work for you? Let me know in the comments section, below."

        "title": "17 Ways to Be Happier At Work \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "17 Ways to Be Happier At Work\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that being happy is one of the things I\u2019ve failed to do consistently throughout my professional career.\n\nSince I began working full-time, my agenda in business was to push myself further along the road to perceived success. Things like what I was earning, what title I had, and how my resume was being shaped were the primary measuring sticks of what I deemed \u201cworth my time.\u201d\n\nHowever, with these checkpoints charting the course for me, I was always left feeling empty. Like something was missing. Never truly fulfilled or proud of my profession apart from when a pay increase or title change was recently enacted.\n\nHere are 17 things that shifted my state from discontent to serenity:\n\nAs we receive recognition, we unconsciously set an expectation for when it\u2019s going to occur again. Unfortunately, it\u2019s rarely forecasted correctly \u2014 leaving us frustrated by our own accomplishments. If you\u2019re brutally honest with yourself however, you\u2019ll realize that the only opinion that matters regarding your performance is your own, as you\u2019re the only one who can affect your performance. Stop holding your breath for applause and go create it for someone else. You\u2019ll find that it feels even better.\n\nWe sometimes get sucked into believing it\u2019s simply a financial trade between employee and employer. But it\u2019s more than just getting paid \u2014 it\u2019s about building personal equity. Your dreams won\u2019t be fulfilled by a few thousand dollars. They\u2019ll only come to fruition by becoming who you always thought you could be.\n\nHave a good friend at the office that you\u2019re able to cut up with daily? Maybe you have the freedom of autonomous decision-making or creation. Whatever it is, don\u2019t gloss over what\u2019s priceless. Against the illusions of fantasy that a \u201cdream job\u201d may impress upon us, the underpinned luxuries get stepped on like a freshly bloomed flower. Wake up and smell the roses.\n\nFeeling good about the work you\u2019re doing often has to do with a stamp of approval. Instead of waiting for a monthly or quarterly meeting, proactively communicate what you\u2019re working on, the progress you\u2019re seeing, and what you intend to tackle next. You\u2019ll feel a lot better once you release your status and intent \u2014 as opposed to anxiously awaiting when you\u2019ll get the platform to showcase your value.\n\nThe problem with comparing your performance to others is you never really know how much better you\u2019re becoming. With most companies moving toward a year-over-year or same-store sales focus, your best checkpoint for growth is your prior results. You\u2019re making a far bigger impact finishing 5th and growing 30% than finishing first and growing 15%.\n\nAs a former perpetual worrier, I know how crippling it is to constantly be concerned with where you stand. I often created all these wild scenarios where my superiors were questioning how suitable I was for my role and none of it was actually happening. All that was happening was I was robbing myself of pride and enjoyment in my work.\n\nAt some point, you\u2019ve got to let go of the vine and let your best be what it\u2019s meant to be.\n\nUnless you work remotely, you probably interact with people on a daily basis. Within the realm of this gift, you can make your work more meaningful by deciding what you\u2019re going to stand for with your co-workers. As you head into the office, choose something to embody that everyone you come in contact with will feel. And with each person, your commitment \u2014 honesty, support, sincerity, appreciation, love \u2014 shows up.\n\nMost the companies you rely on daily to fulfill your needs, like Google and Amazon, started small and were committed to the long haul. As Tony Robbins says, \u201cMost people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade.\u201d Dream as big as you can, but give yourself ample space and time to mold your masterpiece.\n\nBy focusing on others and not ourselves, we give ourselves a break from our own minds. We stay in reality instead of reciting an internal narrative about what we perceive is going on with work. The act of simply offering to assist someone else is often met with openness, appreciation and a little bit of surprise \u2014 all precursors to the ever-elusive state of happiness.\n\nPayroll is most companies\u2019 largest expense. So unless there\u2019s a gap between what\u2019s trending and what the benchmark is, you probably won\u2019t be getting the raise you feel you desperately deserve. Moreover, base pay rate increases often don\u2019t have lasting effects and you\u2019ll soon be focused on what\u2019s next. Where you\u2019ll be far more successful is leveraging incentive plans that pay you out as you exceed certain budgets or metrics. Hang around this arena when negotiating your compensation and find something more gratifying to chase.\n\nIf we\u2019re not careful, our minds can lead us to believe all kinds of wild banter about our jobs and what we should be doing in life. The second something happens that we feel shouldn\u2019t be happening, our minds blow it of proportion. Staying present to the tricks we play on ourselves that sabotage our happiness is just as important as happiness ensuing in the first place.\n\nThe subject of your daily chatter at the office can actually dictate how invested you feel in your work. Surface-level conversations breed surface-level results. Dive deeper into your discussions (even at lunch when you don\u2019t have to) and you\u2019ll experience a rising level of fulfillment.\n\nIn many businesses, a lot can go wrong in the span of a day. Blown sales, lost accounts, pissed off customers \u2014 it\u2019s always something, isn\u2019t it? Given this reality, we must stay disciplined in the acknowledgement of the minor wins, however small they may appear. This is not to compare with or put in place of a major roadblock; it\u2019s simply to continue charting progress. One meaningful conversation can change someone\u2019s day \u2014 hell, even their career. Seek these defining moments in the midst of adversity and offset the despair you\u2019ll otherwise create for yourself.\n\nIn physical fitness, we grow our muscular system stronger by deliberately tearing it down and building it back up. When it comes to our professional growth, the tear-downs are often dropped at our doorstep. The difference is in if we view it as a setback from us being comfortable or an opportunity to grow stronger.\n\nAs a cognitive function of our brain, we like to have everything buttoned-up with our work or we end up taking it home with us. Giving up this idealized sense of closure is critical to realizing your true happiness in your business. There will always be an outstanding issue, a disgruntled employee, a detracting customer. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do anything about it but address it during office hours. Get comfortable not knowing what\u2019s going to happen and give yourself credit for your prior experience with adversity.\n\nWho you are is not what you do. The more we identify with our work, the more fixed we feel within our identities. While that certainty may feel empowering for a period of time, you\u2019ll eventually begin feeling trapped. Take up activities and interests beyond your primary means of income. You\u2019ll diversify your portfolio as a person and leave the door open to all kinds of interesting possibilities for the future.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve just created a one-man start-up in your garage (applause), you probably have some very wise minds around you. Don\u2019t sit back and miss the opportunity to learn what took them years to understand in a matter of minutes. Ask questions, learn best practices and gain valuable insight. And don\u2019t just limit your inquiry to the CEO, President or Board of Directors. Anyone that\u2019s performed well for a substantial amount of time did so with a reason .\n\nFind out what it is."

        "text": "How to take on the day \u2014 maximize your motivation with your morning routine\n\nMotivation is one of the driving forces behind the success of the human race. Instead of remaining a hunter-gatherer race, we decided to breach beyond the limitations of what was possible in the pursuit of something better.\n\nToday\u2019s people are inertly no different than those of the past. Despite the astounding cultural differences, we share one key common similarity \u2014 goals \u2014 the sole reason behind the need for motivation.\n\nEvery person on the planet \u2014 regardless of age, race, gender, wealth \u2014 has goals. Like a snowflake a goal is unique to the person who creates it.\n\nGoals vastly differ in the amounts of dedication, time, and resources it takes to complete them. Most goals are minor, and take hours to complete, with little to no long term dedication and commitment.\n\nA few goals, however, qualify as major goals. These are the goals that we deem are important enough to commit the majority of our time and commitment. These are the goals, that, when accomplished, are the ones that we are remembered by.\n\nIt is these goals that we will focus on today.\n\nMany people who pursue long term goals give up sleep, recreation, and even meals daily to work on their dreams. They\u2019ve decided that this goal is important enough to risk their health and well being.\n\nAll of us at one point or another struggle with staying motivated and on task to accomplish these goals, despite their extreme importance to the legacy we leave behind. This brings forth the problem of motivation, which seems to escape us when we need it the most.\n\nOne of the keys aspects to accomplishing your goals is to learn to maximize your motivation. Although motivation is hard to control, it can be directed and maximized simply by how you start your day.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been reading self development articles for a while, you\u2019ve probably heard about the morning routine, and maybe you\u2019ve even implemented one for yourself. If you haven\u2019t, I wrote an article about my morning routine about two months ago, so please be sure to check it out.\n\nThe purpose of the morning routine is kept abstract for good reason. Most people use this time to work on, many use it to exercise, some use it to learn new things, and some use it just to relax before the rush of the workday starts.\n\nDespite this flexibility, there are a few key practices that you should follow when implementing a morning routine, but we\u2019ll focus on four for right now that will improve your motivation tremendously.\n\nThis is considered to be one of the most influential productivity and self improvement practices ever to be developed. Although most consider meditation to be \u2018for the monks\u2019 many successful entrepreneurs and celebrities, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, utilize it for clearer thinking and relieving tension.\n\nThere are a variety of benefits to meditation, all of which can be applied to motivation. Establishing a clear and developed mindset immediately after waking up is one of the most important.\n\nHumans revolve around sleep cycles, usually in shifts of an hour and a half or so. Left undisturbed, people will naturally wake up at the end of one of these cycles. If we are woken up by external means (such as an alarm) in the middle of one of these sleep cycles, we feel groggy and tired.\n\nWhen we wake up unbalanced, we naturally desire to feel balanced again. In the case of sleep, we wish to complete unfinished sleep cycles. This often results in excessive alarm snoozing, which inhibits how much time you get to work. Even if you are able to pull yourself out of bed, this desire will affect the quality of your work and the motivation to actually pursue your goals.\n\nMeditation is the key to regaining this balance. Instead of immediately rushing to work, spend about five to ten minutes meditating to balance yourself. It\u2019s great to take a reset at the beginning of each day, so that you can prepare yourself for the day ahead.\n\nNot only that, but the clear thinking will increase the quality of the work you perform in the mornings. The higher quality of work will maximize your results, and in turn will further maximize your motivation.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard how important planning is to accomplishing your goals, but this is particularly important to maximizing your motivation.\n\nWhen people commit themselves to goals, they devote the majority of their free time to accomplishing their goals\u2014 time that they could be using to relax and unwind from work or school.\n\nThe commitment of the majority of their \u201cdown time\u201d comes with the expectations of results almost instantaneously. This, of course, is not the case. Most goals with results take months, years, even decades to see real results.\n\nThe very thought of committing years of your life to the pursuit of a single goal is discouraging, to say the least. So why would we?\n\nIt\u2019s easier to comprehend smaller things, like homework assignments, or smaller lengths of time, like a week or even a day.\n\nInstead of having to think about losing 30 pounds, why not think about losing 5 pounds pounds first?\n\nInstead of having to think about finishing a website, why not think about finishing the landing page first?\n\nIt\u2019s a lot less intimidating to think about. By breaking these long term, big projects down, we make it easier to motivate ourselves to progress forward and work on our goals.\n\nThe execution is rather simple as well. After you\u2019ve meditated in the morning, pour yourself a hot beverage (like tea, coffee, or hot water), and set aside 10 to 15 minutes to plan and break down your day. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nDo yourself a favor \u2014 take the weight of the world off of your shoulders and move one step at a time. Not only is it easier, but you\u2019ll be far more motivated at the end of day.\n\nThis will depend on you \u2014 some people like to work out in the evening, and some people like to work out in the morning (I work out in the evening myself). There are different benefits to both, but for now, we\u2019ll talk about how it applies to your morning routine and what it does for your motivation.\n\nI got this recommendation from a friend when I was starting to develop my own morning routine. The first, and maybe the most important benefit, is that working out in the morning pumps your body with energy first thing in the morning. A good workout is guaranteed to wake you up and motivate you for the day ahead.\n\nAnother added benefit of a morning workout is fasted cardio. Not only does a morning workout fill you with energy, it\u2019s also guaranteed to burn the most calories. The way it works is that you eat all of your meals within 8 hours of the day, and then fast for the next 16 hours. The workout happens at the end of the 16 hours, and results in the most calorie loss. If you\u2019re trying to lose weight and tone down, this is a useful trick to implement.\n\nExercise is actually one of the best practices that any person can implement, and its guaranteed to improve every aspect of your life. Your energy skyrockets and your overall mood shifts dramatically, and in turn, your motivation goes through the roof.\n\nThis probably comes as no surprise. Now that you\u2019ve planned, exercised, and meditated, you\u2019re ready to take on the day. If you have a goal, the last hour or two is the prime time to work on it. This is the point in time where your motivation, mood, and energy are at their absolute peak. Read a book, learn a new skill, work on a side project \u2014 whatever activity excites you, whatever goal urges you on, this is the best time to complete it.\n\nNow go for it.\n\nThank you all so much for reading!

        "text": "For many of us, our job title defines us. \n\nIt is how we value one another. It\u2019s how we earn respect.\n\nThere are certain jobs we value more than others.\n\nFor example, what would you think of me if I said I was a musician? Or a writer? And what if I said I was a founder of a music label and a creative production business? Would it change how you value me?\n\nThe truth is \u2014 anyone can make themselves a founder or CEO of something. \n\nI might be an executive of a large corporate, but a terrible human being.\n\nIs this really the best way to judge someone?\n\nToday, it is not politically correct to judge someone by their sex, race, or skin color, but we still have to make a quick assessment when we meet someone. \n\nIt is only natural. Do they pose a danger? Are they worth looking up to?\n\nSome professions earn more respect than others because they require years of studying and practicing. You probably thought of doctors. \n\nBut is it not only doctors who study for years. I have studied music for over 10 years before I considered myself a professional. Hours and hours every week.

        "title": "5 Stunning VR Marketing Campaigns That Will Inspire Your Next Business Idea",
        "text": "The truth is that most marketing and promotion doesn\u2019t work if it isn\u2019t stunning or original.\n\nTake paid display ads, for instance: only 0.6% of us will actually click on them (and that\u2019s according to Google, who has a lot of skin in the game). And when it comes to sponsor content, I know I\u2019m not the only one who keeps on scrolling. Simply put, most ads are played out, and we\u2019d rather stare at a brick wall or a muted screen than be barraged by them.\n\nOn the other hand, creative ads that manage to stand out can be wildly effective \u2014 like the last SuperBowl\u2019s Tide Ad which had the internet raving.\n\nI\u2019ve written about how VR is very likely to revolutionize marketing, so, in this article, I\u2019d like to share some great campaigns that will inspire you to create ads that deliver. (Even if you aren\u2019t using VR yet, there are some takeaways and plenty of inspiration ahead.)\n\nVirtual reality is a stunning way to tell (and experience) stories. However, there\u2019s plenty of people who don\u2019t own VR equipment, or assume it\u2019s insanely expensive to buy.\n\nThe New York Times, which produces breathtaking VR journalism, solved the issue by shipping Google Cardboard goggles (try saying that 5 times fast) to its subscribers. The cardboard product (which costs around $10) allowed anyone to see the NYT\u2019s VR through their smartphone, and it greatly boosted the demand and audience for their VR journalism.\n\nNYT\u2019s brilliant idea just goes to show the major impact that a convenient delivery of emotions can have for your business.\n\nVR is making splashes in the art world, and it\u2019s not limited to the art itself.\n\nLook no further than The KAUST Museum. Since it\u2019s located in Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s quite a trek for me to visit (along with other Americans). Fortunately, if you aren\u2019t able to make the flight, you can get your hands on their \u201cViewseum\u201d \u2014 an all-in-one VR kit that lets you explore the museum from your couch. Even better, those who visited the museums and bought the product as a gift became ambassadors and advocates for the museum.\n\nTakeaway: Even if you aren\u2019t doing VR, consider a giveaway that\u2019s tied to your brand \u2014 it will transform your customers into evangelists.\n\nMost of us want to drive, feel and experience a car first-hand before buying it. However, if you\u2019re anything like me, you also don\u2019t want to spend your limited spare time dealing with car salespeople.\n\nLook no further than Volvo\u2019s recent campaign, which allows you to \u201cdrive\u201d the car using your smartphone and Google Carboard. When they used it for their Volvo V40 model, it sold out within just 2 days.\n\nIcons (the smell, taste, or general experiences) behind your brand have been proven to strongly drive purchasing decisions. Think: the smell of McDonald\u2019s fries. If you can find a way to deliver this to customers, you\u2019ll have a million-dollar idea.\n\nTOMS is famous for its mission to match customers\u2019 shoe purchases with a giveaway to a child in need. It\u2019s not only just plain good for humanity, but also a strong emotional marketing tool. They supercharged the impact on both sides by rolling out VR experiences that actually showed where the matched shoe pairs went, and how they helped local communities.\n\nTOMS founder Blake Mycoskie said this delivered troves of positive acclaim from customers, and that it would play a big role in the communication going forward.\n\nAs Vrse\u2019s Chris Milk explained in his TED Talk, VR can be the \u201cultimate empathy machine.\u201d And empathy (when used ethically and correctly) is one of the ultimate marketing and business tools. If you don\u2019t have a meaning, story, and mission behind your brand, who is going to care?\n\nWe\u2019re living an experience economy \u2014 where people value events and sharing them (even more than the products themselves). So it\u2019s no small wonder that VR is being used as a powerful tool to sell through this method.\n\nBritish Columbia took advantage by allowing potential tourists to experience their natural wonders from home in an immersive way (and share the experience with friends). And it skyrocketed tourism as a result. Check it out for yourself here.\n\nWant to supercharge your business? Create a similar experience that bridges the gap between apprehension and buying through an immersive and emotional tool.\n\nThe bottom line: These examples go to show that creative and emotional marketing can have a major impact. When it comes to marketing yourself, don\u2019t be afraid to step outside the box; the results might amaze you.\n\nLearn more about VR and marketing at LTProject.com.

        "title": "SEREY: an exciting Social Media platform on the blockchain in Cambodia",
        "text": "There is a new Social Media platform that specifically targets the Cambodian market. The country that saw nearly a quarter of the population decimated during the civil war of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, the Khmer rouge regime, and the subsequent famine, is quickly rising. Accompanied by its astounding economic development of the past two decades, the country has clearly shrugged off its troubled past and is eagerly looking to a bright future. Accompanying its development also comes adoption of new technologies.\n\nOne such technology is blockchain. It is now adopted by the Serey team for their social media platform where content creators like writers and singers are rewarded for publishing their content. The Serey platform is recently live, and already has many users writing content ranging from fictional short stories to cryptocurrencies, self-made beauty products, and culture. The system is based on a democratic voting system in which every user can vote on articles. Dependent on the number of votes and who have given the votes, content creators are rewarded with the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency called Serey coins (SRY).\n\nThe founders of Serey are two Cambodian brothers who were born in a Cambodian refugee camp called Khao I Dang which is on the Thai-Cambodian border. During the Khmer rouge period of 1975\u20131978, their parents fled the country and ended up in the camp. For a more detailed recollection of life in the camp, one of the founders\u2019 memoires of the camp has been published by the Foundation of Economic Education which is located in the United States.\n\nIn 1991, at the age of around 5\u20136 years, the founders were granted residentship in the Netherlands. They have been educated in Economics (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and Philosophy (Macau and Dublin, Ireland). Influenced by the philosophy of classical liberalism and Friedrich Hayek\u2019s theory of dispersed knowledge, the two founders have sought for ways to utilize blockchain technology to create a platform where people can express their creativity in Cambodia, share knowledge, and engage in thoughtful, civilized discussions. At this moment, there is no such online platform yet. The founders are hopeful that one day the Serey platform will be seen as the testimony that Cambodia is full of talented and vibrant people.\n\nSerey aims at becoming a premier Social Media platform where people can express their creativity freely. Realizing that every individual knows just a fraction of what is collectively known and that the nature of our collective knowledge is therefore inherently decentralized, Serey would like to encourage sharing of the unique information that individuals possess through the Serey platform.\n\nIn short, Serey wants to create an open platform where everyone is free to enter, no matter what their station of birth, race or economic power is. It is a place where anyone, anywhere may exercise their creativity without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Where users share fun and interesting content with each other, while making friends.\n\nThe Serey mission can therefore be summarized as:\n\nTraditional Social Media like for example Facebook and Twitter have generated billions of dollars for their shareholders by taking users\u2019 content and selling it to advertisers. Instead of channeling value to a small group of shareholders, the participants of the Serey platform are rewarded for their writing. Hence, value flows to those that provide content.\n\nThe very first moment you join www.serey.io, you are offered a small amount of Serey which gives your voice a weight in determining what content should be rewarded.\n\nSerey is principally a fork of Steemit \u2014 another social media platform on the blockchain \u2014 and therefore essentially makes use of the Graphene technology behind Steemit and Bitshares. However, where Steemit is trying to conquer the world, Serey is entirely dedicated to the people of Cambodia. Serey believes that regional differences require different user interfaces, and specific functionalities that match the people\u2019s cultural makeup and their level of sophistication with blockchain technology. The Serey team have therefore chosen to create a platform with:\n\n1) A brand new layout\n\n2) A market place section\n\n3) A Khmer language option\n\n4) An advertisement section\n\n5) A simplification of the reward system\n\nIn addition to the above changes, Serey will release a Serey Decentralized Exchange (Serey DEX)which is currently being set up in cooperation with developers close to Bitshares and Steemit. It will be a full-fledged decentralized exchange accessible by anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nNext to the Serey coins (SRY), the exchange will have the most important cryptocurrencies listed like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash and also such national currency digital assets like bitUSD, bitEUR and bitCNY. With the Serey DEX, Cambodian people will have an interesting cryptocurrency trading platform to look forward to. It will be available in English and in Khmer \u2014 the native language of the Cambodian people. Currently, there is not one local cryptocurrency exchange in Cambodia yet.\n\nOther features\n\nOther exciting features on Serey to look forward to this year are an online betting system, improvements of the market place section, and an integrated chat similar to that of Facebook.\n\nThe Serey team has a partnership with the highly regarded USA based blockchain consulting and development service, Blocksimple, which has experience developing blockchain projects in the USA, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Ukraine. Next to consultation on the development of the Serey platform, Blocksimple has also developed its pre-sale website, and continues to be an important partner for Serey.\n\nSerey has released their whitepaper publically, which you can find here.\n\nCurrently, Serey is going through a pre-sale. There are 100 million initial Serey coins created of which 55 million is sold to the public at the starting price of $0.015 and gradually moving up to $0.020. The team is hoping to raise at least $500,000 which will give them enough breathing room to develop the platform for the next 5 years.\n\nIn addition to a rise in the price of one SRY, investors can also benefit from (1) receiving interest on the coins due to its Delegated Proof of Stake system and from (2) an increased weight of their voting power when they upvote articles on the Serey platform. This means that they have more influence on the distribution of rewards to articles.\n\nIn order to take part in the pre-sale, one should make an account on www.serey.io first.\n\nA link to the pre-sale website is www.sale.serey.io, and the payment methods are BTC, ETH and LTC. More information on the pre-sale can be found in the whitepaper (pp. 14\u201315).\n\nIf you have any questions, you can reach the team through:"

        "text": "How My Friend Became Rich And Famous\n\n\u201c\u0093Business is a good game, lots of competition and a minimum of rules. You keep score with money.\u0094\u201d \u2014 Nolan Bushnell (Atari founder)\n\nI wish you could know my friend BM. He might inspire you. He certainly inspires me.\n\nI\u0092\u2019m sure you would like him. He\u0092\u2019s very nice, very self-effacing. If you met him in a bar, you\u0092d never guess he was so successful. And it\u0092\u2019s not just his millions. He has a great life. Everybody everywhere seems to know and like him.\n\nIt all comes from the way he\u0092s structured his life. And that\u0092\u2019s what I want to tell you about today.\n\nBM loves what he does. He loves his business, his home, his cars, and virtually everyone he meets. His first response to everything and everybody is positive.\n\nSome might say that\u0092\u2019s his nature, but I know BM better. He has as many doubts and worries as the rest of us. And he\u2019\u0092s certainly had as many challenges. He grew up with a big family in a small house on a very mean street in Manchester, England. When he was in his early teens, he saw his little brother die in an accident with a street trolley. Then it got worse.\n\nBut he had one thing going for him. He was taught by his father that it is impolite to feel sorry for yourself. And he took that message to heart. You will never hear BM complain about the difficulties in his life. He\u0092\u2019d much rather find something to laugh about.\n\nThere\u2019\u0092s another thing about BM. He thinks work is fun. And he shows that by working all the time and making it seem like fun to those around him. This quality has fueled his business.\n\nAdd to that two solid business instincts. He likes to sell what people like to buy. And he likes to undersell his competitors.\n\nI first met BM about 15 years ago. He had just come to America and opened up a little furniture store on a side street in Boca Raton, Florida. I had been looking to buy an antique-looking pine chest. I had shopped around but couldn't find one in my price range. BM had one \u0096at half the price I\u2019\u0092d seen it for elsewhere.\n\n\u0093How can you afford to sell it so cheaply?\u0094 I asked him.\n\n\u201c\u0093I have my tricks\u201d\u0094 he said, smiling.\n\nI got the chest home, and it didn't\u0092 fit. I called him up, wondering if I was going to get a hard time. Not only was he happy to take it back, he said he\u2019\u0092d send someone by the next day so I wouldn't\u0092 have to go to the trouble of hauling it back to his shop.\n\nNeedless to say, I have been buying furniture from him ever since.\n\nI did eventually discover how he was able to sell his furniture so cheaply. He has relatives and friends in England who are in the business of taking old wood and manufacturing it to look like antique furniture.\n\nBM was the first furniture salesman in Florida to recognize the beginning of what turned out to be a huge trend in country-pine furniture. He not only foresaw the rising demand, but also figured out a way to underprice his competition.\n\nTen years later, he was the leader in an industry of a hundred knock-offs. His business had grown quickly because he sold into a growing trend with advantageous pricing.\n\nIn recent years, he\u0092\u2019s been able to successfully introduce several high-end lines of furniture, including real antiques that happily I (and some of his other earlier customers) can now afford.\n\nBut his main business is still selling popular knock-offs at greatly reduced prices. He does it honestly and with good humor, and his customers appreciate it. He doesn't\u0092 have the snob appeal that some higher-priced retailers might enjoy, but he has something better \u2014 hundreds of very loyal and increasingly wealthy customers.\n\nJust the other day, BM told me he was going to open up a new operation at High Point in North Carolina. (It\u0092\u2019s the site of one of America\u0092s biggest wholesale furniture exhibitions.)\n\nFor years, he had gone there simply to buy. But the market has become so strong that he couldn't\u0092 resist putting in his own store.\n\nThe competition is severe. There are dozens of operators selling the same stuff he\u0092\u2019s selling, and they have been there for years.\n\n\u201c\u0093So what are you going to do to distinguish yourself?\u201d\u0094 I asked. \u0093\u201dAre you going to specialize in some way?\u0094\u201d\n\n\u201c\u0093I\u0092\u2019m going to sell all the popular stuff,\u201d\u0094 he said.\n\nHis plan is to mark up his product by 60% \u0096(a very narrow margin for this type of business). Most of his competitors have 250% to 300% mark ups.\n\n\u201c\u0093How do your competitors up there feel about it?\u201d\u0094 I wanted to know.\n\n\u0093\u201cOh, I don\u2019\u0092t think they\u0092\u2019re thrilled,\u201d\u0094 he said. \u0093\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019\u0092ll live with it. They seem to like me.\u201d"

        "title": "GDPR in Blockchain: Which of the Following Is True About Privacy?",
        "text": "GDPR in Blockchain: Which of the Following Is True About Privacy?\n\nThe scandal around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook has made us consider data protection more seriously than ever. And along with following the news, we\u2019re waiting for the month of May and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) coming into force. The new regulations spiced up with the blockchain technology will influence our ideas about data security in general. But the mix of these phenomena need to be explained in more detail \u2014 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\n\nWhat problems GDPR solves and how blockchain becomes the one and only solution for some issues \u2014 this is the subject of the today\u2019s conversation.\n\nBefore discussing GDPR as a new concept concerning personal data protection, let\u2019s revise some basics of the blockchain technology. The thing is some areas of blockchain are affected a lot by new regulations, and we will describe them one by one.\n\nDealing with blockchain, you can transform data through hashing and encryption. So, hashing is a one-way data transformation when a piece of information becomes unreadable (it is called a hashed value). Encryption offers users a two-way data transformation. In this case, you need a special key to make information unreadable. This same key is used to decrypt the piece of data.\n\nImmutable transactions are a type of transactions that can\u2019t be changed when they are written on the blockchain. The information can\u2019t be deleted because in this way you \u201cbreak the chain\u201d which destroys the foundation of the blockchain.\n\nTransparency of blockchain is backed by an opportunity for users to look through the history of all cryptocurrency transactions. This huge amount of data becomes public and accessible for everyone (public blockchain). There is also a certain scheme to provide transparency for private (permissioned) blockchains.\n\nAlthough most of the conversations are around permissioned blockchains, data protection trends are connected with public blockchains too. So, let\u2019s move forward to the GDPR part of this talk.\n\nGDPR follows certain rules. But before learning them, let\u2019s review the basic framework of the upcoming changes.\n\nFirst of all, there are two main concepts that GDPR aims to improve:\n\nThe primary thing. People talk a lot about the new laws, but strictly speaking, there is no big shock for the global community. The important thing is, it emphasizes the importance of rights for users and the rules that data processors must abide by. The digital environment will have a legitimate protection for the data usage \u2014 that\u2019s basically what it\u2019s all about.\n\nApplication area. GDPR is broadly applicable. Anyone who deals with personal data of European citizens on day-to-day basis can\u2019t avoid GDPR limitations. Even if your business is located outside the European Union, GDPR is a point of your concern.\n\nYou also should know that substantial fines, which become a consequence of the rule violence, can have a big impact on the company\u2019s work. Hence, all types of companies (not only IT) are in the danger zone.\n\nThe main rules. The GDPR document contains 11 chapters, but there are some important points won\u2019t take much time to read.\n\n1. Access right for everyone. With the new regulation, each individual has the right to know who else has an access to his or her data and which exactly pieces of this data are visible for other users. Besides, everyone now will know how the personal data is used.\n\n2. Right to ask for data deleting. If a person knows that his personal data is used by any third parties, he can ask them to delete this information.\n\n3. Right to transfer the data. It means that any individual has a right to extract data in a certain format. Besides, users can demand data exchange at their request.\n\n4. Right to use the minimum amount of data. This rule concerns third-party organizations \u2014 they can extract and use only the minimum needed amount of data.\n\nApart from the rules, GDPR also sets measures that companies should take to ensure the high-level protection of personal data. It even includes hiring a data protection specialist. But how do these new responsibilities match the blockchain technologies? Let\u2019s look more closely at two of them.\n\nYou could\u2019ve already noticed that some blockchain principles can be well-adjusted to the new GDPR conditions. Here is how new regulations meet new technologies represented by the blockchain.\n\nWe already know that GDPR promotes protections of personal data by all means. At the same time, blockchain allows data transactions without identity disclosure to other parties. Only private and public keys are a personal matter as it is unique for each user. Therefore, anonymity is one of the blockchain features. And in parallel, \u201canonymity\u201d and \u201cpseudonymity\u201d are mentioned in the new rules. \u201cPseudonymity\u201d in terms of data protection means that personal information can\u2019t be ascribed to a specific individual.\n\nWhen we appear on the Internet field, we often don\u2019t have enough trust in the services of Internet providers. But as time goes by, we have to share lots of our personal data with the global web: insurance and medical identities, payments details, tax information, etc.\n\nBlockchain gives users decentralization and cryptographic security, and GDPR aims to increase the customer\u2019s trust engaging financial and government institutions. Consequently, more businesses and individuals will be inclined to embrace opportunities brought by globalization and eCommerce. And as GDPR should be implemented in each EU country (and can\u2019t be changed depending on the territory), small and mid-sized companies will be able to join a global European market with ease.\n\nThe immutability problem. Some of the blockchain features are not an opportunity but rather a limitation for the GDPR progress. For example, the immutability issue we\u2019ve discussed above can be a burden for companies. The thing is the regulation gives people the right to erase and correct the private data. Immutability, at the same time, acts the opposite way.\n\nNo doubt, we expect big changes to come in a month. The anticipation of European companies has reached the highest level and brought up the myriad of controversial discussions. The general overview we\u2019ve made today shows that there is no final verdict whether GDPR and blockchain are a successful duo or not.\n\nBut what we know for sure is that we can expect big changes to come which will transform the blockchain sphere and mix it with the data rules. Nonetheless, regulations are necessary for global economic processes in general and the digital business in particular."

        "text": "As I delve more into freelancing, I am provided with more opportunities to work remotely. I\u2019m not unfamiliar with the concept of remote working and the necessity of self-motivation, having done high school online.\n\nPretty self-explanatory, remote work is when an employee completes work while away from a dedicated company office.\n\nAlso called telecommuting, this doesn\u2019t need to be all or nothing. Employees can work remote anywhere from all of the time, to only on Fridays, to only when the dedicated office is inaccessible. There can be various degrees of remote work with an organization.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve had varying commute lengths. Besides how terrible driving-on my own- everyday, 5 days a week is for the environment, it\u2019s also pretty disheartening to realize how much time you\u2019re spending in the car. If you take public transit and are able to make use of your commute time, it\u2019s not as bad. However, the average person commute time in the United States is 25.4 minutes.\n\nWorking from home, you gain more than just your time back. You also can work in pajamas which, honestly, is reason enough to work remote.\n\nPast being able to work from home, I consistently find I\u2019m far more creative when I switch up my work environment frequently. Whether it\u2019s a coworking space, a coffee shop, or even telecommuting at a data center, the fresh environment inspires me and I\u2019m able to be a lot more productive."

        "text": "I may have considered myself a writer for years, creating poetry and short stories, never feeling anything but joy in the practice of my art.\n\nAnd then I get my first deadline, and it\u2019s a term paper on the most boring subject I could ever imagine, and Idiscover that writing isn\u2019t always the most wonderful activity in the universe.\n\nOften, writing can seem like a chore. And even if I want to write, I might find myself experiencing dreaded \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d. There are ways to defeat it, but that is another story.\n\nWhat do I do to readjust the way I see writing?\n\nDoes writing have to only exist in 2 separate categories: Writing I want to do, and writing I don\u2019t want to do?\n\nNo matter what it is I need to write about, there is almost always a way for me to approach it that makes it mean something to me. It\u2019s up to me to discover that path. Perhaps I need to write a story about the history of tunnels in transportation for an engineering class. On the surface (pun intended) this might seem astoundingly dull to me. But I just need to delve deeper (whoo-hoo, pun two!) and I may be able to find something that makes tunnels exciting. Maybe I am big Elon Musk supporter, and I like the Hyperloop concept. Well, he\u2019s trying to revolutionize tunneling with his Boring Company. There\u2019s my \u201cin\u201d.\n\nWell, it certainly IS a skill. But most people don\u2019t think of it like that. A lot of people who consider themselves writers don\u2019t even think of it like that. Writing is as much an improvable, practicable skill as wood carving, parenting, or playing the cello. It needs to be used and evaluated and grown over time. Yet all too often writing is taken for granted. Just like flying a plane, I can put my writing on autopilot, just coast along on the air currents, and be content with wherever I end up. Or I can take the yoke and actually FLY. It takes years of actual practice to even begin to approach any level of mastery. I take my writing seriously.\n\nBy \u201cactive\u201d, I mean in every sense of the word. Moving and doing are best friends of the writer. Join like minded people in writer\u2019s groups IRL or online. Find people who are excited about the subject I need to write about and get together with them to help me discover new angles from which to approach it. Does my book involve spelunking? Get talking to some spelunkers! Is the Louvre a major location in my novel? Do my best to schedule a trip to Paris. Whatever I can do to involve myself in what my writing is about, I figure out a way to do it.\n\nThere are good habits and bad habits. I look at \u201cnot writing every single day\u201d a bad habit to fall into. So I\u2019ve made a promise to myself that I WILL write every single day, and I do my best to follow through. Some people give themselves a word requirement (300, 500, 1000, more?). That isn\u2019t really the important aspect of this. In fact, there are no strict details to adhere to other than \u201cwrite all the time\u201d. Even if I don\u2019t have a waterproof notepad in my shower stall, I can compose description and dialogue as I scrub-a-dub. As I\u2019m out for my daily 3-mile jog I can dictate words into an app. If I have a particularly tough day and get home at ten minutes to midnight having written nothing, I still have ten minutes to write!\n\nRead more. Nearly everyone needs to read more. And read different things. It is far too easy to get entrenched in one subject or genre and wind up using 80% of my reading time there. But if I focus on widening my scope I will find myself exposed to subject matter, vocabulary, and POVs that expand my mind and broaden my own writer\u2019s toolset.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing!\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you might like:"

        "text": "1. Self-Regulatory Body To Be Launched In Japan\n\nJapanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun has reported that a self-regulatory body is set to be launched in Japan soon: the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association (JCEA). It will consist of the 16 licensed exchanges located in the country. A set of standards and best practices will be jointly created and followed by all members. Exchanges which are not licensed yet (approximately twelve) will also be advised by the group, especially in terms of cross-industry advancements. We first reported on the initiative back in February, where it was acknowledged it would take time.\n\n2. Korean SK Telecom To Improve Its Services With Blockchain\n\nSouth Korea-based SK Telecom plans to use blockchain in its payments and subscriptions process to improve client satisfaction. This will be achieved by creating a \u2018real-name authentication program\u2019. An asset management service is also under development. Customers will be able to trade valuable items on a peer-to-peer level. Financial and non-financial assets, cryptocurrencies included, will all be managed from the same place. Credit cards, bank accounts and mileage points will also be part of the assets which will be grouped in the basket. SK Telecom is also planning the launch of a token exchange hub aimed at helping startups and SMEs interested in ICOs. They would be connected with investors, who would provide capital for growth.\n\n3. One In Five Financial Institutions Plan to Allow Crypto Trading\n\nA survey conducted by Reuters revealed that one in five financial institutions is planning on allowing the trading of cryptocurrencies on its platform in the next 12 months. Out of this group, 70% has the intention of doing so within three to six months. The data was gathered from a pool of 400 Thomson Reuters Corp clients. Among the respondents, there were trading desks, asset managers and hedge funds from the largest banks. Despite regulatory concerns and uncertainty, the number of institutions operating in the industry was expected to grow, and it did so. This was due to higher interest from their clients, and hedge funds\u2019 previous attempts at cryptocurrency trading.\n\n4. Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Says Bitcoin Will Be Bigger Than The Internet\n\nTim Draper was an early investor in Skype, Tesla and Hotmail. The venture capitalist has now stated he believes Bitcoin will be bigger than those companies combined, even bigger than the internet. He shared his thoughts during the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, which involved the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Adam Smith Society. Draper previously affirmed that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by 2022, and has now restated it. He went on to say that the cryptocurrency value will grow due to its expansion into everyday life situations. Draper previously purchased 30,000 coins, back in 2014. Despite them being worth $268 million now, he has no plans to sell them."

        "text": "Peek in my closet and you\u2019ll see a row of identical Lacoste polo shirts in every color of the rainbow. Every morning, I grab a shirt, a pair of jeans, and I\u2019m ready to go. I barely have to open my eyes.\n\nIt seems my \u201clife uniform\u201d also puts me in good company. Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft\u2019s Scott Guthrie, PR maven Kelly Cutrone, and even Barack Obama often sport the same outfit, day after day.\n\nHey, if it\u2019s good enough for Obama, it\u2019s definitely good enough for me \u2014 and science backs us both up.\n\nAs author John Tierney explains, humans are hardwired to feel decision fatigue when we face too many choices:\n\nThe more choices you make throughout the day, says Tierney, the more your brain seeks one of two shortcuts: either you become reckless and act impulsively, or you do nothing at all. You decide not to decide.\n\nAs the founder of JotForm, a company with over 100 employees and 3.5 million users, I can\u2019t afford to make reckless choices, nor do I want to feel paralyzed by indecision. I imagine you feel the same way.\n\nReducing the number of decisions in your day is one way to preserve precious brain power.\n\nCreating systems for life\u2019s less critical choices (like what to eat and wear) also opens more space for the important stuff.\n\nWith light-speed technical changes and limitless information at our fingertips, making smart decisions has never been more important. It\u2019s an essential skill.\n\nGood decision-making can help you to work better, manage stress, avoid burnout, and live a happier and healthier life.\n\nMaking decisions doesn\u2019t seem like something that requires practice.\n\nAfter all, we make them constantly: Do you want chocolate or vanilla? A trip to Italy or Iceland? Will you pick candidate A or B?\n\nThe first choice has low stakes. And both Italy and Iceland are potentially great destinations. But once there\u2019s more on the line, your decisions matter \u2014 a lot.\n\nWe typically see ourselves as logical, rational people who can think through any challenge (and that\u2019s often true), but our minds are far from perfect.\n\nWe are psychologically susceptible to making a whole range of mental errors, from anchoring to confirmation bias to loss aversion.\n\nA recent Business Insider story by Shana Lebowitz and Samantha Lee illustrates a whopping 20 different cognitive biases that prevent us from making accurate, healthy and helpful decisions. There are probably more ways to blur our choices, but this can quickly become a depressing exercise.\n\nInstead, I want to talk about solutions.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to decision fatigue, which is also called choice overload, or its social media-driven cousin, FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\nYou can actually fight the fatigue by settling for good enough. This might feel like blasphemous advice in the 24/7-hustle-and-grind startup world, but it\u2019s a powerful technique.\n\nI also apply this advice to my business.\n\nJotForm plays in a hyper-competitive market where even Google has stepped into the ring.\n\nIt would be easy to get caught up in FOMO, feature-matching and industry trends, but we\u2019ve chosen to stay in our lane and focus deeply on our customers.\n\nWe do our very best for them and that\u2019s good enough \u2014 this decision to focus on the customer (not the competition) also brought us over 1 million new signups in a year.\n\nI don\u2019t worry about hitting the top of TechCrunch, networking in Silicon Valley, or attracting investors to my bootstrapped firm, either.\n\nIt\u2019s not that these aren\u2019t valuable things, or smart goals for other founders, but I make my choices and move on. I\u2019m more than satisfied with my business and my life.\n\nAs the chocolate/vanilla and candidate A/B example highlighted, not all decisions are the same.\n\nSome can be put on autopilot (like what shirt to wear), while others demand real time and attention.\n\nPartnering up (in life and business), hiring employees, and choosing a career path, for example, deserve your cognitive energy.\n\nIn response, you can categorize your choices into small, medium and big decisions. Be playful or systematic with the small ones. Then, apply your best thinking and use your personal values as a guide for the big stuff.\n\nIn a 2017 letter to Amazon shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos said he believes in making \u201chigh-quality, high-velocity decisions.\u201d\n\nThe key, according to Bezos, is to gather just enough information. Aim to have 70% of the data you need instead of a near-certain 90%.\n\nUpstart founder Dave Girouard also calls speed \u201cthe ultimate weapon in business.\u201d He believes that when a decision is made matters more than what decision is made. Choosing quickly is a habit you can develop and strengthen.\n\nBut how do you actually make faster decisions?\n\nGathering a Goldilocks-level of data (not too little, not too much, but just the right amount) is one tactic, but there are other ways to speed up your choices, while still choosing well.\n\nHere are the techniques that my team and I apply on a regular basis.\n\nImagining the worst-case scenario can clarify your choice. This is a technique I learned from the ancient philosophy of Stoicism.\n\nFor example, maybe you\u2019re going to jaywalk across a busy street. Worst case? You could be struck by a car. In this situation, it\u2019s probably worth walking to the marked crossing.\n\nThe key is to visualize major problems before they happen, then work backward to make a strong choice.\n\nIf you\u2019re choosing between two options, which holds greater weight?\n\nDoes one present a higher capacity for success or failure? This isn\u2019t about categorizing decisions; it\u2019s about categorizing choices.\n\nSometimes your choices aren\u2019t created equal. Road A could lead you to a massive profit increase, while road B ultimately has a 10% cap.\n\nThis is also a moment to consider your data. Do you have enough information to make the choice? If not, keep learning \u2014 but stop at Bezos\u2019 optimal 70%.\n\nChess is a game of skill and strategy. Great players not only consider what their opponents might do, but they also imagine all possible paths through the board.\n\nThe same technique can be applied to decision-making.\n\nThink beyond the immediate future to days, weeks, months, and even years down the road. Consider where each choice will lead.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard this advice before, but it persists for a reason. Get out of your head and put your thoughts down on paper.\n\nWrite out the pros and cons. Or do a full brain dump of all your options. List everything that comes to mind. Then, strike out any choices that don\u2019t make sense.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll be left with one smart option. Even if you can whittle the choices down to 2 or 3, you\u2019re making great progress.\n\nWhen you\u2019re facing a tough choice, ask yourself, \u201cwhat\u2019s the smallest possible decision I could make?\u201d\n\nMaybe you\u2019re considering a move to New York, but you\u2019ve never been there before. Don\u2019t make such a big leap. Start with a four-day trip and take it from there.\n\nWe often use the \u201csmall decisions\u201d tactic at JotForm. For example, we\u2019re currently redesigning our homepage. Instead of mocking up 12 options, the team created three new versions that visitors see at random.\n\nWe measure how each new version converts and compare it to our current homepage. Soon we\u2019ll know which design to choose \u2014 or if we should leave it as-is. Easy.\n\nGathering advice can be invaluable. I often talk through big decisions with my team members.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll even pretend that the decision is made in order to gauge their reactions. I know the final choice rests with me, but different perspectives open my eyes.\n\nJust be careful who you consult \u2014 and don\u2019t be swayed into a choice that doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\nNot to get all Zen here, but we only have the present moment. You can think through possibilities, visualize the future, and imagine negative consequences, yet now is what matters.\n\nNow is where you do the work and live your life. Today is your opportunity.\n\nThat\u2019s why every morning, I ask myself:\n\nAre we trying to get better today?\n\nAre we reinventing ourselves?\n\nAre we getting stronger and smarter?\n\nAre we enjoying the work and serving the people who matter?\n\nIf I can answer each question with a solid \u201cyes,\u201d I know we\u2019re making the right decisions. The rest will unfold as it should."

        "text": "When I was growing up, my dad always told me to take the lessons I learned from basketball and apply them to life. It was hard to fathom life after basketball as a kid, so it wasn\u2019t until years later that his words sunk in. One critical lesson I learned from my basketball days was how not to practice.\n\nAs a basketball player looking to improve, I followed the conventional attitude toward skill-building: put in thousands of hours to become really good. I practiced relentlessly on my own, with dreams of playing in college. Years of repetition \u2014 playing up to eight games on a weekend and shooting baskets for hours \u2014 helped to a point.\n\nHowever, my skills plateaued when I was a junior in high school. Frustrated, I poured more time into practice, but that didn\u2019t help. In the end, I played one year of college basketball before deciding to hang up my laces.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t recognize it at the time, my practice approach neglected several critical aspects needed for improvement. I came to this realization a few years later when I decided to become a professional writer, and needed to build my writing skills.\n\nWe all know that skills are important. But what\u2019s rarely addressed is how to build them properly, since most of us go about it all wrong, as I did with basketball. Since the workplace is becoming more skill-based, we need to know how to build skills the right way.\n\nIn his book Peak, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson tells the story of how Benjamin Franklin created exercises to help himself write better. For example, in one exercise Franklin found an article from The Spectator, a British magazine that he admired, and jotted down short descriptions of each sentence. After several days Franklin tried to rewrite the article based on his descriptions.\n\nThen, he compared his version to the original article and made revisions. \u201cThis taught him to express ideas clearly and cogently,\u201d Ericsson concludes. Instead of repeatedly writing articles for the sake of writing articles, he concentrated on one aspect of writing, using The Spectator for feedback. This practice inspired more exercises to improve other aspects of his craft.\n\nFranklin\u2019s practice method underscores several essential elements of deliberate practice \u2014 a term Ericsson uses to describe the type of practice needed to develop expertise. Deliberate practice is all about skill development. It\u2019s a fully-focused, conscious effort that takes you out of your \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d centers on a specific goal, and \u201cdemands near-maximal effort.\u201d In other words, you\u2019re not going through the motions doing something that comes easy or natural. \u201cThe hallmark of . . . deliberate practice,\u201d Ericsson writes, \u201cis that you try to do something you cannot do.\u201d\n\nFeedback is critical to deliberate practice, so you can learn from and correct your errors. For Franklin, feedback came from comparing his version of the article to the original. A contemporary example is artist Kate Leigh Cutler, who regularly participates in art critiques. It\u2019s a practice the New Jersey-based artist has been doing for some twenty-five years. \u201cCritiques are important because that\u2019s how I learn,\u201d she says.\n\nResearch on doctors\u2019 performance over time further underscores how important feedback is. Contrary to what we\u2019d expect, \u201cphysicians who have been in practice longer may be at risk for providing lower-quality care,\u201d according to a 2005 review in Annals of Internal Medicine. However, a certain type of doctor \u2014 a surgeon \u2014 does get better with experience. The reason, Ericsson points out, is feedback: \u201cSurgery is different from most other areas of medicine in that many problems are immediately apparent, such as a rupture of a blood vessel or damage to tissue.\u201d In contrast, a family doctor could misdiagnose the same illness time and again because there\u2019s nothing alerting him of his mistake.\n\nWorking with a coach or teacher is another integral part of deliberate practice. They identify problems and offer instruction and feedback. Although we may think coaching is reserved for athletes and musicians, professionals across industries, from sales to programming to writing, also use them. The Spectator filled this role for Franklin, as he compared his version of the article to the original. The idea is that over time students \u201clearn to monitor themselves,\u201d to find and fix errors, which requires \u201ceffective mental representations.\u201d\n\nA mental representation, as Ericsson calls it, is \u201ca mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else . . . that the brain is thinking about.\u201d For example, when someone talks about Vincent van Gogh\u2019s painting \u201cThe Starry Night,\u201d you may \u201csee\u201d the swirling blue sky that dominates the background and the sun in the far-right corner. Mental representations applied to skill-building work in a similar way.\n\nA quarterback with refined mental representations sees openings for potential plays, whereas a novice sees athletes randomly running on a field, tackling each other. A writer sees how words shape sentences and how sentences structure paragraphs, while a novice just sees a bunch of words on a page. After years of practice, you can develop \u201ccomplex\u201d representations of the different situations in your field. \u201cThe more [Franlkin] practiced, the more highly developed his mental representations became,\u201d writes Ericsson, \u201cuntil he could write at the level of The Spectator without having a concrete example in front of him.\u201d Over time, you can \u201cmake faster, more accurate decisions and respond more quickly and effectively in a given situation.\u201d\n\nJosh Waitzkin, who excelled at chess and the Chinese martial art Tai Chi Chuan, credits a similar technique for his success.\n\nWaitzkin began playing chess in Washington Square Park in New York City, and \u201cbecame a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the street,\u201d he recounts in his book, The Art of Learning. He soon dominated the professional chess world, too, winning the National Chess Championship as a nine-year-old and becoming an International Master at sixteen. Then, at age twenty-one, he began to study Tai Chi Chuan. In just a matter of years he was winning national and world championships in his division. \u201cWhat I am best at is not Tai Chi,\u201d Waitzkin writes, \u201cand it is not chess \u2014 what I\u2019m best at is the art of learning.\u201d\n\nHe suggests concentrating intently on a specific technique for a period time to \u201cgradually internalize the knowledge.\u201d For example, he \u201cfocused on small movements, sometimes spending hours moving [his] hand out a few inches, then releasing it back.\u201d This process results in a \u201crefined, nuanced understanding\u201d of a concept that gets ingrained into the subconscious mind, which is referenced quickly and automatically. He calls this way of practicing \u201cMaking Smaller Circles.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking Smaller Circles\u201d is a starting point for \u201cadvanced learning and action,\u201d says Waitzkin. Franklin, once again, is a great example. He created a poetry-writing exercise to help his vocabulary recall while writing, Ericsson explains, followed by another one that focused on the \u201cstructure and logic\u201d of his prose. We can apply this principle to our professional lives today. A salesperson attends a Toastmasters group to polish his public speaking skills. Then, he focuses on data analysis: learning how to read data to improve sales. The point is to break down a skill into small pieces and focus diligently on them.\n\nIf deliberate practice is the secret sauce to becoming an expert, why don\u2019t more people do it? Three reasons seem plausible. First, it takes a lot of time and hard work to engage in a rigorous practice session like Franklin\u2019s, and most people aren\u2019t willing to put in the time or effort.\n\nSecond, the demands of deliberate practice deviate from our culture of \u201cnow.\u201d Want to be entertained? Surf the internet. Want the latest gossip? Scan social media feeds. Want to book a trip? Use any number of apps on your smartphone. Many people treat skill-building the same way: learn it fast, learn it now. Instead of focusing on the best way to learn a skill, they default to the quick-fix approach. This trend is endemic in today\u2019s workplace.\n\nBosses send employees to conferences, workshops, and camps so they can learn how to sell, write, or public speak in a few days or weeks. Bootcamps are particularly popular. Many lure attendees by promising they\u2019ll learn to program or become a data scientist in just weeks. But Chi-chi Wang, a lead JavaScript engineer, points out that \u201cbootcamps, like video tutorials and college courses, are only a starting point.\u201d He\u2019s right. Thinking like a programmer doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nA third possibility is that deliberate practice runs counter to the widely-accepted wisdom that we need to put in thousands and thousands of hours toward a skill to be an \u201cexpert,\u201d or so the argument goes. I fell victim to this mentality as a basketball player, and found it didn\u2019t work. To be clear, you\u2019ll definitely put in the hours with deliberate practice \u2014 it is not a hack. But it takes the right type of practice to be an expert: going through the motions to hit a magic number won\u2019t cut it.\n\nYet society won\u2019t have it any other way. It\u2019s why people choose the professional with decades of experience. But research shows that even experience has its limits.\n\nYears of practice can help you improve up to a point. Shoot enough baskets and you\u2019ll probably sharpen your game. In general, however, \u201conce a person reaches that level of \u2018acceptable\u2019 performance and automaticity, the additional years of \u2018practice\u2019 don\u2019t lead to improvement,\u201d Ericsson says regarding research on the topic. In fact, he adds, it could make them a bit worse because \u201cautomated abilities\u201d slowly worsen without \u201cdeliberate efforts\u201d aimed at advancement.\n\nAs working professionals, deliberate practice matters because skills matter \u2014 and they\u2019re playing a big role in today\u2019s workplace. Most of us have misdirected our efforts for far too long, and that needs to change since building skills repeatedly is the future of work.\n\nJoe Mastey, an independent technology consultant and speaker, makes skill-building a priority for his own career. Although he\u2019s been programming for nearly fifteen years, he follows a rigorous plan for improvement: he writes code \u201cwith a business-oriented goal in mind,\u201d learns new \u201cprogramming techniques,\u201d and explores the latest technologies. And that\u2019s just for programming. He\u2019s also learning Japanese, and spends several hours each week practicing his language skills.\n\nMastey builds skills not only because he has to, but also because he wants to. It\u2019s essential to continuously learn in programming, he says, \u201cor you\u2019ll be left behind.\u201d He\u2019s also \u201cmore engaged with work and with life when . . . learning new things.\u201d Professionals today are taking control of their careers by repeatedly building skills on their own time and dime, but why?\n\nFrom New York to India, the workplace is being transformed in two major ways. First, advances in technology pose a threat to jobs. By 2020 about five million human workers will be displaced due to \u201cAI, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors,\u201d according to the World Economic Forum. \u201cIf technology doesn\u2019t eliminate or change the skills you need . . . it at least enables more people from around the world to compete for your job,\u201d argue Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha in their book, The Start-up of You. And yet the hype about outsourcing jobs is rivaled by \u201cbotsourcing:\u201d defined as \u201cthe replacement of human jobs by robots.\u201d\n\nMany predict that new jobs will emerge as others are lost due to AI, and we need to be ready. \u201cSkills like persuasion, social understanding, and empathy are going to become differentiators as artificial intelligence and machine learning take over our other tasks,\u201d says Harvard Business Review.\n\nThe second change is the booming millennial generation. Millennials are already the largest generation alive in America, and will make up more than a third of the workforce worldwide by 2020, according to ManpowerGroup. With a new generation comes new values. \u201cTheir strong desire for development is, perhaps, the greatest differentiator between them and all other generations in the workplace,\u201d reports Gallup. They\u2019re willing to put their personal time and money toward it, too.\n\nTogether, these changes intensify workplace competition and put a premium on continuous skill development.\n\nSkill-building has practical benefits. For one, skilled employees need to keep up with consumer expectations, explains Wang. Consumers count on \u201csleeker and more robust experiences,\u201d which means employees need to sharpen their skills to \u201ckeep up with these demands.\u201d iPhone users can relate. Each year they anticipate the release of a new iPhone \u2014 trusting each version is better than the previous one.\n\nFor another, skill-building gives you new ways of problem-solving, says Ozzy Chagatai, a full stack engineer. \u201cLearning skills, especially those that are outside of the ones you need to perform your work, gives you a new perspective.\u201d In fact, he tries to focus on skills that he doesn\u2019t \u201cget a chance to improve\u201d upon at his day job.\n\nDeveloping new skills can also help prepare you for future roles. Jeff Hoffman, Chief Development Officer and Partner at Havas Health & You, a health and wellness network, admits that he \u201ccan\u2019t keep up this pace forever,\u201d referring to his current role. He\u2019s preparing for the future by becoming a certified coach in the pharmaceutical industry. To build his skill-set, he keeps up with technology, increases his industry knowledge, and teaches entrepreneurship and leadership classes.\n\nSkill-building isn\u2019t just about the job, however. Franklin and Waitzkin, along with the individuals interviewed for this article, reveal another motivation: the desire to learn. Wang says his main motivation is learning concepts he finds \u201cfun and challenging,\u201d adding that the day he has \u201cnothing more to learn is the day [he\u2019s] done doing [web development] for a living.\u201d For Chagatai, it\u2019s \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d for himself and his craft. And at 77 years old, artist Kate Leigh Cutler is still looking to improve, and sees skill-building \u201cas a process, not an end.\u201d She\u2019s currently focused on a technique that combines the emotional tenors found in Mark Rothko\u2019s paintings with J.M.W. Turner\u2019s stunning atmospheric effects.\n\nThey\u2019re on to something. \u201cExpert performers . . . feel a tremendous sense of personal accomplishment from pushing themselves to develop new skills,\u201d writes Ericsson in Peak. \u201cIt is as if they are on a constantly stimulating journey . . . because there are always new challenges and opportunities.\u201d He\u2019s right. As I use deliberate practice to improve my writing skills, I\u2019m finding the process to be both stimulating and fulfilling. And that\u2019s another lesson I learned from my basketball days: enjoy the journey.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, then subscribe to my blog newsletter.

        "text": "As we all know, Jeff Bezos, once started a book store \u2014 Instead of a brick and mortar store, he preferred something new then \u2014 The Internet and his company was one of the few that survived the Dot-com bubble and Today Jeff Bezos is racing to be the World\u2019s richest man while owning Amazon Inc. (the used to be Bookstore), Blue Origin, The Washington Post.\n\nWhile I was watching his Fireside chat at Internet Association\u2019s 2017 Annual Charity Gala, Jeff B threw a few thoughts that would be very valuable for Young Entrepreneurs, hence listing it down:\n\nBusinesses are primarily built for the purpose of serving consumers, hence it\u2019s wise (but also risky) building a Customer-obsessed Vision. Jeff B himself acknowledges that Businesses that are Competitor-obsessed or Product-obsessed can/will work but it\u2019s not the ultimatum that can save any business, but if your business is focused on what your consumers want rather than what your competitors are building (who in turn are building for your consumers), you can be resilient for a catastrophic failure.\n\nWhen you\u2019re building a Costumer-obsessed business, It\u2019s not just good enough to stay ahead of your competition, But you\u2019ve got to stay ahead mulling what your consumers want. As Malcolm Gladwell once said,\n\nBut to produce what your consumer wants, you need to invent and to invent, you need to experiment. According to Jeff B,\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry while experimenting on something that you\u2019re very sure about its success.\n\nMeanwhile Jeff B draws a fine line between Failure (while experimenting new) and Bad Operational Excellence (Failure in existing process). And Failure during experimenting is acceptable (even though Jeff B feels its embarrassing) but the unexpected outcome (aka Failure) during a well-set process, isn\u2019t exactly Failure rather \u2018Bad Operational Excellence\u2019 and the example he referred to is that if Amazon\u2019s new Fulfilment Center Setup (after setting up thousands of Fulfilment Centers) doesn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s not a failure but Bad Operational Excellence which must be penalized.\n\nRunning a Regular Expression search for keyword \u2018disrupt\u2019 on every Business Plan or Pitch Presentation these days would always return TRUE. Because Entrepreneurs inherently believe that their idea or what they\u2019ve come up with is Disruptive. Jeff B breaks it for them:\n\nAnd he\u2019s absolutely right because no invention is disruptive until people who use it make it disruptive. Smartphones weren\u2019t disruptive, Apple and Android made it such a way Mass adoption made it disruptive. Jeff B went on saying that Amazon made so many inventions and those weren\u2019t disruptive because customers didn\u2019t like them.\n\nSuccess is one of the most argued events in our life. Most people still believe Success happens in a whim and that\u2019s a fallacy even Entrepreneurs who are known for taking risk fail to realise. Most people still talk as if AWS became a market leader in Cloud Business *just like that*. Taunting that, Jeff B says its another Overnight success,\n\nThus, Jeff B, currently the world\u2019s second richest man, debunks this myth of Overnight success which is one of the biggest pitfalls a lot of Young entrepreneurs falls (wondering a quick turn around in their business, they just started)."

        "title": "What Today\u2019s Superheroes can Teach us about Tomorrow\u2019s Leaders",
        "text": "The recent success of The Black Panther (among other Marvel characters) has caused me to reflect on the Superhero journey as it relates to the psychological hurdles and \u201cpassage\u201d (i.e. fears, trials & tribulations, triumphs) faced by these characters and how it relates to the similar journeys of the everyday leaders (entrepreneurs, executives, ect.).\n\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019re all familiar with the quintessential Superhero journey\u2026the once \u201ceveryday\u201d person who\u2019s trials and tribulations suddenly result in a pivotal moment, only to wake up one morning to develop super-human strength and capabilities in the long-lasting pursuit to defeat evil and getting the girl (or guy) at the end. These story-lines and character developments resonate with a broad audience due to the character\u2019s ability to overcome obstacles at all cost; and in unique ways, draw us in and inspire us to conquer our own personal challenges.\n\nIf you take a moment and reflect on the \u201csuperheroes\u201d who you aspire to be \u2014 they commonly embody this \u201cmore than human\u201d perception\u2026why is that? What defines a \u201csuperhero\u201d and what makes them \u201cseparate from the crowd\u201d? What part of the superhero\u2019s journey parallels \u201clegacy\u201d professionals we aspire to be? Is it their ability to use natural or unique hidden talents that are far above the norm to create unimaginable products or the ability to overcome and achieve the impossible?\n\nThere\u2019s a critical point to every superhero journey that is often neglected and yet extremely relevant to the most successful leaders: the development and extreme devotion to personal ideals and philosophies during periods of adversity, vulnerability, and most importantly; absolute safety and success\u2026.and this is harder than you think.\n\nSurrealist artist, Salvador Dali (pictured left), who\u2019s work was often inspired by \u201cdesire,\u201d (among others) believed that desire was the essence to be alive; we all want to apply our natural passions and talents, be recognized and rewarded by our peers, and to feel loved or accomplished. Personal ideals and philosophies should embody and exemplify what it means to be human; in essence, our desires \u2014 this requires continuous insight on our own individual \u201cend game.\u201d\n\nBased on your daily habits, what would you identify as your personal \u201cend game\u201d? Would your personal ideals and philosophies stand the test of time? Do they reveal what you are willing to fight for at all cost? Are your personal ideals limited to the pursuit of material possessions that can be lost or fade away over time? Are your ideals and core principles only self-serving and not for the greater good of others? A deep understanding of your end game will help drive daily purpose and intent; yet keep in mind the \u201cend game\u201d will likely change over time.\n\nAn understanding of the end-game presents another challenge, in what is referred to as the Mimetic Theory \u2026.why does one desire what everyone else wants? (material objects, jobs, destination vacations, ect.).\n\nStanford Philosophy Professor, Rene Girard (pictured left), developed the Mimetic Theory, which states the most basic way in which humans learn is through imitation of others and as a result, we often mimic or imitate the desires of other human beings. This was the underlining philosophy that convinced Peter Thiel to invest in Facebook and conclude that social media was going to be a breakthrough concept. A critical challenge in developing and displaying extreme devotion to personal ideals is often not conforming to the crowd (materialism, laziness, emotional self-serving, etc) and instead, devoting yourself to something much bigger than just yourself.\n\nI recently came across a fascinating study from Ohio State University that analyzed 273 individuals and conducted 35 in-depth interviews of those who participated in rescue efforts to help save the Tutsi from violence in Rwanda leading up to 1994 (full report here). The study attempted to answer why certain individuals make the conscious yet difficult choice of pursuing a path of heroism over the easy path of safety. Overall, the study de-emphasized personality traits and instead brought to light the importance of how social and situational context played a role in those who participated in rescue efforts; concluding that anyone has the capability of being a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nWhy do some individuals take action and others seek safety? At what point is one compelled to take action? Is it only after experiencing regret and remorse from a lack of action that we come to the realization that action is the answer? A true and deep understanding of taking action is an acceptance of personal responsibility, self-expression, and an understanding that your personal ideals and philosophies represent something much bigger than just yourself (i.e. legacy, culture, ect).\n\nThe perfect example of a superhero\u2019s journey experiencing a pivotal moment of truth and taking action is in Batman Begins (2 min clip here). In this scene, Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale \u2014 much better than Ben Affleck) is approached by Ra\u2019s al Ghul (played by Liam Neeson) in prison. He suggests that Bruce Wayne is lost and can offer him an alternative and more focused path that\u2019s aligned with his goals to fight evil in Gotham (alignment of the end game); this includes a devotion to his core ideals (Mimetic Theory), and Bruce decides to take action (devotion to something bigger than himself).\n\nI\u2019ve listed my own personal ideals and philosophies below (not to self-promote but hopefully will inspire others). I am by no means claiming to be \u201csuperhuman\u201d and I don\u2019t claim to live up to these ideals daily, but they are something to live up to and strive for everyday and will likely evolve over time (note, these are listed in addition to the basics such as honesty, integrity, and respect):\n\nWhat are your personal ideals you\u2019re willing to stand for in the face of adversity, safety, and success?\n\nThis article can also be found on LinkedIn (my profile) and my Twitter @DRB_3"

        "title": "When is it time to quit? \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Lately, I\u2019ve written a lot on the topic of quitting. I\u2019ve shared why generally I don\u2019t like to consider it as a viable option.\n\nI\u2019ve given a nod to the best ways of handling difficulty and hardship and shared my views on treating obstacles as opportunities to learn rather than blockers to deter us from progress. I\u2019m a firm advocate of committing to the process and applying discipline in the relentless pursuit of success. I\u2019m loathe to even contemplate the idea of quitting.\n\nAnd yet at the moment, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m really struggling with. I may even be giving in.\n\nI\u2019m forever encountering messages promising me that success is mine for the taking. What will apparently differentiate me from others who aspire to the same, is if I persist and work 10% harder, for longer and with more resolve than anyone else. I\u2019m reminded frequently of the tales of legend, of those whose successes came after years of adversity, multiple failures and repeated rejection.\n\nWhen I\u2019m tired, lacking in self-belief or worn down by the endless grind, I\u2019m reminded that habits take a long while to embed and to feel natural. Thirty days to form a new habit. Or is it ninety?\n\nOvernight successes take years, and I should be prepared for that.\n\nIn spite of all this hype and rhetoric, I want to quit. I want to give in on one of my business ventures for while I\u2019ve devoted hundreds, if not thousands of hours into it over the last 18 months, analysis tells me it\u2019s going nowhere. It\u2019s not all about the money, and I know that there are people who appreciate the service I provide, but I\u2019ve grown tired of battling the endless rejection and failure that repeatedly greets my efforts to monetise it.\n\nI feel I\u2019ve earned the honour through the free content and services I provide to want to see a little back. I\u2019ve delivered value and remain driven by a genuine desire to help my fellow human. However, it was always intended that there\u2019d be some benefit to me doing it, in terms of enriching my own life and that of my wife and kids too. That\u2019s not been forthcoming thus far.\n\nWhether I give it up or not remains to be seen. If I do, then it\u2019ll almost certainly be replaced by another project intended to achieve a similar aim; to create something, to help others to solve the meaningful problems they face in their lives and to ultimately improve and enhance my life as a result.\n\nI want to feel okay with this decision, like it\u2019s in my hands to choose my destiny and progress as I see fit. So why then do I feel so guilty for even contemplating it?\n\nI scarcely have to scroll through my Facebook feed or the suggested videos on YouTube before I encounter some meme, video or quote that berates me for contemplating quitting.\n\nAs I search for the most appropriate quotes to include in this piece, it actually makes me wince to consider the words that pour forth, no doubt intended to motivate, encourage and inspire. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a stigma associated with quitting, that it represents a crumbling of standards and demonstrates an unpleasant trait in those who display it.\n\n\u201cLosers quit when they fail. Winners fail until they succeed\u201d states Robert Kiyosaki.\n\nDolly Parton apparently tells us she \u201cnever tried quitting and never quit trying\u201d.\n\nAdmirable and stirring words from both, and I understand their sentiments.\n\nThis one has been quoted and butchered many times, and while powerful, it\u2019s also impossible to prove, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like saying that when you\u2019re searching for something you\u2019ve lost, it\u2019s always in the last place you look\u2026 well d\u2019uh?!?\n\nNaturally success will only happen in a venture where you don\u2019t quit, but there\u2019s no way we can ever prove that it\u2019s an inevitability much less that we were closest just before we lost heart and gave up the chase, is there?\n\nTo succeed, to win the prizes that so many desire but which so few are willing to work for takes tenacity, resilience and acceptance that there will be hardships, disappointments and failures along the way. What doesn\u2019t sit well with me at present is the feeling of disappointment that I feel in myself, the hollow sense of failure and the loss of a little self-respect for even contemplating a change of direction.\n\nI find myself playing back the many justifications for considering quitting; the lack of sales, the enormous amount of effort that I\u2019m putting into the project and the negligible returns or results. There\u2019s the opportunity cost of the many other projects that aren\u2019t moving forwards, and the time that I\u2019m not spending with my family either because I\u2019m embroiled in the work, or mentally drained from the efforts associated with it.\n\nWhy do I feel the need to justify it to myself? It\u2019s the same thing I find myself feeling whenever I contemplate a slackening or relaxing of standards in my entrepreneurial cause.\n\nIf I even think about setting my alarm for anything later than 5am on a work day, then I struggle with my conscience for missing my hour of power before work.\n\nWhen I listen to music in the car rather than a podcast or an audio book, I\u2019m pricked with guilt for the time I could be leveraging for the purposes of education and personal growth.\n\nSuch behavioural patterns and choices have become so engrained in me, that I take little joy from my dietary cheat-days even though I know they\u2019re an essential part of my health and weight-loss journey. I evaluate each occasional alcoholic drink consumed by the degree to which it will dull my edge the following day, rather than enjoying it in the moment as the rare indulgence that it genuinely is these days.\n\nHave I really lost control of my free-will or is is just that I\u2019m really bought into the process?\n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m fully behind the choices I\u2019ve made and the results I\u2019ve seen in my life. I feel, by orders of magnitude more productive, mentally agile, physically fit, fulfilled, optimistic and alive since adopting these wholesale changes in my life, than I\u2019d ever have dreamed possible. I\u2019ve built a series of positive practices into my existence that I feel are life changing.\n\nThe debate that I face right now needs to be split out into its constituent elements if I\u2019m to resolve it in a way that\u2019s satisfactory to me.\n\nDeciding the future of my project isn\u2019t a purely binary decision of stop or carry-on. When considered as a business, I have the choice to remove or lower my commercial expectations and continue in a more measured fashion as a labour of love, a passion project. This probably makes more sense as it will resolve the disappointments while allowing me to continue to serve those who value the service. Knowing it\u2019s run as a \u2018favour\u2019 also removes the bitterness when I don\u2019t receive the fair exchange of money for the services provided.\n\nAlternatively, I can dive into it further, accepting that it\u2019s going to be treated as any failing business would be in a crisis; where radical change and intervention is evaluated and future operations considered brutally in relation to numbers, facts and KPIs. This may ultimately prompt a \u2018stop\u2019 decision, but it will have come after a full exploration of all options, not just because I can\u2019t bear the feelings of failure any longer.\n\nIn the wider lifestyle choices, I need to stop treating those as black or white choices where one path leads to success, fulfilment and adulation and the other is a slippery slope to failure, disappointment and self-loathing.\n\nGetting an extra hour\u2019s sleep after a day in which I\u2019ve trashed myself at the gym isn\u2019t defeatist. It\u2019s smart, and likely means I\u2019ll be recovered and stronger, sooner.\n\nBlasting some thrash-metal on the car stereo when I\u2019m feeling low is as valid a thing to do as listening to an audio book on the importance of setting worthy and stretching goals. On a given day, either may help but neither is better than the other. It just comes down to what works.\n\nIt\u2019s admirable to have radically cut my alcohol consumption but with no intention of being tee-total and in spite of knowing that many of my entrepreneurial heroes prefer a triple-shot latte or a chocolate milkshake over a craft-beer, I shouldn\u2019t temper my modest enjoyment of what I want to drink.\n\nThere is true power in taking quitting off the table as a go-to option. Disappointment and failure is a part of life and it occurs more often when we\u2019re pushing outside of our comfort zone. To advance ourselves, we need to accept that fact. How we adapt to it is the measure of our commitment and our resolve to change and to achieve.\n\nTo believe that it somehow weakens us when our determination wavers, or to berate ourselves when we\u2019re unsure or in need of respite is also a dangerous trait to adopt. Every positive choice, every healthy or productive option I choose and every smile that I give or bring to another is a win. Just because these don\u2019t come in every moment of every day doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less committed to my cause than anyone else.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019m only competing against myself anyway.\n\nI\u2019ll still be the winner if I know that each action, decision and reaction was true to my inner values and if I know I did the best I could. Sorry if that sounds trite and self-congratulatory, but I needed to hear it now. Maybe you do too.\n\nToby Hazlewood is an author, parent, husband, project manager, entrepreneur and in his spare time, cycling enthusiast.\n\nAs founder of the Kintsugi-Life movement, he advocates treating times of hardship, challenge and adversity as an opportunity not just to survive or recover, but as a prompt to grow and strengthen, equipping ourselves to live a better, more fulfilled and successful life.\n\nYou can learn more about Kintsugi Life and receive a free video overview describing the Kintsugi Life concept, here\n\nYou can access tools, products, services and insight via Facebook.com/kintsugilifestyle, Facebook.com/divorcedlifestyledesigner or kintsugilife.co"

        "text": "Hyperledger Iroha is a blockchain framework contributed by Soramitsu, Hitachi, NTT Data, and Colu. Hyperledger Iroha is designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructure projects requiring distributed ledger technology. Hyperledger Iroha emphasizes mobile application development with client libraries for Android and iOS, making it distinct from other Hyperledger frameworks. Inspired by Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Iroha seeks to complement Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth, while providing a development environment for C++ developers to contribute to Hyperledger.\n\nIn conclusion, Hyperledger Iroha features a simple construction, modern, domain-driven C++ design, along with the consensus algorithm YAC.\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth, contributed by Intel, is a blockchain framework that utilizes a modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers. Distributed ledger solutions built with Hyperledger Sawtooth can utilize various consensus algorithms based on the size of the network. By default, it uses the Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) consensus algorithm, which provides the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain without the high energy consumption. PoET allows for a highly scalable network of validator nodes. Hyperledger Sawtooth is designed for versatility, with support for both permissioned and permissionless deployments.\n\nEg: Sawtooth lake: Sawtooth Lake blockchain technology can provide an immutable record of the provenance and lineage of various goods, like fish.\n\nHyperledger Fabric was the first proposal for a codebase, combining previous work done by Digital Asset Holdings, Blockstream\u2019s libconsensus, and IBM\u2019s OpenBlockchain. Hyperledger Fabric provides a modular architecture, which allows components such as consensus and membership services to be plug-and-play. Hyperledger Fabric is revolutionary in allowing entities to conduct confidential transactions without passing information through a central authority. This is accomplished through different channels that run within the network, as well as the division of labor that characterizes the different nodes within the network. Lastly, it is important to remember that, unlike Bitcoin, which is a public chain, Hyperledger Fabric supports permissioned deployments.\n\nHyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. Hyperledger Indy\u2019s goal is to achieve this by developing a set of decentralized identity specs and artifacts that are independent of any particular ledger and will enable interoperability across any DLT that supports them.\n\nIndeed, since 2013, over 9 billion data records were lost or stolen. What is striking is that, out of these, only 4% were encrypted, and hence, rendered useless after being stolen (also called \u2018secure breaches\u2019). You can find detailed statistics at\n\nOne of the key principles of Hyperledger Indy is its \u2018Privacy by Design\u2019 approach. Given the immutable nature of the DLT, it is all the more important that digital identities be handled with the utmost care, keeping human values front and center.\n\nCurrently under incubation, Hyperledger Burrow is a permissionable smart contract machine that provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter built- in part to the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is the only available Apache-licensed EVM implementation.\n\nFollowing are the major components of Burrow:\n\nYou can learn more about Hyperledger Burrow at"

        "text": "Most days I\u2019m done with work by 4:50pm. And I try to leave work by 5:00 so that I can be home by 5:30. Thankfully, 10 minutes is more than enough time to shut down from the day\u2019s work and shift mentally out of work mode and into home mode.\n\nA cluttered desk makes it hard to leave work in the evenings and even harder to get started the next morning. I always try to completely clear of my desk at the end of each day so that there\u2019s almost nothing on the surface of my desk. Everything is either in put drawers or filed away. Even if I know I\u2019ll need a piece of paper or book the next day, I put it away for the evening.\n\nThis does two things: First, it cues my brain that work is over, and that it\u2019s time to shift out of work mode. Second, having piles of stuff on my desk in the morning makes it harder to get right to work. It\u2019s harder to procrastinate when there are zero visible things to procrastinate on.\n\nBonus: Aesthetically I just find it incredibly pleasing to have a totally bare desk. But that\u2019s just the minimalist in me; you\u2019re mileage may vary.\n\nThis step is super quick. I simply scan my email inbox and recents text messages to make sure I haven\u2019t missed anything urgent that needs immediate action before I leave work. Even if I\u2019m 99.9% sure there isn\u2019t anything to do, the act itself of reviewing my inbox and messages is, again, a cue to my brain that I\u2019m closing the email/text loop. Which means my brain will be less likely to interrupt me with them later in the evening.\n\nAs a part of my To-Do/Organizational system, I keep a weekly list of all the tasks and projects I\u2019m working on for a given week. I briefly scan this and decide if there\u2019s anything on it that I want/need to work on the next day. In addition to making sure that I\u2019m on track for my weekly goals, this also helps my brain relax by seeing that I\u2019m aware of my longer-term to-dos and that I\u2019m making progress on them. Again, I\u2019m intentionally giving my brain less of a reason to interrupt be after work.\n\nBased on my inbox/text scan and my review of weekly to-dos (plus anything else in mind), I peel off a sticky note, stick in on my desk in front of my computer, and jot down the three most important things I want to get done the next day. I write them as short bulleted action items then draw a line under them.\n\nFor a long time the 4:55 drill ended at Step 4. But more recently I started including a final step that I\u2019ve found really useful. I call it Setting an Evening Intention.\n\nWhile the first four steps are about ending my current work day and making it easier to get started working the next morning, the final step is about making it easier to be present and relaxed at home.\n\nSo, underneath my three next-day work priorities, I write down one small intention I have for my evening. For example, it might be:\n\nJust like being intentional with my work priorities helps be to focus be productive, being intentional with my home priorities helps be be present and engaged with my family."

        "text": "By starting to devote a lot of time to learning how play the keyboard, I spend my spare time in a much healthier way. Previously, I filled up a good portion of my spare time with watching series.\n\nBut all this does is to make you look at the computer screen even more.\n\nI notice one thing very clearly:\n\nSo, this one habit is taking me away from the screen. It also gives my subconscious mind the space to process any problems that I am facing in my work. And, it gives me a different sense of inspiration and fulfillment.\n\nBut I notice much more changes in myself than just that.\n\nSince I\u2019ve started this new habit, I am also becoming much more motivated to change other aspects of my life.\n\nI see the benefits it has \u2014 both for my own sense of well-being and my productivity at work. The result is a strong urge to make even more changes that are long overdue.\n\nFor example, I wanted to go back to Tae Kwon Do classes for a long time.\n\nBut I always came up with different excuses. I told myself that I didn\u2019t have time to go classes. I told myself that it would be much better to stick with a sport such as running, where I could control my own time.\n\nTruth is, I just don\u2019t like running very much.\n\nI have liked Tae Kwon Do since I was a kid, because that is the first sport I have ever pursued. And the only one which I have maintained for a long time.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say here is that we all should re-learn to pay more attention to our urges. When our body and mind clearly tellus that we want something \u2014 then we should make it a part of our lives.\n\nWe think that we need to sacrifice these needs for the sake of maintaining our productivity at work.\n\nI now believe that the opposite is true. The more we sacrifice our own needs, the less we are capable to concentrate. The more obsessed we become with our productivity, the less energy we have to do meaningful work.\n\nYes, we need to put in serious work every single day.\n\nBut the solution is not to put in more hours.\n\nWe do the most meaningful work, when we are at the peak of our energy levels. And to maintain high levels of energy, we need to pay serious attention to our needs outside of work."

        "title": "How to secure your crypto investments \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Ok so you\u2019ve bought your first Bitcoin or Litecoin or whichever other coin you\u2019ve decided to invest in, but you\u2019ve also heard a lot of people talking about exchanges being hacked and that you should hold your own investments.\n\nSo how do you do this?\n\nBlockchains are designed to require no trust or third parties and in effect allow you to be your own bank. But with this comes the responsibility to store your own private keys.\n\nIn this article I share just a few of these things that I have learned through personal trial and error, conversations with people who are a lot smarter than me and a lot of reading.\n\nI hope these points help you to secure your crypto assets better.\n\nAs a quick introduction to those who are new to the space, wallets are used to store your private keys. These private keys are used to sign your transactions and in effect control all your funds, therefore securing your wallet/private keys is your main priority.\n\nI\u2019m also going to make a few assumptions here. I assume you want to store a significant amount of assets and you want them to be as secure as possible. This means you are willing to go to a little bit of extra effort to ensure your investments are secure. If your investments aren\u2019t that big yet, mobile wallets, web wallets or keeping it on an exchange are good options. I personally would not recommend these options for storing large investments though.\n\nPaper wallets are your first option and probably the most secure and similar to traditional assets. A piece of paper can be stored in a safety deposit box or safe, just like gold or important documents, and use the same security you have always used.\n\nTo use the paper wallets someone will have to get physical access to it and restore the private key to spend your assets. The very nature of the process makes it more secure, but also a lot more difficult to use. Therefore this option is not that practical when you are going to be sending transactions regularly. You will have to restore your wallet and then go through quite the process to create a new wallet after each transaction.\n\nPoints to consider with paper wallets:\n\nWithout this security feature anyone who has access to your paper wallet could take a picture of the private key and control your funds.\n\nFloods happen and water pipes burst, while paper wallets are very secure, paper itself does not handle water that well. So make sure your wallet is stored in a way that secures it from damage. Also make sure to have a backup which is stored just as securely as the original.\n\nHardware wallets are probably one of your best options when storing crypto assets, at the moment. These are small devices you can store your private and public keys on to ensure your assets are secure. These devices have their own operating systems which means they are secure even if you connect them to an infected computer as the private keys never leave the actual device. This makes them extremely secure.\n\nPoints to consider when using hardware wallets:\n\nAt approximately $100 per wallet this is an expense which is well worth it.\n\nOk now we get into the meat of it.\n\nYou are most likely only going to be dealing with desktop wallets if you are investing in assets that are not that well known and not yet supported by hardware wallets.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s your choice how to secure these assets, but especially if it\u2019s a significant amount of your personal wealth I would recommend looking into creating a secure desktop wallet to store the assets on.\n\nYour best option is to navigate to the team\u2019s Github page yourself and download the wallet from there.\n\nAlso make sure you update your backups regularly as you add new wallets etc. to ensure you don\u2019t lose any assets in the event of a disaster.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone to all this effort to secure your wallets, you don\u2019t want to fall prey to a scam or clever hacker on the internet. So when dealing with exchanges or whenever you are connected to the internet always consider these points:\n\n\u2014 DO NOT use SMS 2FA \u2014 this can easily be hacked and is not secure.\n\n\u2014 Use the software based 2FA where the code is generated by your cell phone. If you want to be really paranoid use an old phone that you keep offline -this is even more secure.\n\n\u2014 For the highest security, use a hardware based 2FA solution such as Yubikey.\n\n\u2014 Use 2FA on your email addresses as well, this adds another layer of security so hackers can\u2019t easily hack your accounts and reset passwords.\n\n\u2014 Everyone knows this address, and it will be the first address hackers will attack or try when attempting to log into your account.\n\n\u2014 Use a completely separate email address that is not easy to guess and is only used to log in to these sites.\n\n\u2014 Ultimate paranoia level 9000 \u2014 use a separate email address per website. Especially if you are a company or if you own a domain, \u2014 email addresses are easy to create.\n\n\u2014 This sounds stupid, but so many people forget it. If ONE of these sites get hacked and you used the same email and password, hackers now have access to all of your accounts.\n\n\u2014 Always use different passwords. You can do this by creating a long passphrase which changes per site based on the website name or you can use a password manager such as Keepass or LastPass.\n\n\u2014 Any hacker\u2019s goal is to get you to click on something. Either to download something malicious or to take you to a website they control which looks exactly like the original.\n\n\u2014 When you receive emails always hover over the links to check where they really lead.\n\n\u2014 If something sounds too good to be true it probably is.\n\n\u2014 If the message is urgent always be more sceptical. Hackers use urgency to get you to click on things without thinking. (i.e. Your account has been hacked, click the link to\u2026)\n\n\u2014 This goes hand in hand with \u201cDon\u2019t click on links in emails, discord messages etc.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hackers will use small differences in URLs to lead you to sites and steal all your credentials when you enter them.\n\n\u2014 If you use certain sites regularly bookmark these sites and use the bookmark too navigate to them.\n\n\u2014 Do not google and click the top link. Hackers will buy adds and use smart SEO tools to get their sites at the top of search results so you click on it.\n\n\u2014 This secures all the information you send over the internet and could also be used to mask your location if you are transferring large amounts and don\u2019t want your physical location to be known.\n\n\u2014 This goes for backups of your passwords as well as your private keys.\n\n\u2014 If these services get hacked all your critical information also gets hacked.\n\n\u2014 Especially if you are a big company, train your employees to know what to look for in phishing emails. This is still one of the most effective tools in hackers\u2019 arsenal. Even recently with news that Binance was hacked it turned out to be a phishing attack which caused users to give up their credentials that was the problem.\n\n\u2014 I know this is difficult but it\u2019s one of the best rules. If you tell everyone on the internet about your crypto millions you will eventually become a target.\n\n\u2014 If you run a company, teach your employees not to tell anyone what they deal with or to give away any specific details on how transactions are processed etc.\n\n\u2014 Your best security measure is to never even become a target.\n\nI really hope this helps you when securing your assets. This is the guide I wish was out there when I started on my journey.\n\nIf you feel I missed something or have anything to add that others may find use full, please comment below so we can all learn. I\u2019m sure there are some things I missed.\n\nFor anyone wondering about sharding of keys or multisig solutions, I intentionally excluded them from this post as I think that deserves an entirely separate article, which I am working on."

        "title": "Why employees leave managers, not companies \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Discussing over whether to hire the job seekers appearing for the interview rounds or not, I and the HR Manager have noticed a very persistent trope the other day. Surprisingly enough, when the interviewees were asked why they are looking for a new team, most of them didn\u2019t really have anything bad to talk about the company. In spite of how good their jobs are (or were), they\u2019re quitting because of not sharing a very healthy relationship with their reporting manager. This made me think of how bad managers can really be the reason that the best employees don\u2019t even give it a second thought while leaving your team.\n\nHere are the kind of people I really wouldn\u2019t like to have in the managerial positions, regardless the seniority level:\n\nDoes anyone want to be part of any of the above traps? Certainly not. At the same time, if I may ask, can we blame merely the reporting managers for the best paratroopers leaving our army?\n\nWhile there is always a thought of what kind of company, we at ProofHub, want to form, we also learn from examples that keep us in line with what kind of company we do not want to. Having that said, my experience says that generally, almost everyone gets a sense of mismatched chemistry during the hiring process. And if someone wants to leave one of your team members and not your company, don\u2019t you think you may consider other possibilities? For instance, how about the candidate didn\u2019t get enough exposure to their reporting manager during the hiring process? It could be the other way around too. And if the team has history of leaving the company because of their reporting manager, maybe it was a bad hire in the first place.\n\nWhatever the case is, teamwork is important. Having the best of the paratroopers leave your army isn\u2019t an option. If you want a team that has something to say, you have to surround them with leaders who listen. Otherwise, your brightest stars will flee and the remaining will lose motivation.\n\nSo, what to do when the individuals in managerial positions cost you the best of your resources?\n\n1. Invest in your managers so that they can invest in their team\n\nOne of the problems that cause managers not succeed at leadership could be that companies do not prioritize long-term investment in them. Be it programs that invest in improving their skills or rewarding them for their right habits, you can do it all. While you might be already rewarding them for the potential of their promotion, you might not be giving enough importance to the fact that they\u2019re building a healthy and long-term relationship with their teams.\n\nThe case can also be that managers are given a sense of urgency \u2014 they\u2019re fixing a problem the same day it\u2019s given. Ultimately, they\u2019re getting the job done at the expense of their team. You have to help them make time without giving up on targets. This could be easily done by incorporating time management into their managerial training.\n\n2. Managers need to build mutual understanding with their team members\n\nMutual understanding is not there by default. You have to build it. There are two options. One is to care deeply about your people and the other is to care about what they think of you. The former will always be the one to go with.\n\nWould you ever talk to a stranger about your problems? Building trust leads to candid conversations with the team. Not only managers can fix problems that are smaller, they can also succeed at building better relationships. To be professional and care about your team at the same time is not only possible but also a common practice among great leaders.\n\n3. Have 1 on 1s between managers and their team members at set times\n\nHolding a senior position implies that you sure have been in the \u2018buzzword trap of feedback\u2019 at one point in your career. I think many of us have oftentimes been in a situation where the feedback was given late or not at all. This leads to surprises in an employee\u2019s performance review, which should not be the case. Your team needs feedback to know where they stand and how they can improve.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve noticed that too much of a feedback leads to toxicity. Your team needs more feedback but certainly not every day. I think quarterly feedbacks do the job. Also, managers should not prioritize \u2018reaction\u2019 as a feedback style. Sending an abrupt note may feel good for the time, but does it fix the problem?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a good manager, you never want to put something in writing that\u2019s not been communicated verbally.\u201d \u2014 Paul English\n\nIt\u2019s certainly fine to give an immediate feedback when severe issues occur but in the rest of the cases, one can handle situations differently. Why not start a conversation with context and background in 1-on-1 meetings between a manager and a team member? We use ProofHub to fix these meetings on calendar and make sure no one forgets about them. Having a set time for 1-on-1 meetings will certainly remove all the fuss without even making it feel like a big deal. Not only their bond will be strengthened and they will get to know each other, they\u2019ll also get the assurance of never being ignored or left out of the loop.\n\nDon\u2019t we all know what makes a bad manager? We most probably had a few of them in our career too. From where I see, your team doesn\u2019t like micromanagement, doesn\u2019t like to be dumped and doesn\u2019t like to be completely ignored. Your team wants actual communication and connection. It wants conversations that build trust and projects that inspire. If you invest in managers that encourage the same, you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of team members breaking up with your managers and not your company.\n\nSandeep Kashyap is the Founder and CEO of ProofHub \u2014 a leading project management and collaboration software. He\u2019s one person always on a lookout for innovative ideas about filling the communication gap between groups, teams, and organizations. You\u2019ll find him saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d instead of \u201cGo!\u201d many times a day. That\u2019s what makes him write about leadership in a way people are inspired to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more."

        "text": "Early investors are rare, ones who add value even rarer.\n\nI wrote this piece to celebrate the fact that more and more women are pitching LPs, starting funds, and writing checks. In an age where the gender imbalance in VC (and technology more broadly) is finally coming into the spotlight, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air.\n\nI absolutely hated fundraising when I was a founder. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to admit that as an investor! But it may make me better in my current role, because I know that the process is imperfect and far from transparent.\n\nIt can be challenging to find investors you click with, who can add value to your business, who believe in you, and who won\u2019t do any of the terrible things you\u2019ve heard whispered about by other CEOs.\n\nOn top of all that, they have to want to write you your first check, which is priceless: that alone can get you started, fund your first hires, and ultimately help you raise more money.\n\nIn other words, getting the right early investors can make or break your company.\n\nBelow are five prodigiously talented female investors who we love to collaborate with at Founder Collective, and who you should reach out to. All are savvy, long-time operators with a track record of finding and supporting high-growth companies, from IoT to media to enterprise SaaS. Several have worked with literally hundreds of startups over time, and all are legendary in their ecosystems. As I watch them racking up their track records, I strongly feel we should be celebrating their brilliance further \u2014 hence the need for this post.\n\nRead more to see why I am so confident you will want them in your corner (and on your cap table):\n\nI met Jenny two summers ago when she was running the TechStars IoT accelerator in NYC, and nothing got me more excited than learning she had raised a fund and was starting to invest directly into teams she is passionate about.\n\nI\u2019ve known Soraya for almost ten years since we met at the NY Times, and she has always had her finger on the pulse of cutting edge brands and is a tireless advocate for founding teams. Her rolodex is unparalleled and she\u2019s not afraid to wield it on behalf of her teams.\n\nNimi Katragadda (NYC): Xoogler, Forbes 30 under 30, partner at Box Group in NYC\n\nNimi and her team are one of our first calls to collaborate with our fund. Founders across the NYC startup community value her sharp insights especially on early go-to-market questions.\n\nNicole is legendary in the Boston area for founding and leading Deploy Solutions (acquired by Kronos), as well as her commitment to early stage startups.\n\nElizabeth Yin (Bay Area): founder, ran 500 Startups Mountain View accelerator until 2017, when she founded Hustle Fund\n\nElizabeth and I were in grad school concurrently, and I remember her speaking and blogging about hacking acquisition for startups. Now, she\u2019s doing it on a much more massive scale. Having reviewed over 20,000 deals with her fund partner Eric Bahn as VCs, she brings great experience to the table. I particularly admire her focus in finding teams who execute regardless of what their resumes and/or past qualifications look like!\n\nIs it hard to get in front of value-adding investors?

        "title": "How to Create the Perfect Product Development Process",
        "text": "How, then, can we ensure that the processes we\u2019re putting in place are working the way we think?\n\nNo single process is ever going to work for every project, team, or team-member. Perfect is irritatingly elusive, and the best you can do is better.\n\nWith this in mind, the first thing to know about the Perfect product development process is\n\nBad processes can distract teams from their work, restrict creativity with overly strict rules, and ultimately result in projects that aren\u2019t successful.\n\nThe perfect process can clear blockers, keep everyone focused, and help frame projects according to their place within a wider strategy.\n\nThe process that you follow dictates the pace and quality with which you and your team develops product. It consists of all of the meetings, rules, JIRA boards, standups, ceremonies, and other constructs that are put in place to ensure that projects are consistent in direction and pace. They come in many shapes and sizes \u2014 Lean, Scrum, Waterfall, XP, and Kanban \u2014 to name a few.\n\nIf there\u2019s something I\u2019ve come to learn in my time managing product, it\u2019s that I never really have a firm grasp on how little I truly know.\n\nThere are volumes of material out there on various product approaches, and it\u2019s important to have some baseline knowledge on the essentials. I like to refer to the tools and techniques out there as tools in a product person\u2019s toolbelt \u2014 the more you\u2019ve built up your toolbelt, the more likely you are to have the tool for a particular challenge.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto offers a succinct look at the origins of \u201cAgile\u201d software development. Iterating, moving fast & breaking things, MVP \u2014 these are all artifacts of the Agile movement.\n\nFrom there, you might go check out something like User Story Mapping, by Jeff Patton, which wonderfully expounds on some of the tools that a team might use to ensure that product discussions remain centered around the people using the product.\n\nSprint, by Jake Knapp (and the rest of the team at Google Ventures) is a great example of a process that a team can follow when they\u2019re looking to find that first version of your product that will answer your big foundational questions around product/ market fit.\n\nUltimately, there are a lot of great books out there that will tell you some great ways that product can happen. Ultimately, how product should happen isn\u2019t something that you\u2019re going to learn from a book. There isn\u2019t a book out there that knows all of the nuances surrounding your team, your product, and your organization.\n\nLet\u2019s take Scrum as an example. It\u2019s a fantastic methodology, I recommend The Elements of Scrum, by Chris Sims, but it involves a lot of ceremonies (fancy word for meetings). In practice, I find that most teams decide that \u201cTextbook Scrum\u201d isn\u2019t for them, and they find a more pared down version that more suits their team\u2019s style.\n\nSuccess ultimately stems from understanding the principles of product development, and knowing when to deviate from them.\n\nSo you\u2019ve decided to implement a particular product development methodology. How do you know it\u2019s working? How do you know it\u2019s working as well as it could work?\n\nWhen we\u2019re building software, we constantly espouse the ideas of iterating, observing, measuring, and repeating. These same principles apply to the processes that we craft to enable the creation of our software. If we hope to create the perfect process for our team, we need to experiment.\n\nThere are a lot of great ways that you can make little changes to your process that can result in changes. My teams and I have experimented with pair programming, eliminating ticket assignments, mini-sprints, and 100% sticky notes. Some worked, most didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s ok!\n\nThe one thing that I can say about every experiment I\u2019ve made with my team is that they have helped to engage the team in a quality discourse about the merits of the process that we have in place at the time, which reminds me\u2026\n\nThe retrospective is one of the most powerful, underutilized tools in the product person\u2019s toolbelt. Use it!\n\nIn my limited time as a product manager, talking to my users has been the biggest determining factor in whether a product succeeds or fails. It seems obvious after the fact, but the more you know about a user, the fewer questions you have about how they\u2019ll experience various parts of your product.\n\nJust like your customers and users consume the User Experiences and products that your team creates, your team consumes the product development process that you\u2019ve created, and if you don\u2019t talk to them you\u2019re never going to know for sure whether it\u2019s being experienced positively or not.\n\nFace it, your team is probably going to have better ideas about how a process that might work for them than you will."

        "text": "Culture is about how it feels to come in every day and give at least eight hours of your time to your company or to your team. Good, aligned culture boosts productivity; it creates the atmosphere you need for innovation and creativity. A poor or mismatched culture can completely undermine all that you are aiming to achieve.\n\nGet your culture right and your team will have a great reputation that makes people want to work with you. Get the culture wrong, or ignore it altogether, and you can struggle to recruit or retain the people you want with the skills you need. Culture is spread by word of mouth by current employees to prospective talent.\n\nPeople may not be consciously talking about culture, but it is what they mean when they say things like \u201cwe are allowed to make mistakes and learn from them\u201d, or \u201cgood informal mentoring happens here\u201d. It creates your reputation as an employer and a leader.\n\nThis is why culture defeats strategy, every time. The best business strategy in the world cannot save a team mired in a destructive culture.\n\nCulture may seem a bit nebulous, even impossible to \u201csee\u201d or pin down. But I have created a set of questions both for leaders and for team members that can help you quickly reveal the culture in sharp relief. You will easily begin to see what is good and what needs attention in your team.\n\nThe culture of a team or company is set by the collective behaviour of individuals. Culture is the sum of the emotional intelligence of the group of people working together and what standards and values they adhere to.\n\nCulture is complex, but once you have identified the core values of your team, it becomes much easier to create the culture you want for your team. This is important because that in turn helps your business achieve what you need it to.\n\nIt is worth taking the time and going through these questions or something similar, so that you can be sure your team is working at its best. You will soon see it in your productivity, quality of work life, and ultimately, your bottom line."

        "title": "Why your startup has to do DevOps from day one \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Why your startup has to do DevOps from day one\n\nThe success rate of startups in 2017 was 2.5%. According to last year\u2019s statistics, 75% of US venture-backed startups fail. \u201cSuccess\u201d being translated to reaching the point of a successful sale. Obviously, the interpretation is objective, but the general idea is similar. \n\nLet\u2019s address the more interesting insights; 97.5% of the ideas fail to make it to a \u201csuccess\u201d point. Without dwelling too much on the interpretation, I\u2019d like to offer another angle to the story \u2014 operations; software operations.\n\nOps / DevOps / SRE and Production engineering are all fancy names to software operations. The very field that defines automation processes development for building, testing, delivering, monitoring, building resilient infrastructure, sometimes even experimenting with chaos and more.\n\nMost startups (and by startups I\u2019m referring to any team of \u2265 1 human beings with an idea and one written line of code) are probably not even considering the idea of implementing any component of the fields above. Scary terms like \u201cresiliency\u201d, \u201cautomation\u201d and \u201cscale\u201d sound like they come from the terminology world of Giants like Netflix or Facebook \u2014\n\nIf you have a great idea, already carved a plan, maybe even practiced some pitching and basically started working, you should be focusing on developing your product and doing that alone. \n\nAllow me to assume your company isn\u2019t already funded and backed by a management board (in which case these ideas are not even a considerable suggestion, but an urgent must), and as such you don\u2019t have the luxury of wasting\u2026 Anything.\n\nIf in the process of developing your product, you manually did one or more of:\n\nSound familiar? Don\u2019t get caught up, change direction and move forward. \n\nEasier said than done, but very much doable.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you are a team of one developer or even managing a remote entity to develop the product, certain decisions are required from day one of work. It\u2019s not trivial, but it is very much essential to the productivity of your team, and for the chances of breaking out and making your product rise above others.\n\nMy suggestion is not easy to adopt, but please hear (read) me out: \n\nTake a week worth of your R&D team work, even if it consists of a single developer, and invest it in building and setting up tools for automation, delivery pipeline and monitoring. Yes, \u201cContinuous Integration\u201d is not a scary buzzword, you don\u2019t need to hire experts or pay tons of $$, you can do it in a single afternoon. If you decide to put a day into it, you\u2019ll even get the benefits of a system that will suffice for a few good years to come, scout\u2019s honor.\n\nMake sure the entire team takes the week and focuses it\u2019s resources for this one purpose; the time spent and scale of productivity will naturally result in tools and processes reflecting the size of your team and it\u2019s requirements. Everyone will be onboard and share a sense of responsibility over the systems built during the week.\n\nIn order to illustrate the idea of automating operations and its affect on dev teams, consider these two models of team progress. Which one do you want be on?\n\nGot extra cash to use and want to save expensive time? \n\nTravis, CircleCI and my personal favourite- Drone, all have a SAAS service ready to roll so that the solution is managed, deployable in minutes, and takes the pain of operations away.\n\nGot your CI server ready to run? Great, take some time and build your delivery pipeline: plan builds, tests and deployments, so that your application would automatically flow through each of these steps independently with every push or merge request.\n\nMake sure results that require reporting like failed tests or unavailable services are being reported directly by email or the favourite messaging app of your choice. * Personal recommendation: Slack FTW.\n\nDo TDD! This cannot be stressed enough, investing in a good testing suite and letting it lead the way, would not only save time and energy, but also future frustration and all-nighters of debugging. This goes hand in hand with your already-designed pipeline of building, testing, reporting and deploying. Where a product is throughly tested, automation thrives (and as a side-effect, developers too \ud83d\ude09).\n\nDesign your application to produce verbose and meaningful logs. Report application activity and behaviour. Separate to different log levels and try to provide a useful structure like a constant JSON scheme. Think about the near future when some kind of ELK will start playing a role, allowing you to analyze any part of your application simply by reading shards of logs, and extracting the exact fields that were already indexed, thanks to your first week of work!\n\nLog analysis can wait, but make sure you understand what\u2019s at stake before deciding whether you allocate the resources in the scope of this week.\n\n \n\nWhat if you could start playing with your logs, instead of plainly reading them one by one? \u2192 Elastic provides a SAAS solution for ELK but you can do just the same with AWS CloudWatch, GCP Stackdriver or the feature-packed alternatives like Coralogix or Logz.io. Each providing his own benefits, and a managed solution that can be set up in hours.\n\nDo: Collect your logs and store them centrally, whether it\u2019s Logstash or S3, etc.\n\nDo not: Leave logs on machines / containers and SSH to read them.\n\nNot only will you compromise your resources while SSHing, this method of debug and analysis is not sustainable. Use an external service or a central storage at the least.\n\nBottom line: Do it. It won\u2019t be two weeks before you\u2019ll start enjoying the benefits of speaking the same language your product does; being able to practically ask questions and receive insightful answers, like:\n\nKnow what your application is going through at all times. Measure as much relevant metrics as possible to be able to debug, respond and improve quickly and in short cycles. Knowing how your application behaves is crucial; you need to be aware of CPU intensity, memory consumption and leaks, as well as latency of requests and levels+nature of errors.\n\nYou do not need a gigantic monitoring platform, you can start small with managed solutions by your favourite cloud provider, e.g AWS CloudWatch metrics. If you\u2019re cloud-based, everything is already collected for you, all you have to do is pick it up: invest a couple of hours and choose what you would like to be visibly aware of.\n\nShort on time? Set up a service like RunScope or PingDom, which would be super easy to deploy, and constantly measuring your service/s health. You may not know the bits and bytes of every problem, but at least you\u2019ll be aware.\n\nGot extra time? Use Prometheus which will collect applicative metrics, and then view in a tool such as Grafana. This couple will provide a more in-depth and customized visualization possibilities, which will be able to scale into any size of production resources, and deal with future application metrics.\n\nOr: deploy a plugin based monitoring tool like Sensu and use it either with installed agents (push) or probing the services for information (pull).\n\nGot extra cash? Take NewRelic / DataDog / any other application monitoring solution for a test drive. The things you\u2019ll learn about your application will deeply influence the quality of your development process, and as a result \u2014 the quality of your product.\n\nBottom line: Even if you start lean, start with the basics, know your systems\u2019 metrics. In most cases they are already collected, just organize and monitor.\n\nBased on your already-collected metrics, set alerts to points where certain thresholds are crossed and notify yourself / your dev team. Knowing exactly when something goes wrong, doesn\u2019t only save you in production. Even if you\u2019re still developing your product, you\u2019ll be able to catch errors as they happen, ease the process of debugging and history searching and keep improving in short cycles of feedback.\n\nAgain, in most cloud platforms, since you already got the metrics collected for you, all that\u2019s left is to set the alarms and notifications, e.g AWS CloudWatch Alarms.\n\nUse Slack (or equivalent): Integrate bots and incoming web-hooks to send as much as possible incoming data from your systems \u2014 alerts, notifications, reports \u2014 present them all in one place that\u2019s easy to read and track. Prevent alert fatigue by applying logic on when to alert and how.\n\nGot extra cash? Add a product like VictorOps / OpsGenie / PagerDuty for reporting, on call shifting, team reporting management and escalation policies. Even if you don\u2019t utilize their entire feature set, you\u2019ll be able to be informed and respond to issues as they happen, and share them with the rest of the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, \u201cDevOps\u201d is all about communication. Being able to deliver ideas, break silos, collaborate and reach common grounds are all the building blocks for making dev and ops work together.\n\nBuilding communication between teams is not an easy task. Hell, even between two people you can sometimes get lost.\n\n\n\nWhatsApp or Telegram are nice for private chats or discussions, but your plans, tasks, and work related chats should be contained in a searchable structure that\u2019s easy to work with.\n\nReduce emails: Use a communication app like Slack to create different discussion channels, share documents, designs, logos, links and everything related to a certain topic, so that you\u2019re able to come back to and find it easily.\n\nPlan and collaborate on one central place. Use a product like Atlassian\u2019s Jira to manage sprints, tickets, projects and overall timeline and progress.\n\n* Pro tip \u2014 Connect your planning product to Slack as well to keep track on tickets; moving, creating and updating them without ever logging into the system.\n\nWith a week of work you can achieve all of the above, and even more with some motivation. Although they seem somewhat distant and irrelevant to your product\u2019s phase, these set of tools and platforms will not only boost your development speed, it will make your entire process fluent, responsive and fun to work with. It would save tons of hours of recurring work, debugging and searching. You\u2019ll become proactive and on top of the system instead of the other way around. Planning to grow? On-boarding of a new engineer takes a lot of unproductive time of him and his guide. Automated systems would take half the time to explain and on-board, while preventing expected mistakes.\n\nMost of the solutions above would be free of charge to a certain extent, the rest would cover their costs within one month of operation, guaranteed.\n\nEven if you are a team of one developer, and maybe especially if you are alone in the battle: having a supportive ecosystem of tools will help you constantly manage and improve the quality of your product. You\u2019ll be completely killing waste, which will allow you to focus on the one thing you should \u2014 innovation."

        "title": "I Self-Sabotaged my last Business. It won\u2019t Happen Again.",
        "text": "My first business, a b2b mobile app, failed miserably. I was a computer science major at the time and my co-founder was the business/marketing person. We had no idea what we were doing and had no idea how to get customers.\n\nDespite the emotional highs and lows, I loved the experience and wanted to be an entrepreneur again. Even as I started working full-time as a software developer, I was always thinking about how to start another startup.\n\nAfter a few years, a few non-technical founders asked if they could hire me to code up their startup ideas. I was bored with my job and had savings, so I thought what the hell, why not start a freelance business. It wasn\u2019t the high-growth startup I imagined, but I could use the flexibility to better work on a new startup, whatever it might be.\n\nI quit my full-time job. This time, I wasn\u2019t going to fail. I would become a successful freelancer and then start a successful startup. I remember thinking to myself: I\u2019m never going to be a full-time employee again.\n\nThough I made a decent amount of money, I absolutely undercharged for what I created. I don\u2019t want to think about the hourly rate I charged because it was probably under minimum wage. Still, I figured that as I got better at pricing and marketing myself, I\u2019d be able to charge more and find better clients.\n\nLooking back, I realize that I had absolutely no plan or direction for my freelancing. I was like the South Park underpants gnomes. My business plan was:\n\nAfter my first two contracts ended, I struggled to find more work. I had no idea how to market myself and I loathed working for wantrepreneurs. I hated the times when I was struggling to find clients, but I hated working on an app that I knew would fail even more.\n\nSecretly, I began to hate working on my freelance business. I loved the flexibility that it gave me, but I just didn\u2019t enjoy the work. That dream of starting a startup never died, but it seemed so distant. I read lots of business books, but I just couldn\u2019t find a way to go from where I was to being a startup founder.\n\nEven though I rented a desk at a co-working space, I didn\u2019t go to it everyday. Sometimes, I would stay at home playing Hearthstone (a digital card game). It was a complete waste of time and money, but it helped distract me from my conflicted subconscious. My biggest accomplishment (and embarrassment) was becoming the 69th ranked Hearthstone player in North America:\n\nThis whole time, my savings were dropping. I hoped that the loss of money and fear of poverty would motivate me into action, but it didn\u2019t work. Trying to motivate myself based on arbitrary numbers I saw on my mint account was a dumb idea.\n\nI didn\u2019t know this at the time, but I was subconsciously self-sabotaging myself. I actually *didn\u2019t* want to succeed. If I got more work, it would mean more time building web apps for companies that had no chance of success. I couldn\u2019t see any possible way I could go from freelancing to startup, so why bother finding work in the first place?\n\nEventually, I had no choice but to realize the obvious: my freelancing career was a total disaster. I loved being my own boss, but I had no passion for creating web apps for companies that were going to fold in a year.\n\nAt some point, I started getting worried about my lack of money. I checked my Mint App every time I used my credit card. I had nightmares of losing my apartment.\n\nIt was at this point I started frantically trying every marketing strategy I could google. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious I should have picked one or a few strategies and perfected them. Desperation has a way of clouding the obvious and making you do stupid things.\n\nWith my savings dwindling to dangerously low levels, I did the only reasonable thing I could think of: I got a full-time job.\n\nIt was remarkable how easy it was to be a full-time employee. I went to work, did my job, and that was it. No more worrying about clients or bills or any of the other headaches of running a business. The steady paycheck, which was way more than what I made as a freelancer, was especially nice.\n\nPart of me thought that the entrepreneurial bug inside me had been killed. After such a brutal failure, the last thing I wanted to do my to fragile ego was take on the uncertainty of entrepreneurship again. Instead of doing a side hustle, I began doing social hobbies, like improv. Life was simple and easy.\n\nAfter a few months, it came back: my entrepreneurial itch. Despite the pain it caused me, nothing was quite as fun as running my own company. I still wanted to feel that mixture of freedom and anticipation I felt running my first business in college.\n\nMy entrepreneurial itch didn\u2019t tell what business I should start, just that I should start something. It seemed like I was back where I started, wanting to start a startup but having no clue how to get started.\n\nI also hit a quarter life crisis and began asking myself the bigger questions. The why am I here and what am I doing type questions. I thought about what I wanted to do with the few years I have left on earth.\n\nI managed to figure out a few core goals I wanted to achieve in my life:\n\nTo do some of the things I wanted to do, I needed to become rich and powerful. How would I do that? Entrepreneurship. What business would I create? I needed to play to my strengths and interests. I decided on doing something that mixed my skill in programming with my interest in helping companies grow.\n\nWhile surfing the internet, I discovered bloggers analyzing data and writing about it. They received links, shares, and public praise. I decided to try it out for myself.\n\nI threw together a quick website with a name I made up in an hour: Growista. Using programming, I analyzed 1,000 infographics and wrote about my findings. I reached out to some journalists and one of them wrote about my research in MarketingProfs, a famous marketing site. I tried it again by analyzing 100,000 viral posts and was mentioned in Forbes.\n\nI decided to offer my process of using programming to analyze data as a service. I received interest and clients without working too hard. Some people reached out who knew nothing about me but loved what they saw on my site.\n\nIt became obvious that I was onto something. People talked to me about Growista as if it was a mature company. This side project I started was turning into a real company.\n\nEven though I made more money as a freelance developer, Growista feels different. I have momentum. I have a small but significant amount of traffic and email subscribers. Real customers are paying me for the impact I have on their businesses. Everything is trending upwards.\n\nI have a clear path to having a bigger impact in the world. Though I\u2019ll be consulting for a while, I plan on offering either online courses or more affordable mass coaching in the future.\n\nI have ambitions of turning Growista into a company that helps thousands of entrepreneurs use technology to create better content. I can prevent their businesses from failing like mine have.\n\nI plan on working on Growista for the rest of my career. It would be amazing to continue working for Growista like Warren Buffett, at 87, loves working for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nI now have something 85 percent of global workers don\u2019t: a job I love. After my day job, I\u2019m excited to come home and work on Growista. I\u2019m again feeling that excitement I had when I started my first company in college.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether Growista will be successful or not, but I do know one thing: I\u2019m not going to self-sabotage this business and I\u2019m going to work my ass off to make it succeed."

        "text": "How many times have you had an idea for a startup, but stopped yourself from actually doing it because you had no technical co-founder and didn\u2019t have the skills to build it yourself? I know, a lot of us have been there.\n\nThe great news is you no longer need to have technical skills, or a technical co-founder to build your product. In this article, I will walk you through the process of building an MVP without writing a single line of code.\n\nLet\u2019s put first things first \u2014 \u201cMVP\u201d is short for \u201cMinimum Viable Product\u201d. The concept of building and quickly testing the first version of your product is at the heart of the Lean Startup movement, started by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.\n\nLean Startup revolutionized the manner and speed at which entrepreneurs launch their startups (no longer does one write an infinitely long business plan, spend years on research and development, and launch the product once it feels 100% ready). The \u201cLean Startup\u201d way of thinking tells us to develop the minimum amount of features in a product to sufficiently deliver the core value proposition, launch it, then measure and learn how to develop from there. Continuous testing and improvement of your app is meant to enable you to move from a first version to a final version as efficiently and accurately as possible.\n\nThe term \u201cMinimum Viable Product\u201d became widely popularised by Eric Ries with the launch of The Lean Startup book in 2011. Eric Ries describes a minimum viable product as: \u201c[the] version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort\u201d. Think of the MVP as a prototype, which has the sole purpose of validating whether or not your customers are willing to pay for your solution. By using an MVP to quickly validate your ability to satisfy customers and their ability to pay, you reduce the immense cost and risk of building the wrong product.\n\n5 ways to build your MVP on your own\n\nSo, how can you build an MVP without a technical co-founder?\n\nIt just so happens that Zeroqode provides you with a range of no-code tools and templates. Bubblewits can build the app for you without code with lightning speed and efficiency. :)\n\nEither way you go, you\u2019re guaranteed to save money and time, and launch your MVP as quickly as possible.\n\nYou are the best judge to decide which of the above options is best for you. A lot of ideas for the products and services that passionate people are coming up with have the potential to be real game-changers in their industries. If you choose not to implement it just because you have no technical skills or someone said you can not be successful without a technical co-founder, the world may miss out big time.\n\nLooking for No-Code Templates that fit your startup idea? Check out Zeroqode for inspiration!\n\nIn need of a team to build the product for you? Reach out to us here Bubblewits!"

        "text": "William Candillon is a 31-year-old software engineer from France. He built React Native Starter Kits during a sabbatical and now has repos , writing , and videos centered on React Native development. William currently lives in beautiful Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.\n\nThis was first published on my newsletter Query . Every week I pose three questions to a founder of a successful business.\n\nIn the case of the React Native Starter Kits, transparency as helped on two fronts. It enabled me to validate the product/market fit before investing a lot of work into the product. And once the product was ready, transparency has helped customers to get better insights about what they are buying, as well as better support.\n\nFrom the get-go I shared my plans with the community. I built a landing page that contained screenshots of the finished product, even though not a single line of code was written yet. People could leave their email if they were interested in getting the kit once it was ready. This landing page was linked into my medium stories on React Native.\n\nAfter that, when the product picked up momentum, I started to code the starter kits live on YouTube. Not only has it been an enjoyable process, but the feedback from the community has been great, and it really gives potential customers a sense of what they would be buying. It has also helped tremendously with customer support. Many questions can be answered by pointing to the right YouTube video.\n\nA market place for React Native app already existed: NativeBase Market Place. This was extremely convenient because it takes time to build your own sales channel. Today, half of the sales are made directly, but it took many months to get to that result. So having an existing marketplace for the product was very valuable.\n\nThe size of the React Native community is substantial, but there is a lot of mistrust in these starter kits, as there should be! \ud83d\ude05 Beginners in the community might not have enough knowledge to grasp the value provided by these kits, and people who are advanced enough to understand the value might consider doing it themselves, just because it\u2019s fun to do. Therefore, the targeted segment in this large community is relatively small.\n\nAs a developer, I\u2019m focused on code quality, trying to reduce technical debt as much as possible, and delivering the best product possible. The downside of this love for good software engineering is that other aspects of the product like online marketing get neglected.\n\nDevelopers always want to build cool things and continuously improve on them. But with the React Native Starter Kits, it is now clear to me that sometimes commercial data should drive the process instead.\n\nSign up for my newsletter Query, where every week I pose three questions to a founder of a successful business."

Customers want to meet their new products at a satisfying standard but for the fact of meeting a product that is doing the bare minimum wouldn\u2019t suit me, I\u2019d just go to another product that is in the relative market.\n\nSome other entrepreneurs have probably built on their product at the start with an MVP because\n\nWhy is a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) better then a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?\n\nViable synonyms are workable, usable and lovable is something you give care or in other words more value.

        "text": "There are two famous aphorisms about online marketing. \u201cContent is king.\u201d and \u201cMoney is in the (email) list.\u201d\n\nBoth expressions have a point. They summarize the decade long experience of online marketers. Content and email lists are critical components of online marketing.\n\nThere is a third component that doesn\u2019t have its own aphorism yet. That component already became the most critical part of many online marketing businesses.\n\nI\u2019m talking about data. We all heard about big data. The term big data sounds like something that can only be used by multinational corporations. That\u2019s not true.\n\nYou can make use of data in your small business, even in your personal social media account or blog. I already explained how I use Medium stats to improve my blogging. However, there are two pitfalls for beginners when working with data.\n\nI published a blog post about possible pitfalls for the first time bloggers called Read This before You Start a Website or Blog.\n\nIn essence, when you first start a website or blog, there are a lot of things you can do. One of those things is to install Google Analytics and AdSense to your website.\n\nThen, you hit the refresh button every five minutes to check the number of visitors and the money you made. I know this too well, because I\u2019ve been there too.\n\nGoogle Analytics and AdSense becomes a slot machine for the first time blogger. They hit the refresh button like they\u2019d pull the lever of a slot machine.\n\nThose tools become a sort of entertainment. The first time blogger expects a prize from those tools. As a result, they waste their time and attention on them, instead of working on their blog.\n\nIf this sounds like you, I recommend you read my post The Only Tip You Need to Grow Your Audience as a Blogger.\n\nHow Do the Professionals Use Data?\n\nI\u2019m a full time software developer. Sometimes, we come across performance problems in our software. When that happens, we use a specific type of software called \u201cprofiler.\u201d\n\nA profiler shows us which code parts consume the most resources. Then we optimize those code parts for resource consumption. Our goal is to eliminate those bottlenecks.\n\nCan You See the Difference Between How a Professional and an Amateur Uses Data?\n\nA professional uses data for a specific goal. They use it to make a certain decision. They use it to take a certain action. They use it to learn something valuable that they can use later. They use data only, when it is needed.\n\nAn amateur sees data as entertainment. They expect the data to make them happy. They see it as a playground or casino. They keep playing with it without any specific goal.\n\nHow does your data serve your overall goals? If you don\u2019t have the answer to that question, you might be misusing data.\n\nBy improving some parameters in your data set, you might actually worsen the overall performance of your business. I touched upon this issue in my post Measuring the Contribution of My Medium Posts to My Content Marketing Goals.\n\nHow to Avoid the Pitfalls When Using Data?\n\nIf you want to avoid the pitfalls when using data, start with writing down what your objective is. Then, write down which information you need from data to serve that objective. Coming up with a relevant set of questions is the first step to success.\n\nMy goal is to improve the conversion rate of email newsletter subscriptions in my blog. Here are a few questions that would help me with that goal.\n\nThese are just a few of the many more questions that I ask myself. When I have the answers to those questions, I\u2019ll come up with a set of action items based on those answers.\n\nData is the gold mine of the day, but you need to know how to use it.\n\nYou can use it as entertainment. You can use it to optimize specific parameters without seeing the big picture. Both usages are pitfalls.\n\nIf you want to make the best of your data,"

        "title": "The Power of Style Guides \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "What is a brand style guide? A style guide is a set of standards for the design of documents and any other form of brand identity elements. It is a reference tool that supports consistency by showing how a brand should look, feel and sound.\n\nWhy are style guides important? Consistency is key to building a memorable brand. Style guides ensure brand consistency throughout any collateral you produce \u2014 no matter who creates it: customer service, marketing, design or sales.\n\nTop brands stick in our minds because they define their presence by repeating their logo, fonts, colors, and images. Over time, they become recognizable as the brand, creating a sense of reliability and security. Inconsistency weakens your brand image, makes your company look unprofessional, and hurts conversion rates and revenue.\n\nThe number one goal of a style guide is consistency among the various elements that, when combined, create a recognizable brand. With a brand style guide in place, everyone should understand what the brand is and how to use it in the work they do.\n\nFollowing a style guide allows new work be as near to a final version as it can be. The reduction in the time spent on revisions, in editing, and giving corrections cuts the costs of operating.\n\nDepending on your business you may need one, or several, different guides. There are a variety of style guides:\n\nStrong and consistent branding is a vital foundation for improving brand recognition, awareness, and loyalty. Every time you reinforce your brand in the customer\u2019s mind you improve the likelihood they will think of you when it is time to buy.\n\n1. Logo\n\n Your logo is the foundation of your visual identity. You need it to be consistent wherever it\u2019s displayed. Use your style guide to show proper logo use and acceptable variations. It\u2019s a good idea to take this time to show how not to apply the logo.\n\n2. Typefaces\n\n Type is a large part of any collateral you make. Consistency in your typography supports your brand and helps project a sense of professionalism. Give explicit rules for what typefaces are acceptable and guidelines for alternative styling, size, and color.\n\n3. Color Palette\n\n In your style guide, show swatches of your brand colors. Make sure to include the information needed to reproduce those colors wherever your brand message appears. Choose four or fewer main colors and avoid straying from the hues of your logo.\n\nColor is represented in a number of ways depending on where it is used:\n\nFrom Pantone color numbers to CMYK blends and RGB or HEX values, colors can shift from designer to designer or program to program. Defining colors avoids any ugly surprises and saves both time and money.\n\nNeed some color palette inspiration? Check out these online resources for ideas:\n\n4. Photography\n\n Photography can be a vital part of a brands visual identity. If it is an important part of yours, you should include it in your guide for any photographers you work with to reference.\n\nYou can approach this in a few different ways. If you have them, show images that have performed for your brand in the past. Don\u2019t have your own examples? Go aspirational \u2014 find examples from big brands that you like. Or create a mood board of images that convey the feelings you want people to have when they think of your brand.\n\nPinterest is a great place to research style guides, color palettes, and create your mood board.\n\n5. Supporting Graphics\n\n Supporting graphics help set your brand apart. Include them in your guide to make sure they are used to greatest advantage. You could provide links to specific sets stored online so they are easy to find. Be sure to provide icons, patterns, size variations, and color preferences.\n\nImage guidelines should define when and how certain types of images are used. Will you use photography or illustrations or both? Will they be black and white or color? Is clip art use acceptable?\n\n6. Brand Voice\n\n A brand\u2019s voice is as important as the brand\u2019s visual style. Your brand should sound and look a certain way. In an ideal world, you would have one person writing everything, but most of the time that\u2019s impossible. Giving the writers you work with guidelines for how they should write about your brand will help avoid any instances of sounding off-brand.\n\nYou may want to create a separate style guide for writing. But it is good to provide a little guidance in the visual guide. Using a consistent and distinct tone can help clients and customers identify with your brand, and creates an association with what the brand stands for.\n\nSimple is best. You might include particular words and phrases that you like and which words should be avoided. Be sure to include who you\u2019re targeting and how it should sound. Think about words you want to be connected to \u2014 cool, trustworthy, hip, efficient, luxurious.\n\nEvery brand, from the smallest website or startup to corporate giants need a set of branding guidelines. This document, which can range from a few pages to several hundred, shows your team how to stay true to your brand. To see how simple it can be, check out Medium\u2019s branding guidelines.\n\nEvery guide will be different as your brand style guide should reflect your organization. You may find it useful to create an outline to help you decide the structure of your guide. Use the six points laid out above, along with any business-specific needs, to create your outline.\n\nYour brand style guide is a living, breathing document. You can add to or adjust it as you learn what works. Well-defined and maintained style guides allow you to present your brand clearly and to establish trust with your audience.\n\nPlan to revisit your style guide from time to time. Depending on your business and how fast you evolve this could be every month, quarter or year. Make the process easier by keeping ideas in one central place as they occur.\n\nMany businesses avoid creating a style guide because of the time involved. But a style guide is essential to building your brand identity consistently \u2014 especially when you have several people developing content for your brand. It\u2019s important to spend the time and resources to create these invaluable documents."

        "title": "Returning to India: A decision framework \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "My recent post about heading back to India as a venture capitalist after almost 15 years in the US made me realize just how many people in my network have been mulling on this broader topic: moving back to their respective home countries from their current country of residence for various reasons ranging from doing a startup, to joining a big firm, etc.\n\nReturning to India had far too many aspects to consider: family, career path, day to day, salary, lifestyle, and overall happiness. What really helped me decide to make the jump was a set of frameworks I went through in evaluating the top 3 factors in this decision: (1) why am I moving to India? (2) when is the right time to move? (3) what should I do in India that is 10x of what I could do in the US?\n\nFeel free to ping/follow me on twitter or linkedin if you have questions. Much obliged if you retweet, or share.\n\nIf you are like me and have lived/worked in multiple countries and traveled quite extensively, it is likely that you love a lot of places! When thinking about where I wanted to be long-term, I was always asking myself, \u201cwhere do I want to live\u201d and it was impossible to make up my mind this way. The right question was \u201cwhere do I want to die\u201d. There was no confusion about that question.\n\nThe moment I knew the answer to that question in my heart, the next question was, \u201chow far back do I walk from, well, death?\u201d Do I wait till retirement? Till I hit 40? Or should I go now? Which brings me to the second framework.\n\nThis is mostly self-explanatory. Personally, for me, the \u201cnow\u201d option seemed impulsive \u2014 only to be taken if there is a family urgency or if the option is forced upon you (e.g. visa complications). The \u201cnever\u201d option often is about having too deep a root in the your current country of residence \u2014 a partner disinterested in moving, or kids, health needs, etc. I luckily had no such constraints so I could focus on creating the right conditions under which the move back to India would have the maximum chances of success.\n\nTo arrive at the \u201cright condition\u201d step however, we need to back up a little to what I call the \u201ccareer gap analysis\u201d framework. It\u2019s one of the more useful frameworks I\u2019ve used and if you are honest and consistent in your efforts, it works.\n\nCareer is a long game. I\u2019ve thought of my career as a X-Y graph where, at time T=0, I am at the bottom left and trying to move to the top right. For this to work you need to know what the top-right is. Take a few samples below:\n\nThink through where you are today and where you want to be 5 years from now. For example, if you want to start-up you need to build a \u201csuperpower\u201d \u2014 something only you can bring to the table, either in tech prowess, or market understanding, or connections. You also need to build conviction and passion for an idea to survive the hard times, and you have to be an execution machine, among other things. Start working on those.\n\nI think of the Z-axis as a driver for step-function improvement on the Y axis. It\u2019s really difficult to grow (and grow fast) till you put yourself outside of your comfort zone. What brings about this discomfort is a movement on the Z axis \u2014 the drivers of growth \u2014 e.g. a new role within the same company, furthering your education, changing your company, changing location, etc.\n\nTaking my career as an example.\n\nI was an engineer right out of college but after 6+ years of writing code I wanted a more business-centric profile. I shifted into a product manager role within my firm (role change), followed by an MBA (education), after which I joined Google Cloud in a strategic business development role. Few years in, I got curious about investing and also started orchestrating a move to India. While @ Google I helped out during deal diligence for GV and CapitalG and also participated or led a few investments for Google till I joined a well-known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (company change), and eventually found an opportunity to move to India (location change) as an investor.\n\nWith that, we can now move on to:\n\nSo far, you\u2019ve understood: where you want to move, when you want to move, and how to think about a long-term career roadmap which will inform the right conditions for a move.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example of a founder in the US who wants to move to India to build an India-focused company. The conditions she might care most about \u2014 assuming there is just no personal angle to her decision \u2014 are: can she build a product that Indians will use/buy; does she have the right network to build a solid consumer / enterprise product team in India; and does she have the right connections to raise capital in India.\n\nThese conditions are weighted below as per her preferences, i.e., skewed completely towards the professional.\n\nThe trick here is to really understand what you are moving back for and then being extra flexible on everything else.\n\nFor me it was 60% personal, 40% professional and my evaluation matrix took those weights under consideration.\n\nProfessionally, fit with the team was paramount, followed by how much autonomy I will get in the new role, whether this is a team that\u2019s thinking big and is betting their careers on, and what my trusted sources say about the firm. Personally, the jump had to satisfy a certain salary minimum and a location close to my family.\n\nNote that you will get stuck at this stage if you set too high a score for yourself or are not honest about your reasons for the move. Also note that the framework still works if, say, you have to move back because your family needs you urgently \u2014 your evaluation matrix simply puts most of its weight on the personal in that case.\n\nOnce you have done this exercise, you can move to the fifth and final framework: the opportunity evaluation matrix.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, congratulations: you have multiple roles on the table and you now need to stack-rank them based on your conditions to make the jump. At this point, you know where to jump to (framework #1), when to jump (framework #2), how does this fit into the bigger picture (framework #3), and what criteria are needed to pull the trigger (framework #4). The evaluation matrix framework helps you pick one of the multiple options you may have in front of you.\n\nHere\u2019s a hypothetical example below to help you think through it. All you need now is a weighted average score per role. For the example below, for job#1, the way you find the total score is:\n\nAt the end of this exercise, you need to do a gut-check. Once you learn which job# won out, evaluate whether you feel excited or surprised or disappointed.\n\nIn the above example, job#3 wins, but by a small margin over job#1. Job#3 probably means you won\u2019t be as close to your family as you want, but this role has more autonomy, a little better salary, and is going after a far bigger bet. If you still feel jittery about your call, you have probably not been honest about your criteria or the weights.\n\nIndia is an incredible growth story that\u2019s still early in the making and being there now is going to be invigorating, satisfying, but also frustrating if you haven\u2019t thought through the whys and the whens properly. I hope these frameworks can help you understand objectively your path for the next few years and, if you are an Indian living abroad, I hope that path leads you back to India!\n\nI\u2019d love to connect with anyone who is (1) a founder or an industry veteran with an India connection/interest (2) an investor with an interest in India or (3) anyone who wants to spend time helping indian companies grow or expand to the US!

        "text": "I\u2019m in the middle of an interview.\n\nAcross the table from me sits a girl who wants to join our marketing team. And her CV looks pretty great:\n\nAs my colleagues ask her questions, I realize I\u2019m staring at her CV as if it were a blank sheet of paper.\n\nHer education, her work experience, her people skills \u2014 these aren\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nI\u2019ve been through dozens of interviews, and seen dozens of CVs just like this one.\n\nI raise my eyes and say the same thing that I\u2019ve said to the candidates that came before her.\n\nOK: I know this might sound like I\u2019m behaving like a total ass.\n\nBut this is precisely how I hired the last two (brilliant) members of our Customer Support team \u2014 who have already started their transition to marketing.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not some psychological test. I\u2019m not trying to work out whether a person\u2019s dedicated enough to start from the bottom and work their way up.\n\nI simply want all members of my marketing team to have the same experience I did. The experience that got me to where I am today.\n\nThree years ago I was hired by Ahrefs. Soon after, I moved to their headquarters in Singapore.\n\n\u201cProduct Marketing Director\u201d was written on my work visa.\n\nBut despite my pompous title, which implied that I should be in charge of a big team, there was only one person that I had to manage: myself.\n\nAnd I was out of my depth.\n\nAhrefs was a newcomer to a very competitive market of SEO tools. The landscape was dominated by widely-known Goliaths like Moz and SEMrush, who had dozens of people in their well-oiled marketing departments.\n\nThey\u2019d been industry leaders for years, continually expanding their brand and growing their reputation.\n\nHell, almost everything I knew about SEO was from the Moz blog. Now I was up against them. Alone.\n\nAnd now, I had to fill all these gaps. As soon as possible.\n\nSo, I dug into every little detail of our product, comparing features and functionality to competitive solutions.\n\nI read hundreds of articles. I reached out to industry leaders whenever I saw the opportunity. I made it my daily mission to learn everything I could about the SEO niche.\n\nBut most importantly, I started talking to our customers.\n\nI answered queries in our support chat every day. I made sure my email address was easy to find. I encouraged everyone and anyone to drop me a line, anytime.\n\nI was active on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Inbound.org and plenty of other social sites where our target customers were hanging out.\n\nOne thing sticks in my memory in particular. This Reddit thread I posted shortly after joining Ahrefs:\n\nThe thread blew up with comments. It turned out we had a lot of customers who wanted to connect with us and give their opinions, but were never given a proper chance to.\n\nI can\u2019t say I loved hearing EVERYTHING they had to say. But I learned a ton that day; both about our product and about being its \u201cofficial representative.\u201d\n\nIn other words, my job was an all-rounder: customer support representative, salesperson, PR. I threw myself in at the deep end and found myself completely immersed.\n\nAnd digesting all that knowledge \u2014 feedback, industry news, product-market fit \u2014 was crucial in understanding how Ahrefs needed to be marketed.\n\nIt helped me write the copy for our homepage; choose a direction for our blog; and easily surpass 1M views on our YouTube channel.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the reasons we were able to grow our 8-figure ARR by +65% two years straight.\n\nThree years on, I hope I live up to the \u201cProduct Marketing Director\u201d title still written on my work visa.\n\nToday, I manage a team of eight people (plus a bunch of freelance contractors), and most of my daily schedule has changed.\n\nBut one thing stays the same: I keep as close to our customers as possible.\n\nI answer all the emails that I receive from them; I talk to them in our private Facebook group; and I belong to several marketing communities on Slack, jumping in whenever people discuss Ahrefs.\n\nAnd I think it pays off.\n\nOh, and last year I posted the same thread on the same Subreddit:\n\nLuckily, it went much more smoothly this time round; I was even given some Reddit gold.\n\nPerhaps this all sounds painfully obvious to you. But it wasn\u2019t always to me.\n\nIncorporating multiple roles into one at the beginning meant I was forced to learn quickly; this might not have been the case if I\u2019d cruised into the marketing department with tons of support and no baseline knowledge.\n\nAnd if this knowledge makes you truly believe in your product, you become an even greater marketer; marketing genuinely and honestly, without ever having to \u2018trick\u2019 people.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also loads to learn about the art and science of marketing, from psychological triggers and patterns to technical hacks and analytics.\n\nBut you can\u2019t apply all this knowledge effectively without knowing exactly what you\u2019re applying it to, and believing you\u2019re giving people the best possible option there is.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one who thinks customer service is an effective entry point into another departments.\n\nCustomer experience aficionados like Zappos and MailChimp built a similar strategy into their onboarding program; Roadmunk puts all their new employees on customer support for the first two weeks.\n\nIn fact, some companies believe every member of staff should be trained in customer support.\n\nSo, if I hired a new candidate for our marketing team tomorrow \u2014 no matter how talented they were \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have any work to give them.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t review the copy on our website; write an article for our blog; run ads. Nothing.\n\nA candidate can have all the experience in the world, but they don\u2019t have experience with your brand.\n\nAnd nothing is more detrimental than when different departments lack a cohesive understanding of a company\u2019s vision, customers and product.\n\nBut, by putting them on the front line first, they form an emotional connection with users, develop empathy towards their problems and gain a much deeper understanding of the product: what we offer, how it works, our history, our future.\n\nThey transform their mind to align with customer thinking.\n\nTalking to users is the most effective way to learn. How better to understand the customer experience than to go through it yourself?\n\nExposure to customers early on creates a central understanding and a well-oiled machine. It\u2019s the only way to become a valuable member of the marketing team.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the only way to stay valuable.\n\nThis is my fifth post on Medium. Let me know what you think \u2014 you can say hello here.\n\nFor more in-depth marketing articles, feel free to check out our blog and try Ahrefs 7-day trial."

Dreams like most people lives are not monotonous and help the dreamers get out of that box and see the world differently, in a new perspective.\n\nIf you are an artist, then dreams are a crucial tool in your tool-set. You\u2019ll get ideas that can\u2019t be thought of.\n\nIf problems are troubling you, chances are a solution is already there but you are unable to see it. Dreams show the solutions in unique ways if only you pay attention.\n\nExperiences like these go a long way in helping you and making you a better person.\n\nMovies entertain us and we love them. In those two hours, we live protagonist entire life, relishing every moment of that larger than life experience. Dreams are all that and much more. For a start, you are a protagonist (more often than not). You experience situations and emotions that you can never imagine.\n\nMost mornings you will feel you have lived an entire life in those timeless hours. All that experiences can be incorporated into waking life if you pay attention to them and accept them as real.\n\nDreams sometimes are like portals channelling Transcendental Knowledge from beyond, unhindered by self-limiting ego. Messages from the subconscious, come in various forms like extraordinary vistas, godly figures, people you adore and are no more, mysterious recurrent figures you don\u2019t know, guiding celestial announcements.\n\nIt was an overwhelming experience to hear this in my dream. Being present there and seeing the magnificent enactment of the words made it much more special.\n\nThe information that you get from these proclamations are not what you want but what you need.

        "text": "Unveiling the Secrets Behind Our Magical Mixed Reality Demo at TED 2018 A detailed and technical overview of how we were able to create one of the world\u2019s most spatially accurate mixed reality experiences for TED 2018\n\nThere are three rules that every magician swears by:\n\nThankfully, we\u2019re technologists, and we believe in sharing knowledge so more people can innovate and develop more awesome experiences. But in a way, technologists are like magicians. We sometimes make the impossible possible and instill wonder and awe to our audience.\n\nLast week at TED 2018, we did just that.\n\nWe unveiled one of the most spatially accurate mixed reality experiences the world has seen. By using Occipital\u2019s depth-sensing camera and their mixed reality framework, we were able to make our audience believe that the virtual objects are real and are, in fact, interacting with real-world objects.\n\nWhen we watch a movie with amazing visual effects, we tend to immerse ourselves in that world and willingly accept fiction as reality. This willingness is called suspension of disbelief.\n\nWith our demo, we made sure the mixed reality experience is as real as it could be. Things like the casting of virtual shadows, hiding virtual objects behind the physical set piece, and aligning the virtual experience to the physical model with less than 1mm spatial accuracy all made the TED attendees feel like they were looking through a magical lens into another world.\n\nCheck out the demo below. Notice how we were able to cast the shadow of the UFO onto the table and hide the virtual water behind the physical canyon. As the camera moves, the experience stays intact and locks to the physical model so the viewer can enjoy the experience from all angles.\n\nThe physical model is a replica of a part of the Grand Canyon called Horseshoe Bend. We made it with 33 layers of 3/8 sanded plywood cut on a CNC router.\n\nWe took the physical topography data of that section with the terrain view on Google Maps. The topography chart had lines marking height changes of the canyon. We then traced out each of these markers into separate layers in Photoshop and used live trace to convert them into vector files.\n\nThese vectors get converted into G Code for the CNC router through a program called V-Carve Pro. Once converted, the CNC router took about 3 hours to cut all the layers. Each layer was then sanded, glued and nailed in place.\n\nThe 3D canyon was made by using a satellite geological map of the actual site. We took the colored layers into Photoshop and extruded them into 3D layers. The software also allows OBJ extraction. Exporting from Photoshop, we took the 3D canyon, in slabs, to Autodesk Maya. From there, we could start to add other virtual objects like the UFO and the monster. This digital model was vital to creating a super spatially accurate mixed reality experience.\n\nAnimating for Unity can be done with Unity Animator, or in Maya and get exported to Unity using the \u201cSend to Unity\u201d feature. For this experience, we started animating in Autodesk Maya, but later we had to re-animate in Unity because of the interactions between the characters.\n\nOne extra challenge we had to deal with, was the world placement of the level. Usually, a scene is placed in 0,0,0 (x, y z). For this project, it was necessary to have the level placed and matched with its physical surrounding; meaning, the scene was moved from 0,0,0 (x, y, z) to a new location in space, pre-defined by virtual markers, to match the physical to digital stage alignment.\n\nEarly in the design phase, we wanted a solution that could give us the best possible mixed reality experience, but also portable and accessible to a crowd. One of the key technical requirements was showing occlusions, where virtual objects can hide behind real world objects. Our project lead, Aaron Hilton (Steampunk Digital) is actively involved in the development of Occipital\u2019s Bridge Engine, so we were able to use pre-release features for our MR experience.\n\nBridge is a mixed reality kit that includes a remote, headset, Structure Sensor, and the Bridge Engine SDK. It works to provide stereo mixed reality entirely powered by an iPhone. First, the user scans the space, generating an accurate 3D model of the world they wish to track on, and then activate the full Mixed Reality rendering mode that projects a live color image from the onboard camera. This live color projection gives the impression of depth even from a single RGB camera light source. Virtual objects can cast shadows on, bounce off of, and be covered up by real physical world surfaces, giving the user a full view of their surroundings.\n\nIn our case, we chose to use Bridge Engine with an iPad, using a standard Structure Sensor, bracket, and the optional wide vision lens. Once connected and calibrated, a Structure Sensor with a lens can see a wider field of view, improve its tracking precision, and function without the Bridge Headset, minus the stereo vision. Holding an iPad also meant that we would use the touch screen for input rather than using the remote control. We chose to keep the controls simple, tapping the screen was suitable for minimizing the learning curve of newcomers and help to demonstrate the live interaction.\n\nWe experimented with different shaders to simulate occlusion, experimented with many different materials for water, and Physical-Based Rendering (PBR) materials optimized to run with a linear color space. The interactions were built with a combination of C# scripting, Unity Mechanim state machines and animation tracks with event triggers. The final package is generated by Unity, converting C# into a low-level C++ intermediate with project files, and finally built into an iOS app by XCode. We also modified the starting behavior of the native Objective-C bootstrap code, so that we could enter debug settings and do scanning, but hide the debug settings once the scan was completed.\n\nWe experimented with different Bridge Engine settings optimizing for best effect and enhanced tracking robustness. We used mono mode for the iPad experience, which allows the live color pass through of unscanned areas. Normally stereo mode masks off the live color wherever there is no scanned geometry, however mono can show all of the color cameras without masking. We also used ambient lighting adjustments, to color-match the temperature of the surrounding lighting changes to match what the human eyes see to what the Bridge Engine renders.\n\nCreating a deployable experience was also required, where a digital version of the model had to be precisely aligned with the physical model. We took great care in the design and fabrication process to make sure the digital and physical versions were equivalent, scale accurate copies.\n\nIn Unity we built a virtual \u201cStage\u201d that contained the digital model. We dressed up the digital model with all the visual elements we wanted in the experience.\n\nDuring development, we took an environment scan from a playthrough with Bridge Engine and transferred the scan off the iPad back into Unity. This way we could rapidly prototype what it would be like to place the \u201cStage\u201d into a real-world environment without going through the full build process.\n\nFor alignment on-site, we first considered using fiducial markers that could be detected and calculate the alignment. However, as development progressed, we developed a unique key-point alignment system that was also remarkably easy to use in practice. It works by placing two feature points that align the digital and physical versions together in a pseudo mixed-reality VR mode, then we switch over to pure mixed reality and finish the alignment. The final alignment is done by holding a controller button down while physically moving about the model, and the virtual model follows at 1:10 ratio, moving slowly compared to the physical motion of the camera.\n\nThis alignment technique worked simultaneously in all 6-degrees of motion; position (x, y, z), and rotation (pitch-yaw-roll), and worked so incredibly intuitively. We could see wherever the digital \u201cWater\u201d leaked through the physical canyon model and make subtle adjustments to get a precise fit.\n\nOn the day of our big reveal at TED, we were very excited to share our experience with the VIPs. We scanned the whole area including the walls, drapes, table, and narrowed in for a few key frames of the canyon itself. The virtual water fits perfectly in alignment of the physical canyon walls and tracking was super stable.\n\nAs TED VIP\u2019s came to check out the experience, they were able to enjoy a god-like perspective and watch the story unfold from all angles. Many were impressed by the variety of virtual objects such as trees, rocks, bridges and animals and how they were able to occlude or stay aligned with the physical model. Experts in the AR space were also impressed by our demonstration of hiding virtual objects behind physical one(occlusion), casting of shadows on to real-world objects, and tracking of the experience.\n\nAs the curtains fell, our TED experience came to an end. It was truly an honor to participate in \u201cThe Age of Amazement,\u201d and we can\u2019t wait to take this technology further.\n\nAt Shape Immersive, we believe Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality would be the next fundamental platform shift, supplanting the multi-touch interfaces of today. This idea of blending virtual worlds with physical ones opens up an entirely new frontier in which our experiences will be extended in ways we could have never imagined.\n\nWhen AR devices become more ubiquitous, the demand for spatial data will increase exponentially. We believe blockchain technology can help make spatial data universally accessible so that anyone can create scalable and persistent AR experiences.\n\nI would like to give a huge shoutout to the team-Aaron Hilton (Steampunk Digital), June Kim & Michael Yagudaev (Nano3Labs), Amir Tamadon (VRSquare), Jeffrey Jang & Jonathan Andrews (Immersive Tech) for bringing this vision to reality in 4 short weeks, my investor Victory Square Technologies for supporting us from day 1 and TED and VRARA (Vancouver) for giving us the opportunity.\n\nWe will continue to demonstrate why spatial data is important for amazing AR experiences at Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara (May 31-June1). Come check us out!\n\nWe are building a decentralized marketplace that will make spatial data universally accessible so anyone can create scalable and persistent Augmented Reality experiences.\n\nCheck out our website here: www.shapeimmersive.com"

At this point, the future of the platform hinges on whether it can regain trust. Otherwise, the social media giant might face the ultimate consequence of more users abandoning the platform.\n\nTo do so, Facebook will have to take a hard look at its business model. Until the company can move away from an ad-driven business model (which accounts for 90 percent of revenue), it will continue to make people\u2019s data available to advertisers and potentially bad agents.\n\nThe obvious solution is making Facebook a paid service \u2014 according to Sheryl Sandberg, if you want to use the platform ad-free, you would have to pay for it.\n\nBut a subscription-based model is by far the least interesting way to monetize its platform.\n\nInstead, consider these six less obvious ways Facebook can make money while keeping your data out of the hands of advertisers:\n\nOne of the things that keeps us coming back to Facebook is the ability to connect with friends and family \u2014 to see their updates and communicate with them directly. What if, instead of a mobile newsfeed, we could enter a virtual world and interact with avatar profiles of friends and family?\n\nIn that way, Facebook would finally be able to make better use of its VR headset, Oculus Rift, and sell to people other than a niche of extreme gamers.\n\nWhat if Facebook sold subscriptions for streaming movies and TV shows? Facebook is in a great position to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\nFor one, it wouldn\u2019t need to advertise, so cost of acquisition would be virtually zero. More importantly, they could differentiate with unrivaled content discovery. Using its liking and sharing features, Facebook is already providing recommendations of live and recorded content in categories like \u201cMost Talked About,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Making People Laugh,\u201d and \u201cShows Your Friends Are Watching.\u201d\n\nFacebook could take streaming content to the next level, making it difficult for Netflix and the likes to keep up.\n\nFacebook can also continue to push the boundaries on the devices we use. According to a Facebook post from Zuckerberg from last year:\n\nA brain-computer interface, as creepy as it sounds, could definitely blow any current Apple or Samsung product out of the water.\n\nFacebook would fare well if it adopted Amazon\u2019s business model \u2014 building a full e-commerce experience on top of its social network and use data to curate a personalized shopping experience.\n\nRetailers could build inventory within Facebook\u2019s \u201cshopping\u201d platform and product recommendations would be made to each user based on their interest. Brands wouldn\u2019t even need to advertise; if you chose to shop using Facebook, you would automatically receive a \u201cfor you\u201d curation. Brands would then have to pay a premium fee for each transaction, and the unparalleled personalization would presumably generate incredibly high conversion rates.\n\nFacebook is currently developing ways to make affordable internet access possible in communities around the world with Internet.org; exploring possibilities with high-altitude long-endurance planes, satellites and lasers.\n\nAssuming Internet.org can succeed in creating it\u2019s own stabilized data network, conventional telecom companies (i.e. Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T) wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nNot only would the costs for data plans pale in comparison, but it could create a market for extremely affordable messaging-only devices using Messenger and WhatsApp, the two most used messaging apps on the planet (which Facebook owns).\n\nWhat if Facebook leveraged blockchain technology to decentralize the storage of your data and paid you if you allowed brands to access it?\n\nYou could control whether you wanted to allow others to access your social data. If you chose to allow advertisers to access your data, you would be paid using a cryptocurrency created by Facebook.\n\nFacebook would scale its value as the cryptocurrency appreciated and, using public ledgers, you could then track exactly where and how your data was being used."

        "title": "$0 to $10 Million \u2014 6 Tips To SKYROCKET Your Sales Career",
        "text": "It took nearly 4 years to scale my previous startup (a YouTube talent management agency) from zero dollars in sales to over $10,000,000 in sales.\n\nWe didn\u2019t do it by raising boatloads of VC funding.\n\nWe didn\u2019t do it by advertising (we never spent a dollar on paid traffic).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do it by having a fancy office (our entire sales team worked remotely).\n\nWe did it by picking up the phone and making sales call after sales call.\n\nI tell you this not to brag about our startup\u2019s success, but to make clear that anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to put in long hours, experiment with new strategies, and are not afraid to fail.\n\nHere are six tactical sales tips that you can start implementing today to start making more sales.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed a sales call (regardless if it was successful or not), take a minute to follow-up with your prospect via email.\n\nThe simple act of thanking someone for their time shows that you\u2019re a professional and leaves a positive impression in your prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nFor example, here are some example follow-up templates you can start using today:\n\nIn a recent post about 5 Phrases That Kill Trust In Sales (recommended read), we took a look at some phrases that may be costing you deals.\n\nFor example, phrases such as \u201cAs far as I know, \u2026\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure \u2026\u201d and \u201cTo the best of my recollection \u2026\u201d all share one deal-killing trait: Uncertainty.\n\nThese phrases breed distrust with your prospects because they demonstrate that you\u2019re not certain about what you represent.\n\nThe bottom line: To sell more, show certainty.\n\nWhen speaking with your prospect, speak with the individual on a first-name basis.\n\nAs strange as this tip may sound, I\u2019ve found this to be one of the most helpful pieces of advice for building trust and rapport.\n\nIf your prospect has a difficult-to-pronounce name, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for clarification on how it\u2019s pronounced.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a person who does not know how to read and a person who chooses not to read?\n\nWhen you start closing sales and begin to build momentum in your career, it\u2019s easy to mistakenly think that you \u201cdon\u2019t need to learn more\u201d.\n\nBut before you can improve your life, you first have to go to work on yourself.\n\nReading material from articles like this, or from sales books, on a daily basis will provide you with fresh ideas and strategies that you can start immediately implementing.\n\nSuccessful people focus on what they can control.\n\nUnsuccessful people dwell on what they can\u2019t control.\n\nThis breaks down into two actionable steps:\n\nStep 1): Isolate your short list of \u201chigh value\u201d activities (never more than six items) that will create the greatest impact for you.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a real estate agent, you likely have three key activities:\n\nKnocking on doors, cold calling prospects (homeowners looking to sell), and showing listings.\n\nStep 2): Once you\u2019ve isolated your key activities, the next thing to do is to start tracking your performance in these key areas (preferably in a dedicated paper journal).\n\nUsing our real estate agent example, your journal entry is likely to look something like this:\n\nOne of the best investments that you can make is purchasing a $0.50 paper journal to log your sales calls.\n\nEssentially, a notebook that you can utilize to keep track of each and every sales call that you make (a \u201csales journal\u201d).\n\nFor example, an entry into your sales journal can look like this:\n\nGreat salespeople are able to compartmentalize their life and not bring their emotions into discussions.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make sales calls when your commission cash flow is strong, your sales pipeline is full, and your clients are calling to give you referrals.\n\nVirtually everyone can sustain enthusiasm on \u201csunny days\u201d.\n\nBut to be successful in sales, you must sustain your desire to do well on the \u201cgrey days\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m referring to the days where the sun isn\u2019t shining, your cash flow is weak, your sales pipeline is empty, and half of your prospects just left for your competitor\u2019s company.\n\nSuccess in sales requires you to leave your emotions at the door and to bring a refreshed positive mental attitude to each and every prospecting opportunity that you encounter.\n\nSo, now that you have these seven tactical tips, what is your plan for taking action?"

        "title": "If you want to be a good leader, live these 4 principles",
        "text": "A colleague asked me this question at a team event fairly recently.\n\nI was confident in my response because I had laboured over for years on the degree of impact my/team leadership had on the realisation of goals dreamt years ago.\n\nWe had grown rapidly for years and I knew that I was doing something right but couldn\u2019t boil it down to it\u2019s essence. Then, a few years ago, I was at a Tony Robbins event where it struck me that I/our team was living the principles that he often talks about.\n\nNot positive or negative but as they are. People usually fall into two camps: Glass half full or glass half empty.\n\nThe glass half empty camp looks at the world cynically \u2014 \u201cthings are never going to be better around here\u201d. These are people that you should avoid \u2014 I know because I used to be one of them. I had role models who were cynical and responded to new ideas with a snarky comment \u2014 \u201cUtterly uncool to try this new idea because it won\u2019t work\u201d\u2026 and it is devastating to effect any type of change.\n\nThe glass half full camp looks at the world optimistically \u2014 \u201cthings aren\u2019t bad, they are actually wonderful and for the the stuff that doesn\u2019t work, we will vision board the heck out of it\u201d. I swung my pendulum from the cynical side to this side but slowly realised that there always remained an incongruence between reality and the optimistic version which wasn\u2019t healthy. Plus, one can never tell if things can get better because everything is pretty good to begin with. Ironically, wide-eyed enthusiast and a sceptic may end up achieving similar results. That said, I\u2019d rather have an optimist on the team than a sceptic because coming into work is easy.\n\nI have always looked for the buddhist \u201cmiddle way\u201d to bring disparate viewpoints together. In this case, the third way is that the glass is both half full and half empty at the same time and that is truly pragmatic.\n\nTranslated to leadership, the first principle is where you recognise the strengths and your weaknesses and your landscape. You aren\u2019t irrationally optimist or pessimist but pragmatic.\n\nThis becomes all the more important in the startup world because your glass in a startup world is truly not half full but perhaps 1/8th full. You have some strengths and you have a number of weaknesses. Too often startups make mistakes because they either over-estimate their strengths \u201cour key recipe is our secret algorithm that will make us successful\u201d or under-estimate their weaknesses \u201cwe don\u2019t need sales yet because our customer success team will create the necessary virality\u201d.\n\nUnless you have the capability to realistically assess where you are it is difficult to go to where you need to be. This brings me to principle #2.\n\nEssentially, know where the summit is where the flag has to be posted.\n\nWhy are you here in this businesses? You saw where things are and you know how to improve them. You have defined your why and you will start your journey to the summit. Some entrepreneurs do this very well but most are rather optimistic \u201cwe will change the world\u201d \u2026 by bringing in app that sends a \u201cyo\u201d to someone-else \u2014 you get the point! This is why principle #1 is important comes before #2 to bring in pragmatism. As a leader, it is your responsibility to keep the audacious goals in the realm of achievability \u2014 usually this is backed by your domain and market expertise.\n\nThe eye-on-the-summit all the time is an important skill because others on your team won\u2019t see it or believe it. I was often met with an incredulous look when I would call out the summit. Gradually, I learnt that some people cannot handle the summit height when they are at the base of the mountain and you have to break the summit down into series of milestones. I put people into circles and chose to expose the level of milestones, the summit or even multiple summits based on their capability to digest this information without freaking out."

        "text": "There\u2019s no arguing that social media is one of the most effective marketing tool you have- paid or organic. So why wouldn\u2019t you utilize it for promoting your event?\n\nThere are four phases of event promotion you\u2019ll go through when using social media and it\u2019s important that they all work together.\n\nTo ticket or not to ticket a free event may seem like a discussion, but there really isn\u2019t one. In most cases, you\u2019re better off \u201cticketing\u201d, even if it only involves people entering their email to RSVP and zero physical tickets.\n\nThere are plenty of options to utilize for ticketing, the main three being Eventbrite, Facebook, or through your website. With integrations, you can make all three possible and still have all your data consolidated in Eventbrite. The best ticketing solution I\u2019ve found is doing exactly such. I set up an Eventbrite page for my event, build a Facebook event and link them, allowing people to register for tickets right through Facebook. Then I embed the Eventbrite code on my website page as well, to ensure I capture all possible traffic.\n\nCapitalizing on pre-event hype is the best way to encourage meaningful participation and event attendance.\n\nStart with a dedicated hashtag for your event. Include this on all ticketing pages and in every social media post about the event. Add it to graphics too. Monitor use of your hashtag and start conversations with people organically using it.\n\nEncourage people to tweet out their registration (with the hashtag of course) by including a \u201cClick to Tweet\u201d button on your website. This 1.) gets word out to their audience 2.) further reinforces that this event is worth bragging about.\n\nShare speaker bios & headshots on social media leading up the event. Share recent happenings if relevant. Encourage your speakers to share the event on their own social media as much as possible.\n\nIf this is an annual event \u2014 or if you have run a similar event in the past \u2014 share photos and videos from past events for #throwbackthrusday as the event approaches. Encourage your audience to share their own photos from past events (with the hashtag!) as well.\n\nEncouraging your audience to provide their input will not only give you insight as to their thoughts, but also encourages excitement because they\u2019ll feel like they\u2019re participating in decisions directly.\n\nLive tweeting is probably my top life skill, so I always prioritize it in my event coverage. It makes it easy for your attendees and speakers to retweet to their audience (so they don\u2019t have to write their own tweet) and it helps your online audience feel like they\u2019re actually there, while inducing a hint of #FOMO.\n\nLive streaming can have the same result, but is more difficult. For this to be successful and appear polished, it is necessary to have an individual person walking around doing nothing but streaming. Juggling streaming, posting elsewhere, and taking pictures is nearly impossible to do at all, let alone do and have a positive outcome. IT is better tho not live stream, than to live stream poorly.\n\nDuring the actual event is also the best time to utilize user-generated content (UGC). Retweet posters (hopefully using your hashtag) real time. You will be showing your audience there are people at your event enjoying it while at the same time creating an incentive for people to share photos.\n\nEncourage your presenters to be active on social media throughout the event when they are not presenting."

        "text": "While reading \u201cTribe of Mentors\u201d by Timothy Ferriss, I was intrigued by many of the game changers he interviewed. Specifically, I was fascinated with Jocko Willink. Jocko was a former Navy Seal and current game changer. His ideas around self discipline were so incredible I wanted to share some of his insight with you as well.\n\nJocko takes a unique approach in stating that everyone wants freedom, yet very few people are willing to work for their freedom. Simply put \u2014 you get out of something what you put into it.\n\nFrom this, I want you to think about your level of discipline in the following areas of your life by honestly asking yourself these three questions:\n\nAre you measuring up to YOUR own standards?\n\nDo you have a diligent practice of discipline in each area?\n\nAre you weaker in certain areas? If so, how will you improve?\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack these specific areas of discipline.\n\nThis is probably the most obvious of areas where freedom can come; at the cost of saving now. Many people do not fully grasp this concept and instead find themselves saying they want to be financially free yet do not spend what is necessary to have finances which are legendary.\n\nFour times a week I run at 6am. Do I ALWAYS enjoy it? Absolutely not. However, investing in my physical health now will give me the freedom of more healthy years later in my life. In fact, running 1\u20131.5 hours per week can add about 5\u20136 years to your life. Heart health is wealth, yet many people today suffer from chronic health disease which could have been avoided through years of investment in physical activity by investing in the physical.\n\nIf you are not spending at least 1 hour per day reading, you are not going to be intellectually free. If you read 1 hour per day for five years that is 1,825 hours of reading. Sharpening the intellectual saw is the only way to become intellectually feee. That comes with intentional discipline and effort. Books do not read themselves\u2026.yet.\n\n\u201cTake the 8:15 to the city\u201d \u2014 The Guess Who\n\nIf you want to create the professional freedom you want, you will need to be taking the 6:15 to the city and don\u2019t expect to retire to the TV following dinner. Professional freedom in refining your craft takes time, energy and enthusiasm for greatness. It will take energy and discipline in your fringe hours to create magic and to become professionally free."

        "title": "Why Chatbots are Just a Fad, but AI is Here to Stay",
        "text": "Placing all of your product focus on chatbots for the long haul is a recipe for disaster when you think of the purpose they serve. A chatbot is mostly just a visual courier of inputs and outputs between a user and some form of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Mobile apps were the hot fad before chatbots and websites before that. They\u2019re all just visual representations of how we take user input and provide an output in return that is of value to the user.\n\nMobile apps surpassed websites due to the shift from PCs to mobile devices and the fact that mobile apps provide a more efficient user experience or at least they\u2019re supposed to. Chatbots are currently gaining ground on mobile apps due in large part to the surge in popularity of messaging platforms and the convenience and familiarity that chatbots can provide to the users of these platforms. This is a natural shift in the way we get value from technology that is driven by efficiency and in some cases hype.\n\nIf chatbots are just a visual UI fad then what is actually generating all of the value and hype that is causing the chatbot space to become so hot? The answer is easy. It\u2019s the data and the AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities that turn the data into real value for the user.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s think of an AI-driven platform designed to aid in providing tech support. As more and more users engage with the platform to troubleshoot issues, it collects valuable data regarding the symptoms and resolution of the issues. As this data aggregates over time, it provides more fuel for the AI, ML, and NLP to use to generate true value and automation for the user.\n\nIn this scenario, the AI can leverage the collection of issue-related data to present the user with the optimal troubleshooting steps. The chatbot would merely be the transporter of the user\u2019s input in the form of issue symptoms and the AI\u2019s output in the form of an ideal resolution.\n\nChatbots are the trendy representation of AI capabilities at the moment, but you could argue that voice UI is right there with them and that augmented reality-based AI is bound to surpass both in the future. The visual representation of AI capabilities to users is going to be subject to change for the foreseeable future as we continue to discover superior ways of handling this flow of inputs and outputs.\n\nWhat\u2019s not about to change for the worse is the potential that AI has on technology and its impact on our everyday lives. The ability to collect mass amounts of user data and make intelligent technology-driven decisions based on macro-analysis of this data is an inherently powerful concept that is driving the modern technological innovations.\n\nSo when it comes to devising a vision for your product and the value proposition for your users don\u2019t focus on the visual UI aka the chatbot. Instead, focus on the data you can collect and what you can do with that data via AI, ML, and NLP to provide groundbreaking value and genuinely innovative experiences for your users.\n\nBy focusing on the core competency that is driving your value proposition, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to pivot to the latest and greatest UI trend that is sweeping the user landscape. Otherwise, don\u2019t be surprised if your chatbot-driven focus results in your once exciting product becoming as extinct as the dinosaurs."

        "text": "I made a simplified explanation of the market cycle of ICOs as they do experience this as well. I believe this is interesting for thinking about your future crypto investments in general. Let me know what you think. Information is provided by this awesome guy: Crypto Trading Bullshit Guy.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a brand new coin and give it ticker (BNC) for easier reference. Let\u2019s say BNC is a new blockchain currency with super-private, lightning fast transactions, growing community and a small yet active and competent developer group.\n\nAfter being traded just on some super shady exchanges (let\u2019s call it Yobit) BNC gets listed on Kucoin.\n\nThe word about BNC gets around on /r/cryptocurrency, Bitcointalk, /biz/ etc. Early investors looking for nice small cap projects notice that it\u2019s a promising project well below 20 mil USD market cap and start buying the coin.\n\nSome traders who use technical analysis notice that the volume on BNC grew considerably and find out that other indicators are quite bullish so they start buying it.\n\nNow the coins get shilled for all the wrong reasons, people start talking about its gains. The FOMO machine turns on and lots of greed pours into the system. By now, everyone is buying (think of XRB).\n\nIn the last and the most important stage of the bull run the stupidest market participants jump aboard the train. The coin has already grown 20x after the Kucoin listing and forums are full of BNC-to-the-moon memes. New guys are convinced it is a good investment based on its past performance and the parabolic trajectory (\u201cThis coin never goes down, I\u2019m holding it for five years until my initial five dollar investment grows to five million!\u201d)\n\nBut smart money (the early investors and traders) already know one thing \u2014 the market is heavily overbought and has no space to grow. It is a good coin but it is years from massive adoption (so is Bitcoin) and since it is becoming obvious that the price must go down why not buy more at much lower prices? And they start selling.\n\nThey, of course, cannot sell all their holdings at once or they\u2019ll bring the price down so they sell just a part of their holdings to the FOMO-ing masses.\n\nThe price drops a bit but the hype is strong and many dumb FOMOs see this as a great opportunity to jump in (they heard somewhere to buy the dip).\n\nThe price goes up a bit but still below ATH, the smart money knows what that means and they sell more. And since the coins parabolic trajectory is broken FOMO sentiment is slowly turning into FUD. So fewer people are buying the dip and the price bounces just a bit and then goes further down.\n\nHowever, the smart guys know that there\u2019s still some juice to be sucked out of this coin (and they still haven\u2019t fully unloaded the bags so they don\u2019t want the price to drop too fast) so they buy more and the price once again recovers a bit.\n\nBut the market is now in an obvious bear mode so smart guys use the small price surge to unload as much as they can. Now, price action is painting long red candles and the market is in full panic mode. Everybody is trying to get out as soon as possible and forums are screaming that BNC is a scam and a major shitcoin.\n\nSmart guys notice the market is massively oversold and that the price is not far from their original entry price so they are once again buying. And thus the new cycle begins.\n\nThanks to Maca_Najeznica for allowing me to republish this. \n\nFollow his Twitter for more cool crypto updates."

        "text": "Why It\u2019s a Good Idea to Listen to Opposing Views.\n\nTo be unbiased means to show no prejudice for or against something; to be impartial. So, I guess let\u2019s talk about why it\u2019s so hard to be unbiased.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain pride inside all of us. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cyeah but I\u2019m really not prideful in any way\u201d, then think about something you\u2019re good at. Once you have that, imagine someone critiquing and criticizing it.\n\nHow do you feel now? You might feel like you have a chip on your shoulder or a reason to prove somebody wrong. That\u2019s your pride swelling. There\u2019s of course, as with anything, good and bad to your pride swelling.\n\nBut what gives us that feeling? Why am I so hung up on proving to you that a Ford is just a better oiled machine than a Chevy, or vice versa? Why does Walmart suck? Does anyone even know?\n\nI remember a fellow student telling me a while back that Walmart put food on the table when she was growing up. Her mom worked there and the steady paycheck took care of them. So, without listening to her story, would I have been able to see the good?\n\nChallenging a bias is one of the most frustrating experiences you will endure. I try to do it often. There is nothing quite like the final resolve after the initial internal storm of thought and feelings. The reason I try to do it often is because I believe it\u2019s difficult to gain wisdom and growth as a person if you just believe the way you do without questioning how you came to that belief.\n\nNot to mention, without giving consideration to the opposing side of said belief. If someone told you a story about a homeless guy that wasn\u2019t really homeless, but he just held a cardboard sign at a busy corner because he knew he\u2019d get a lot of random cash, you probably wouldn\u2019t feel great about volunteering your time to the homeless population.\n\nIt might reinforce your belief that they\u2019re just \u201cbeggars\u201d hoping to score some drugs with fast cash. On the contrary, if someone told you a story of a homeless man that had a bachelor\u2019s degree but couldn\u2019t get a job and didn\u2019t have family to support him, so now he\u2019s on the street, you may be a bit more inclined to volunteer some of your time to help the population.\n\nEither way, to be sold entirely on one position or the other would be a little irresponsible. Frankly, you\u2019d be limiting yourself.\n\nLet\u2019s just pretend for a second that you think Chevy is better than Ford because that\u2019s what your best friend thinks. You trust your best friend. You know that he or she has ample knowledge of the way the components are manufactured and put together.\n\nWithout researching how the vehicle is made, this would mean that any conversation or argument you\u2019ve had with a wicked Ford supporter is based on your belief in the Chevy product because your best friend likes it.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could just win arguments like that? \u201cOh yeah, well you\u2019re wrong, because Timmy likes it\u201d, \u201cWait, what? Timmy likes Chevy? Ugh, man\u2026 can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been so wrong this whole time\u201d. I\u2019m using an overly simplified example but again, it\u2019s to support my belief that you have to do some research and know why you actually believe what you do for it to even hold water.\n\nDo you want to believe in something and perhaps stand for something that you haven\u2019t solidified soundly in your own mind? What if someone discredited Timmy by simply stating that he picks his nose? \u201cOh no, internal conflict\u2026 I hate nose-pickers! But Timmy likes Chevy! I\u2019m not sure I can like Chevy anymore\u201d.\n\nCognitive dissonance is a fascinating thing. We tend to flock toward our own opinions and beliefs. We like to only listen to what leaders and peers have to say in support of those areas because otherwise we\u2019ll be uncomfortable.\n\nThe problem is, once someone throws in there that Timmy picks his nose, we have to decide if that character flaw is going to sway us in another direction or if we can make the exception that although Timmy picks his nose, he still knows a lot about Chevy.\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to function in relationship with others if you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard it said quite interestingly in a college class I attended a long time ago. The professor pointed to the white wall in the room and he said, \u201cThis wall is green. It is. This is a green wall. I know you think it\u2019s white, but it\u2019s not\u201d, and he began shouting, \u201cThis wall is green!\u201d.\n\nHe actually did it for a while and it was kind of intense. But he got his point across. I know that the wall was white, but in the same way the wall was white to me, it was absolutely the greenest green to him.\n\nTo be intolerant of another viewpoint provides a huge disadvantage when it comes to being able to have any critical conversation. Have fun with the surface level he-said-she-said gossip, because that\u2019s about the extent of what your interactions will be diminished to if you choose to limit yourself to intolerance.\n\nThe moment you become convinced that you\u2019ve learned it all, is the moment you lose yourself to your pride. You\u2019ve now created a wall that limits your potential to understand another viewpoint.\n\nDo yourself a big favor. The next time you recognize a large bias that you possess, research something in support of the opposing view. It might take you a few tries to actually do it. It might hurt a little and make you cringe. But if you can just open your mind to it and be tolerant of the intolerance, you may find the growth you\u2019re looking for."

        "text": "I did it. I moved my website over to a new template. It\u2019s now more interactive and fluid than before. I decided on the move because my old website was too broad and spread out. With this new design the viewer can gain a snapshot impression in less than 30 seconds. It also gives me an opportunity to focus on the one skill I need my prospective employers to see: content creation.\n\nI enjoyed a nice experimentation phase of page-building through Wix in the past though it wasn\u2019t what others liked seeing. For my portfolio page I went super bland and to be honest it was a pretty dumb idea. Imagine if you were learning to code for the first time and used HTML with zero CSS.\n\nNow that my website has been revamped it is time to put those job applications out for my staffing agency\u2026 oh wait. I don\u2019t have any Problem-Solution-Results case studies to show. Let me think about that.\n\nIn content creation, a Problem-Solution-Results effort may look like this:\n\n1) Client is not getting traffic to its website.\n\n2) Create a blog on topics related to client services and products.\n\n1) Aspiring journalists are struggling to write quality articles to AP Style standards.\n\nNow for my least favorite part\u2026 measuring results. This could be tied into vanity metrics like \u201cLIKES\u201d on a page, or numerical statistics on viewer count / bounce rate. But now we are jumping into marketing territory with sales funnels, etc. Perhaps the most resonating piece of information is on engagement rate. If we can create a conversation with the user (say through the comments section in YouTube) then that creates a community to stand behind (or against) a company.\n\nThis is one of the many lessons I\u2019ve learned in creating content. Giving your viewer a reason to respond is paramount in driving the engagement rate.\n\nFor the record, an engagement rate is (comments + shares / post X 100). For example, say I had 33 comments + 12 shares / 1 post X 100. Then my engagement rate is equal to .45 or 45%. That\u2019s pretty damn good!\n\nSo Travis, what are some ways I can increase my engagement rate?\n\nI\u2019m glad you asked. Here are a couple of my favorites.\n\n1) Encourage visitors to subscribe to your content. First-time users are less likely to post than recurring ones. If you can incentive them to subscribe with a free video, report or special thank you note, they will feel more personally invested. Speaking of being personal\u2026\n\n2) Tell your story with emotion. Make your viewer feel something. Inspire them. Make them cry. Whatever you do, be vulnerable and connect with relatable material. As old-time philosophy Plato once said:\n\n3) Respond to the comments you do get. A no-brainer, but so many creators ignore what audience they do have. When you are small, it is incredibly important to reply to every message even if it\u2019s a \u201cthank you so-and-so.\u201d Put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes. How would you feel if your voice wasn\u2019t being heard. Human\u2019s crave attention and that goes both ways.\n\n4) Ask a question that needs an answer. This is one of my favorite techniques to use because it gives the viewer an excuse to respond. \u201cDo you prefer pancakes or french toast? Let me know in the comments section below.\u201d\n\n5) Post the first comment. It\u2019s a signal for social proof that takes pressure off others. Psychologically they are worrying too much about standing out from the crowd. When you post first, you are giving people permission to \u201cfit in.\u201d\n\nAs I think about where I can apply the PSR method, my 5 content ideas come to mind. I\u2019ve debated on using my past work history in the USAF and various service industry jobs, but those scenarios aren\u2019t built on content. Do you think I\u2019m doing a disservice to myself by ignoring my past job history?\n\nIf you like video games as much as I do, join me on twitch.tv\n\nIf you are an aspiring video game journalist, subscribe to my YouTube\n\nIf you want your story shared with others, DM me on Twitter"

        "title": "The Language of (Productive +) Constructive Feedback",
        "text": "Copywriters and graphic designers learn how to give and receive feedback on creative work organically. It\u2019s such a large part of their jobs that interacting with colleagues in this manner becomes second nature.\n\nBut not every role allots as many opportunities for giving constructive feedback on creative work. That said, I thought it would be helpful to share a few tricks for queueing up feedback so your thoughts are delivered in a way that is both constructive and encouraging to the creator.\n\nHead over heels for the imagery your designer colleague created for an upcoming marketing campaign? State why you believe the design is delivering upon the campaign\u2019s goals, not just that you adore their work. Justifying your reaction with an objective statement tied to the end goal sets the stage for greater learnings.\n\nTry: \u201cI love it! The color scheme you chose complements our summer collection perfectly, and I can see how the location of the CTA button will inspire our customers to click through to the shop page.\u201d\n\nSo much of our experiences as consumers is driven by emotion. We are drawn to a particular brand of body wash because the packaging reminds us of a recent Maui vacation or a painting just because.\n\nBut when it comes to giving feedback to creative colleagues \u2014 whose goals are to market a product \u2014 it\u2019s best to give objective versus subjective feedback.\n\nIf you have strong personal feelings about a piece of work that may be skewing your ability to provide objective feedback, consider why you may be feeling a certain way and explain it as such.\n\nInstead of: \u201cThe purple banner ad is definitely the winner.\u201d\n\nTry: \u201cSomething is drawing me to the purple banner ad over the green version. Perhaps my preference has to do with the strong contrast between the purple background and yellow text of that ad.\u201d\n\nYou can even take it a step further and ask the following: \u201cDo we have any A/B testing data showing how our customers have responded to these color choices in the past?\u201d\n\nBeing direct is crucial when giving feedback on creative work, but there is a fine line between being direct and curt. There are ways to communicate your feedback emphatically, respectfully, and constructively all at once \u2014 with the shared end goal of building the best product possible in mind.\n\nTone is, however, easier to detect in verbal communication than text. Text can invariably carry its own loaded undercurrents. A study by The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology found that wink faces used in e-communications are perceived as sarcastic 85 percent of the time. So note how your emojis, ellipses, and other punctuation can give your words unintended meaning.\n\nInstead of: \u201cI don\u2019t get why this is here\u2026\u201d\n\nTry: \u201cI\u2019m having a tough time understanding how this sentence supports the thesis in the intro of this blog post. Perhaps we could either lose it or layer in some more connective tissue to help the reader navigate the idea.\u201d\n\nProviding constructive feedback on what to change and why is great, but the real fun of collaboration is when multiple minds layer in new knowledge to strengthen a project or idea. This is the beauty of the \u201cvalue add.\u201d So, instead of just providing commentary on what to adjust, jump right in and offer up a new suggestion.\n\nInstead of: \u201cThe subject line for this email campaign doesn\u2019t quite catch my attention.\u201d\n\nTry: \u201cThis email campaign looks fantastic but I\u2019m wondering how we can strengthen the subject line so it\u2019s just as strong. Might we consider using a pun about music in the subject line to give our subscribers an engaging preview of the campaign theme?\u201d\n\nMost creative types are happy to consider tangible suggestions and build upon those suggestions to make them even stronger.\n\nBalancing critique with the right level of positive reinforcement and objective, goal-driven opinion is all about finding a balance and takes practice.

        "text": "Blockchain is a specific form or subset of distributed ledger technologies, which constructs a chronological chain of blocks, hence the name \u2018block-chain\u2019.\n\nA block refers to a set of transactions that are bundled together and added to the chain at the same time. In the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner nodes bundle unconfirmed and valid transactions into a block. Each block contains a given number of transactions. In the Bitcoin network, miners must solve a cryptographic challenge to propose the next block. This process is known as \u2018proof of work\u2019, and requires significant computing power.\n\nTransactions The record of an event, cryptographically secured with a digital signature, that is verified, ordered, and bundled together into blocks, form the transactions in the blockchain.\n\nCryptography has a key role to play both in the security, as well as in the immutability of the transactions recorded on blockchains. Cryptography is the study of the techniques used to allow secure communication between different parties and to ensure the authenticity and immutability of the data being communicated. For blockchain technologies, cryptography is used to prove that a transaction was created by the right person. It is also used to link transactions into a block in a tamper-proof way, as well as create the links between blocks, to form a blockchain.\n\nTimestamping is another key feature of blockchain technology. Each block is timestamped, with each new block referring to the previous block. Combined with cryptographic hashes, this timestamped chain of blocks provides an immutable record of all transactions in the network, from the very first (or genesis) block.\n\nA block commonly consists of four pieces of metadata:\n\nThe Merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure that is used to store hashes of the individual data in large datasets in a way to make the verification of the dataset efficient. It is an anti-tamper mechanism to ensure that the large dataset has not been changed.\n\nImportance of a single source of truth and it being shared with everyone from two people I admire the most.\n\nConsensus is a process whereby the computers that are part of the network synchronize the data on the blockchain. Consensus in the network refers to the process of achieving agreement among the network participants as to the correct state of data on the system. Consensus leads to all nodes sharing the exact same data. A consensus algorithm, hence, does two things: it ensures that the data on the ledger is the same for all the nodes in the network, and, in turn, prevents malicious actors from manipulating the data. The consensus algorithm varies with different blockchain implementations.\n\nThere are a number of consensus mechanisms or algorithms.\n\nBitcoin uses Proof of Work, while Ethereum uses Proof of Work currently, but is moving towards Proof of Stake. The Hyperledger Sawtooth uses Proof of Elapsed Time. Zilica uses PBFT."

        "text": "Last Fall I was interested in getting involved in the startup scene. As fascinated, and ambitious 21-year old student, I had heard about my fair share of startup success stories. Thus set in FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\nFuck it I said, I\u2019m going to try my own. If it fails, I have nothing to lose (says the overly optimistic broke college student).\n\nPreviously, when I was 17, I had started a small service business. The reason behind that venture was simple. I could earn more money running my gig than working for someone else during the Summers. The result? I didn\u2019t make more money. I did, however, acquire more skills than my peers (at least I think), and most significant of all, the desire to be an entrepreneur was born.\n\nEvery year, the Government of Ontario (a Canadian Province for the geographically impaired) offers a 3,000 dollar grant and mentorship to a select number of successful student-run startup companies. I applied, and to my surprise, I received the funding and mentorship.\n\nWhy am I saying this?\n\nWell, the funding and more significantly, the mentorship I received helped me run a successful business when I had no fucking clue what I was doing. Therefore, when I decided to embark on this journey (to create a more innovative startup), I was more aware of the many opportunities to help get me started.\n\nFast forward to this past Fall when I was in Costa Rica. It was there that I became inspired by a local business creating shirts made with banana leaf fibre. I asked the shop owner more about the supply-chain, and that\u2019s when I became inspired by Cradle to Cradle design.\n\nWith that knowledge, I brainstormed innovative ways I could create my own, unique circular business model. Finally, I decided on this.\n\nThen, this is how simple it is to quote \u2018try,\u2019 I applied to an incubator program offered by my University. A few weeks later I was invited to pitch my concept. \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve never made a pitch before\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a Skillshare class on making a pitch\u201d I did.\n\nI pitched my idea to a panel of judges, and one week later I got a congratulatory email. I would receive an 8,000 dollar grant and professional mentorship and workshops for one year.\n\nFast-forward 16 weeks, our company has graduated from the incubator program, we\u2019ve grown from just me to three founders, as well as earned the support of numerous skilled professionals who are offering their help.\n\nI believe my startup will be successful, but if it\u2019s not (which is okay), I\u2019ve learned more by just trying and taking that first step to creating something meaningful.\n\nI\u2019ve learned more then I would have if instead I took five full-time classes last semester and slaved away on autopilot. I\u2019ve learned how to build and motivate a team. I\u2019ve learned how to differentiate my good ideas from lousy ones. Overall, I\u2019m more confident in everything I do.\n\nNot to mention, my experience has opened the doors to numerous other opportunities. I\u2019ve been offered multiple internship positions at successful startups, one of which I\u2019ve taken and will be able to do on the side.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re reading this and you want to learn, get involved, \u2018get your foot in the door\u2019 if you will? Then all I can say is seek out these opportunities, and take that first step and try. Even if you don\u2019t succeed, the amount of personal and professional growth you\u2019ll experience is worth every second."

        "text": "So, I\u2019m approaching my 2-month anniversary here on Medium, and it\u2019s safe to say this has been one of the most life-changing experiences of my life.\n\nHaving gone from factory machine employee at the bottom of the tank to a self-employed freelance content writer, Medium unlocked the artistic and creative side of writing for me, and it\u2019s been the first point in my life where I\u2019ve truly found purpose and passion for the things I\u2019m doing in my day to day life.\n\nAs you may have heard me harp on about in my other articles, I adore how Medium has become a platform for people to have real, open and honest conversations with the rest of the world without having to deal with a 280-character limit.\n\nI mean come on, how is it actually possible to share a unique personal perspective with another human being in a Tweet?\n\nAs the last 30-days have gone by, like most writers on here, I\u2019ve taken a look at my stats to see what\u2019s performing the best and what I can improve on.\n\nTo date, I\u2019m currently sitting around the 4,500 views per 30 days mark and have amassed around 280 followers. I\u2019ve met some incredible people and some fantastic writers as well as engaged in some wonderful conversations with them that have only concreted my belief that this is the platform of the future.\n\nI\u2019m looking at you Victoria Goulding, Jakub Ferencik and Francine Reinhardt Romano, you guys are awesome. If you haven\u2019t read their masterpieces before, I suggest putting this at the top of your to-do list.\n\nThank you to each and every one of you who has taken the time to read my work and I hope to some degree it\u2019s managed to inspire, motivate or in some way positively help you on your own journey.\n\nYour feedback has been incredible.\n\nWe all regularly see posts on Medium that detail how to reach 10K views in your first six months, or how to get 5,000 readers in three months. Many of these posts include tips like;\n\n\u00b7 Follow the maximum amount of people a day to see if they follow you back\n\n\u00b7 Become a top writer in your chosen field\n\n\u00b7 Customise the post to stand out from the crowd (like using bullet points \ud83d\ude09)\n\nI\u2019m sure you get the idea. The list goes on and on.\n\nHowever, while my primary goal when I joined Medium was to get as many followers as possible, so I could get my message out to the masses, this quickly changed in the first month.\n\nEven more so over the second.\n\nWhile I understand the fact that some people are using Medium to build up their brands, drive traffic to their websites and promote themselves, it\u2019s easy to see not all of us are writing for the same reason.\n\nFor the vast majority, we\u2019re writing because it\u2019s something that we love. It\u2019s the art and craft that we\u2019re most passionate about.\n\nThis is something I\u2019m relatively new to myself, but reading the posts of the people I follow, you can feel just how raw some of these messages are, how emotional the feelings are and how deep the story behind the words and sentences goes.\n\nSome of the posts on here can easily bring you to tears when you envision yourself in a similar situation. Each tale has a message that the writer is trying to share and provides honest wisdom we can learn from.\n\nYet, when our primary goal or target is to maximise the number of followers we have, we end up trying to write content to suit what we believe our audience wants to read, not what comes from the heart which is the reason they started following you in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m guilty of it. I\u2019m sure we all are to a certain extent.\n\nPicture it this way.\n\nThink about the last article you published or the piece you\u2019re currently working on. Imagine standing up in a venue and reading it aloud to nearly 300 people. For some of you, you may have over a thousand, maybe even several thousand, followers. Imagine reading your content aloud to all those people, sharing your message through spoken word.\n\nYou might say a sentence and notice people highlighting what you\u2019ve said, quoting you on their notepads. At the end of your piece, members of the audience come up to you and respond to what you\u2019ve said.\n\nMy highest performance piece to date \u2014 You Have 30,000 Opportunities to Live Your Life \u2014 currently sits at 939 views.\n\nIf I envision myself standing on a stage and reading that piece to an audience of 939 people, what an absolutely incredible and amazing experience that would be.\n\nAs I expected, my lowest performing pieces are from the week where I attempted to write self-help and improvement pieces, simply because that\u2019s what I saw on Medium and decided to replicate.\n\nI\u2019m not saying these pieces give poor advice. Hell, the pieces I wrote are on topics I\u2019m passionate about and have real-life experiences with, but this is all surface level stuff.\n\nAll in all, it doesn\u2019t matter if I have 10 followers or 1,000,000 followers.\n\nOf course, being able to share my message with the masses and engage in a one-sided (perhaps two-sided) conversation with people all over the world is an amazing concept, especially when my passion is to use writing to help people and make the world a more positive place.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re reading this now, and you feel inspired to write about something that truly matters to you, perhaps your experiences with mental health, a situation where you felt more lost, angry or confused than any time in your entire life, the happiest you\u2019ve ever been, the moment you fell in or out of love, or you hold a message or the knowledge that you want to share with the world, imagine how many lives you could change.\n\nWe can all set our alarms for half five in the morning, drink vitamin smoothies and hide our phones in our drawer while trying to boost our productivity. This way of life can do wonders regarding the amount of work you\u2019re producing and how well you perform in your career.\n\nBut having the ability to structure words and form sentences that could pull someone back from the very edge of rock bottom or give them the boost they need to follow their heart and live out their dreams is a unique ability that only writers possess.\n\nOf course, every follow, clap, response and share mean the world to me. Every bit of feedback, no matter how small, is just proof to me that I\u2019m doing what I love and that I\u2019m communicating my message in the right way.\n\nStories can take us to amazing places, whether that\u2019s in our heads, our hearts or out somewhere in the universe. Stories have been told among humans since we were drawing on cave walls and engraving symbols into the walls of pyramids.\n\nWe\u2019re now in the era where we have the potential to connect with thousands, millions, perhaps even billions of people, with the click of a button.\n\nAll of us have this unique opportunity to get out there, get our fingers tapping and to share something amazing with the world. We\u2019re given this opportunity every single day of our lives.\n\nThis is a opportunity no other human being that has ever lived in the history of humanity has had before.\n\nHow are you going to use yours?"

        "text": "We have all had bosses we hated at work.\n\nThey are an easy figure to hate, as they are the ones giving out the orders. Sometimes this is justified, most of the time it\u2019s not.\n\nHowever, if you have had a bad boss, there are a number of characteristsics that stick out. The first one that sticks out is blaming others, our boss when we were laying pipe was keen on this.\n\nWhenever something went wrong, there was always someone who was responsible. Yet, it was never him. There had to be a scapegoat. He couldn\u2019t accept that sometimes things just go wrong.\n\nThis blame culture didn\u2019t exactly endear him to us. It got to the point where we were dreading something going wrong, as it would be a case of who\u2019s going to get it now.\n\nHe fostered a toxic environment where people didn\u2019t want to work for him. In fact, we couldn\u2019t wait to get away from him. If we could be down the other end of the site doing something, we would be.\n\nLeading is not an easy job, it doesn\u2019t come easy to most of us. We are happier being led, than being the one doing the leading.\n\nYet, it\u2019s not as hard as we might think. You have to put yourselves in the shoes of your workers.\n\nPeople respond to motivation and encouragement. The best managers realise this and treat their workers as people, instead of pieces on a chess board they can manoeuvre around.\n\nTreat your workers like people, and they have will work their sock off for you.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s true about construction, it\u2019s that you\u2019re going to be working hard.\n\nYou have to. There is no way around it. To build houses, roads and lay pipes you have to break your back.\n\nThis isn\u2019t easy. There were times when I wanted nothing more than to stop and take a break. But, we had to carry on and do as much as we could today to make tomorrow easier.\n\nIf any of us started slacking, all of us would be affected. We would fall further behind, and we end up doing the job for longer than any of us wanted.\n\nIt may have been tough, but by working hard, we were ensuring we made progress on a daily basis.\n\nHard work is hard, but it\u2019s also rewarding. If you want to accomplish anything, from building a house to building a business, you have to work hard.\n\nThere is no way around it.\n\nYour dreams and ambitions are not simply going to happen, you have push yourself to make them happen.\n\nTalent alone will take you part of the way, but hard work will take you all of the way."

        "text": "By the end of the day, the team was humming along so smoothly that Stanley only needed to apply a small amount of positive feedback every now and then, like adding a brief push to an already free-spinning wheel. This freed Stanley to pay attention to other things. He strolled to the top of the hill to survey the collection of cars that his company had pushed to its apex. Once there, he was surprised to find employees of another company lowering those same cars down the other side of the hill. He realized that the customer was actually trying to get the cars from one side of the hill to the other, and not just to its top. As he surveyed the terrain from that clear vantage point, he had an small epiphany. After looking around to make sure that nobody had heard his epiphany, and hoping that the wind would carry the smell away, he marched back down the hill to make some notes.\n\nAfter hatching his plan, Stanley intercepted Emma and Bill halfway up the hill and persuaded them to lower the car back to the base of the hill. Even though undoing good work didn\u2019t seem to make sense to them at the time, Bill and Emma had come to trust Stanley, and they knew that he respected them and their efforts. They believed that if Stanley wanted them to bring the car back down then it must be for a very good reason.\n\nOnce they were at the bottom of the hill, Stanley showed Bill and Emma his notes, and Bill suggested using something called a \u201csteering wheel\u201d to direct the car in an arc. Emma was assigned to sit in the car and steer it, while Bill and Stanley pushed. At first the steering didn\u2019t work, but Emma was able to figure out that it was locked, and they it could be unlocked by turning something called a \u201ckey\u201d one notch clockwise while turning the steering wheel a little bit at the same time. Emma had found the key under the sun visor, which they determined to be the incubator of car keys. \u201cThe sun visor it like a marsupial\u2019s pouch,\u201d Bill explained during a keynote speech at the International Conference on Car Pushing (ICCP) later that year.\n\nWith aplomb, CarPusher delivered the final three cars to join the others at the far side of the hill. Emma, Bill, and Stanley pushed the final car to its destination before the other company had completely lowered all of the other cars down the hill. CarPusher had gone above and beyond the expectations of its customer, understanding and fulfilling the customer\u2019s broader requirements, and using an innovative approach to do it using less effort.\n\nCarPusher went on to file a patent application for a Method for Maneuvering a Plurality of Vehicles Around a Geographical Prominence. The new technology was branded and marketed as AroundHill\u2122. Stanley made sure that adverts were running on every FM radio station in the country:\n\nMan with deep, charismatic voice: \u201cDo you have a car?\u201d\n\nMan: \u201cDo you need to move it around a hill?\u201d\n\nM: \u201cDo you value high quality and great customer service?\u201d\n\nM: \u201cYou need AroundHill\u2122 technology from CarPusher, where hands meet hoods.\u201d\n\nThen the iconic chimes of the CarPusherBehind\u00ae campaign played in order to accentuate this moment of deep realization."

        "text": "So how do you stay safe, especially if you have to continue working with a bridge burner until the embers die down?\n\nFirst, stay calm. Try your best not to react to the bad behavior, especially when you\u2019re emotional. You may not be able to control the other person\u2019s behavior, but you can control your own.\n\nKeep your distance. Don\u2019t ignore the person when you know you shouldn\u2019t, but keep any necessary interactions with the person as short and limited as possible.\n\nWhen having discussions with the other person, always state facts and facts only. Avoid expressing your emotions to someone who can\u2019t be trusted with your emotions.\n\nRemain professional in your limited interactions even when the other person doesn\u2019t.\n\nEstablish boundaries. If the person keeps trying to cross those boundaries, keep repeating your boundaries over and over. If the behavior continues despite your repeated requests for it to stop, report it."

        "text": "Please understand obtaining mastery in any subject or skill is an extremely long and tedious journey. There is absolutely no short cut to becoming a master at anything. If you are looking for that, this is not the place. Instead I am going to provide a blueprint anyone is capable of following, explaining how to become a master.\n\nTwo roads diverged in a wood and I \u2014 I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\n\n-Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken\n\nA quote we have all heard before, with an underlying theme we are all too familiar with. Understand this road to mastery, true mastery, is often lonesome. It does not have to be, however it usually is. This is because the persistence and dedication required to achieve mastery is extremely tiresome and trying. It leaves little room for much else.\n\nKeep this in the back of your mind throughout the journey.\n\nObtaining mastery is not something for everyone. It takes special individuals with special ambitions. This is not to say you can\u2019t be good at something through simple hard work, quite the opposite. Anyone, through work, prudence, and persistence can experience success. That is not what this article is about. The article relates to mastery.\n\nHard work is not enough to become a master. Persistence is not enough to become a master. Self-discipline is not enough to become a master. Natural intelligence is not enough to become a true master. To attain mastery, an individual needs all the above traits, and countless others. Furthermore, you must be willing to sacrifice everything for your vision.\n\nThis simple, yet necessary, component to mastery is so frequently overlooked it makes me sick. Whether this omittance is explained by outright ignorance, apathy, or something else I don\u2019t know.\n\nAs the clich\u00e9 goes, you must learn to walk before you can crawl.\n\nAlthough trivial, the previous quote contains nearly unparalleled wisdom. To become an expert at anything, you must become an expert at the fundamentals. After truly grasping this fundamental knowledge, individuals can begin expanding upon the subject or skill. Moving into more difficult material, and all the while continuing to build upon that foundation of fundamental knowledge.\n\nOne can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci understood what it meant to be a master. The Italian Renaissance man is hailed as one of the greatest painters and architectural masterminds of all time. And after reading this quote it is obvious why. Da Vinci understood mastery takes more than raw talent, you must also learn to master your emotions and way of thinking.\n\nExpecting mastery is a hopeless endeavor without first mastering thyself. You must learn to control and manage thoughts in a way others are unwilling to.\n\nThis is not as simple as it seems. If it were simpler, we would have more masters. The truth is we, as individuals and as a society, often perform acts we look back at with regret. Whether it be not working for that extra hour, or having an extra piece of dessert for dinner. Mastery of the mind rids us of these burdens.\n\nThis road to mastery is long and wide. You must learn to bask in the journey. Without this appreciation for the process, reaching the top of the mountain is nearly impossible.\n\nFurthermore, understand you will fall. This is inevitable. Get back up and continue to develop your skill. Continue to improve each and every day.\n\nAs the great Chinese philosopher said.\n\nIt does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop.\n\nThen, if it\u2019s all said and done and you never reach the mountain, that is alright. You know you gave every ounce of strength and every fiber of thought to the vision. This is something we can all look at with pride and acceptance.\n\nIf you enjoyed, please leave a like a clap! Thanks for taking the time to read, I appreciate it!"

        "text": "Don\u2019t let your day-to-day job discourage you, keep building towards your dream\n\nIf you\u2019re currently working for a big company, I\u2019m sure you know how it can feel to get bogged down and demoralized.\n\nIt is very easy to get frustrated with internal politics and people who are shifting work or blame away from themselves onto you. And then these things make you miserable on a day-to-day basis which makes it that much more difficult to do the work on the side that it takes for you to achieve your dreams.\n\nBut if you think strategically about how you go about your day-to-day work, you can free up the space you need in order to work towards achieving your goals.\n\nTo begin with, you need to have an idea of where you want to go next. This could be your dream job or the business you want to start, or an in-between step that will get you a little bit closer to your end goal.\n\nThen based on whatever that next step is, identify the skills that you will need to be successful. If it is a new job you want, identify the skills required by looking at job descriptions for similar roles. For starting a business, do some research and read stories of successful entrepreneurs in your area of interest to get a feel for their backgrounds and skill-sets.\n\nOnce you know the skills that you need to have to take your next step, you can do an honest assessment of where you need to grow the most. Then you should spend as much time as possible building these skills in your current job.\n\nAs a starting point, you should completely max out any training courses that are available through your company. Many companies offer massive libraries of online courses, workshops and classroom trainings, and support for external certification programs.\n\nYou should take full advantage of all of the above.\n\nBut how do you make sure you have the time to take advantage of all of these opportunities?\n\nI cannot emphasize this point enough. Saying \u201cno\u201d is probably one of the most important things you can do in a big company, but it is also one of the toughest things to do.\n\nIt is so easy to come into a new job at a big company and get dragged into a whole range of different things because you want to make a good impression. Some of these will help you meet your goals but many more will be an absolute black hole and eat all of your time.\n\nThis is why understanding your next step is so important: you have to recognize the activities that will not help you towards this next step and spend the least amount of time on these possible.\n\nNow, some of these tasks may be part of your core role that you are formally responsible for. In this case, you should try to get an understanding of exactly what is required and how you can get these tasks done in the most productive way possible.\n\nMaybe you can write a few macros to automate some manual work away or maybe there is someone else who would like to take a task on as a development opportunity for them. Other people will have different goals from yours, and one person\u2019s headache might be someone else\u2019s dream job \u2014 get to know people in the office and try to help each other.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should be impolite. You should be very strategic in how you say \u201cno\u201d so that you are still seen as a good team player and are able to get involved in the tasks that are good for your development.\n\nIn order to do this effectively, you need to develop a good understanding of your current role and how it fits into the wider organization.\n\nMake an effort to tune into town halls and communications from senior managers. Understand what the strategic priorities of the organization are. Read the annual report and investor presentations. Observe and pay close attention to the culture and the way that things actually get done.\n\nBy doing this, you can know make the connection of how your job is helping the company meet its objectives. And if you can articulate why this doesn\u2019t make sense for you to take a task on in the words of the company\u2019s strategy, you have a much more persuasive case.\n\nBut in order for your \u201cno\u201d to be credible, you have to do something else.\n\nAny time that a project comes up that will help you towards your next step, you should jump at the opportunity immediately.\n\nIf you know, for example, that you need to improve your marketing skills to start your business and your company is looking for volunteers to contribute to articles, you should be one of the first volunteers.\n\nNot only does this give you direct experience and learning in the skills that you are trying to build, it will also gives you the right to say \u201cno\u201d to the things that you shouldn\u2019t be spending your time on.\n\nBy raising your hand to take on the things that will help you, you are showing yourself as a team player and someone who is not afraid to take on more. So when something comes up and you say \u201cno, I already have enough going on\u201d, it is something that no one can really argue with.\n\nIf you are able to keep this up, over time you will find that you are spending more time on tasks that are directly building the skills you need and you will still have enough time to take advantage of the learning opportunities at your disposal.\n\nKeep focused on your vision and you will feel better about where you are in your job because you are building towards your dream. Then before you know it, you will be ready to take that next step."

        "title": "There\u2019s Can Always Be More than One Outcome \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "One of my favorite stories of all time is about an eagle who believed himself to be a chicken. The story goes something like this:\n\nThe lesson behind this story is often interpreted as not being able to see our own potential, that we\u2019re all \u201ceagles\u201d in our own right with the ability to soar high and achieve success. It\u2019s not a bad interpretation, but I believe there\u2019s a better lesson to be learned.\n\nIt\u2019s to never live your life based on the words and expectations of others.\n\nThere are always people in life that will tell you that something can\u2019t be done, that you shouldn\u2019t even try because it\u2019s just not possible. When people say something can\u2019t be done, it\u2019s because it\u2019s something they can\u2019t do themselves. It\u2019s reference to their own ability and their own experiences. A favorite quote of mine sums this up accurately:\n\nPeople like telling others that they\u2019re not capable of something because it nurtures their ego. Those people like comparing themselves against you because they want you to be at their level or lower. So they flaunt their experiences, and mockingly imprint what\u2019s originally their own limitation onto you instead, as if they already know you\u2019ll never be able to achieve what they couldn\u2019t themselves.\n\nAnd it\u2019s sad to say, but many of us believe in the exact limitations of what we\u2019re told. Without trying, we\u2019ve already considered ourselves incapable based on other people\u2019s experiences. We take their words for granted, give up on our dreams, give up on all that we believe in simply because someone came along and said we couldn\u2019t. We are the eagles in the story but we believe ourselves to be chickens all because someone came along and said we couldn\u2019t.\n\nWhat most of us don\u2019t realize is that limits are meant to be broken. We\u2019re supposed to exceed our limits because that\u2019s how we grow. That\u2019s how we discover our potential, live up to it and achieve the goals, desires, and dreams we\u2019ve set for ourselves. That\u2019s how we live the lives we want and be able to look back when we\u2019re old and say: That\u2019s a life well-lived.\n\nIf we live our whole lives listening to the expectations that other people have set for us, we\u2019ll never find out what we\u2019re truly capable of. We\u2019ll never know what\u2019s it like to have broken our limits and achieve the very thing that others believed was not possible for us in the first place.\n\nThere\u2019s can always be a different outcome, an alternative to the ending you choose. Just because we\u2019re being told what to do doesn\u2019t mean we have to listen. Too many of us live our lives scared, too afraid to take up the challenge and break out of the norm; we limit ourselves because we fear the rules set by society.\n\nBut rules are not the same thing as laws. We don\u2019t always have to abide by rules. They\u2019re just guidelines, created by other people mainly for the sake of their own convenience. We can challenge those rules, challenge those guidelines, challenge the expectations that others have of us. We can break the rules.\n\nThe greatest attestation I have to this is a story of my own:\n\nWhat my friend did gave me perspective and the very realization that all decisions in life can have more than one outcome. My friend wasn\u2019t a celebrity or anyone special, he just said he was. He challenged the rule, he challenged the very notion of being held back by the limitations set by other people. Where others said he couldn\u2019t or assumed he couldn\u2019t, he did and proved them wrong, because, what\u2019s the worst that could\u2019ve happened?\n\nThere will always be moments in your life when you wonder Am I capable of this? or Will I be able to succeed? and the answer is almost always \u2018yes\u2019. The moment you began considering whether or not it\u2019s possible, you\u2019ve already given yourself hope. If you truly didn\u2019t believe it be possible, you wouldn\u2019t have even asked that question. The one thing that can stop us from fulfilling that question is our own self-doubt.\n\nThe important thing is to not take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. It is not to limit yourself based on the words and expectations of others. Find your limits and break them."

The inconsistency reveals you\u2019re actually NOT detail-oriented.\n\nOther inconsistencies such as not having all your headings in the same font size and format give them a reason to throw out your resume.\n\nAnd of course, so do misspellings and grammatical errors.\n\nWhy do recruiters do this?\n\nWith the volume of resumes received for each job, recruiters have to narrow down their options to something more manageable given all their additional job responsibilities.\n\nDo everything you can to ensure your resume is the best it can be.

        "text": "How To Make The Right Business Decision (By Answering 2 Simple Questions)\n\n\u201c\u0093Shall I show you the sinews of a philosopher? \u0091What sinews are those?\u0092 A will un-disappointed; evils avoided; powers daily exercised; careful resolutions; unerring decisions.\u0094\u201d \u2014 Juvenal, from Epictetus\n\nSome of the decisions you face are major. (\u0093Should I quit this job and go into business for myself?\u0094) But most of them are minor.\n\nI was reminded of this by two recent experiences. A nutritional-supplement business I consult with was foundering (if not floundering) because of mediocre marketing and a large overhead.\n\nIt had gotten so bad that, in desperation, we considered selling the business to a competitor. This led, indirectly, to two decisions \u0096 neither of which seemed monumental at the time.\n\nOne was to trim the staff to its bare bones. The other was to try a marketing piece we had on the back burner.\n\nThe result? Before we could finish our negotiations, the business had turned around completely. Three months later, it paid off all its debt and was taking in a very healthy monthly profit.\n\nAnother company I am close to, was chugging along nicely but had no apparent prospects of breaking into a higher level of profitability. Against my better judgment, they tested a continuity offer. (Until then, the business was strictly cash-with-order.) The result? The business doubled in less than a year.\n\nAnother company was about to go out of business when its competitor, Time-Life, shared information about its secret marketing weapon: a call center that was upgrading a high percentage of orders. Their publishers made the decision to move into telemarketing immediately \u0096 and today the company enjoys revenues of more than $300 million, 25% of which is generated from telemarketing.\n\nSmall decisions \u2014 they add up to success or failure.\n\nIn the midst of the flurry that is normal business, how do you make sure that most of your decisions are moving you closer to \u2014 rather than farther away from \u2014 your objectives?\n\nIt ain\u2019\u0092t easy. The pressure is on. You have no time to waste. Everybody is shouting. What do you choose? Door \u21161 or door \u21162?\n\nDecide quickly! But decide right! Your future is at stake!\n\nYou are a child frantically searching for Easter eggs. Dozens of other kids are competing with you. Which way do you go? Turn right or left?\n\nLook under the bushes or behind the tree? You want to hear a familiar voice, Mom\u0092s or Dad\u0092s, shouting, \u0093warmer . . . warmer . . . no, colder . . . colder still . . . yes, warmer, warmer . . . .\u0094\n\nJSN, a mentor and former partner, had an uncanny instinct for making the right decisions. I always marveled at it. Two equally impressive job candidates? He could spot the fraud. Price the magazine at $25 or $50? His guess was almost always right. Headlines? He was the master at choosing the right rhetorical hook.\n\nHow did he do it? That\u0092s what I wanted to know. For years.\n\nFinally, though, I think I\u2018ve figured it out. As smart a guy as JSN was, his mind was relatively simple when it came to business decisions. For him, business was about profit. And profit was good.\n\nFor me the purpose of business was a more complicated thing.\n\nProfit was, undeniably, one goal, but there were many others. Any decision I faced had to be studied through a prism of considerations \u0096 how would this affect product quality? What would customers say? What would my competitors think?\n\nFor JSN any particular decision was \u2014 a choice between one clear thing and another. For me \u2014 it was a road that split into a dozen directions, one toward danger, another toward greed, still another toward conflict and another toward the very fires of hell.\n\nJSN was very good at making money. He still is.\n\nI have benefited from observing him. Nowadays, when I am asked to choose, I always ask myself, \u0093which choice will make the most money?\u0094\n\nSuch an easy question. So seldom asked simply.\n\nI am involved in many businesses. I have many partners. Some of them are very smart. Some of them are talented. But those who are best at business tend to be able to think simply when it comes to key decisions.\n\nThose who get slowed down by \u0093\u201dwhat ifs\u201d\u0094 and \u201c\u0093if onlys\u0094\u201d tend to see their businesses stall. If they can\u2019\u0092t come to a decision, how can they expect their subordinates to?\n\nHaving what is conventionally thought of as a complex mind is not an advantage in business. In fact, I wonder if it is an advantage at all\u2026\n\nSomeone once told me that people who think a lot are unhappy people. I read somewhere else that psychological studies say the happiest people are those who have the least subtle minds.\n\nIf those observations are true, we might want to add this one:\n\nIf you suffer from a complex mind, don\u0092t despair. You probably can\u2019\u0092t simplify your thinking entirely (except by doing something that is likely to hurt a lot), but you can make your business decisions simpler.\n\nFirst I remember that my business has only two goals \u0096 to provide good advice and to profit from it. All other considerations \u2014 and there are many of them \u2014 are secondary. When I\u0092m bogged down, I search them out in my thinking. Search and destroy.\n\nForget about every other consideration:\n\nYes or No? Answer it!\n\nThat\u0092s how I do it. Hope it works for you."

        "text": "How to pick the right influencer Finding an influencer for an Instagram influencer marketing campaign is NOT EASY. In fact, if there\u2019s one thing to keep in mind, it\u2019s this: Not every influencer is going to be right for your brand.\n\nWhich means; this is where YOU and YOUR BRAND need to be.\n\nIf the above stats are comforting enough we hope THIS can change your mind.\n\nWe all know one. A Youtube superstar. An Instagram model. A fashionable blogger. Influencers come in all shapes and sizes and with the digital possibilities increasing; this branch of native advertising is getting more and more popular among brands.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to just choose the influencer who has the largest amount of followers, and generates the highest number of likes, comments, and shares to do influencer marketing for your brand. But unless their goals & brand image are aligned with yours, this won\u2019t be a match made in influencer marketing heaven.\n\nThere are some key elements you may want to consider, in order to identify the right influencer for your brand while keeping in mind ROI.\n\nDraw the line between Branding and Sales.\n\nOne of the primary mistakes that happen when choosing an influencer is looking at reach as a sole indicator for success and potential sales. Yes, reach is necessary if you need help to seed your spill but influencers have much more to give to a brand than short term financial returns. They are excellent content creators, they made their success from being creative and they know exactly what engages the target audience.\n\nRemember, to gain awareness you can always amplify content with paid media.\n\nWhen you think influencer marketing, think larger than the traditional digital KPIs such as CPM, CPV, CPC etc. Most influencers will have a hard time keeping up with your digital benchmarks \u2014 showing the big boss the actual value of the campaign\u2019s ROI will be difficult if you do not include more qualitative measurements. Identify your campaign goals before you begin and include considerations that focus on the influencer marketing\u2019s strong sides \u2014 like engaging the audience, creative storytelling and time spent curating content with the brand.\n\nNow, if you are using Instagram as a core platform within your sales strategy or perhaps looking for a short cash grab on obsolete inventory before rebranding your business, then you are lucky enough to be living in the era of not only \u2018influencer marketing\u2019, but \u2018Shop Now TAGS\u2019.\n\nWhat are Instagram SHOP NOW tags?\n\nThe Shop Now Tag feature is an exceptional window into influencers sales conversion and undressing the leverage of social profiles within your e-commerce strategy.\n\nFind out how to enable product tags HERE.\n\nInfluencers are typically specialized in a specific topic or category.\n\nMapping out the relevant context for your brand is essential to improving relevance in the target audience. The standard categories such as fashion, mummy, food, fitness, travel etc. can be helpful, but defining other criteria for your influencers will help you create a strong match. Let\u2019s say you have a specific kitchen appliance, like a pizza oven that you want a blogger to review. It would most likely be a food blogger, but you also need to make sure that this blogger has a fairly big kitchen in order to have space for it on the kitchen. Or let\u2019s say you are a fashion company looking for an influencer to create content for your social platforms. In this case it would also be important that the influencer\u2019s visual look suit your brand guidelines. Setting up all the criteria in advance will help you find a strong match and automatically decrease time spent on finding the right influencers \u2014 you will know exactly what to look for.\n\nSo do we just send a product to the selected influencer and hope for the best? Of course NOT!\n\nThe most crucial part of influencer marketing is finding the story before heading for the $$$ return. Most brands have an idea of what they want the influencers to say but the key to creating trustworthy recommendations is telling the story in the bloggers own words and ways. There is a fine line between telling an influencer what to post and creating an inspiring branded story that leaves enough space for individual creativity. The second often gives the best results \u2014 especially if you are using more than one influencer. It is all about finding the sweet spot where brand, audience (influencer) and topicality meets.\n\nThis is were you dig deep.\n\nNow we are at the step where you actually find your influencers and often the most time consuming part of influencer marketing for those who do it right. It is not just about choosing the top three influencers in a category or influencers that are accidentally on your radar. You want to dig deeper and look at the influencer\u2019s platforms, content themes, past brand collaborations, tone-of-voice etc. If you are a beef jerky business and you wish to do a brand collaboration with an influencer, you do not want to choose an influencer who has shown tendencies of veganism. Another example could be a travelling agency providing ski trips to an influencer who has in the past mentioned that she hates snow and only travels within 100km of the equator. My point is, invest some time in looking at the individual influencers past content and stories \u2014 you might even find that they have already mentioned your brand by own interest.\n\nThe most important thing to have in mind when you work with influencers is that they are not digital platforms that you buy into with a branded message."

        "title": "Moonshot Week 13: Zclassic (ZCL) a Forking Dream \u2013 The Startup \u2013",
        "text": "Read the twelfth part of our Moonshot series, which focuses on Komodo, here.\n\nThe market has finally turned bullish, and there seem to be many underpriced altcoins that have yet to appreciate. Each week BTCManager and the JaketheCryptoKing are going to explore a new moonshot opportunity.\n\nWe are in week 13 of this moonshot experiment! With the markets beginning a bullish turn and projects on the horizon this is the perfect time to acquire a coin that\u2019s value is associated with its privacy tech and forking ability. The moonshot for the week beginning April 15, 2018, is; ZCL.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has risen more than 20 percent this week which many are attributing to an impending bull run. Even so, the price of bitcoin is still down over 50 percent since mid-December. With market sentiment having just shifted from negative back to positive with the jump in BTC pricing it seems the cryptocurrency markets are poised to make another run. As BTC increases in value market sentiment continues to build and when bitcoin stagnates the altcoins generally appreciate more rapidly. Crypto traders and continuously searching for the highest yielding coin but those that return thousands of percentages are sometimes in plain sight.\n\nZclassic (ZCL) is down over 97 percent since its all-time high set during the period leading up to its prior fork. Once the fork occurred ZCL started to immediately correct. Now that the market has corrected and began to turn bullish coins which are \u201cproject targets\u201d such as ZCL such be monitored as new big crypto endeavors are announced. Speculatively speaking, Twitter personalities have been hinting at another ZCL project for the last few weeks. If one does materialize expect a nice run in the price of ZCL.\n\nGiven that ZCL has fallen more than 97 percent since its all-time high this leaves plenty of room to trend North. However, most investors and traders do not realize why the price of ZCL collapsed. Understanding what makes a coin valued by the crypto market is very important when choosing an investment target or moonshot. Utility increases value, and ZCL is a coin that is utilized as a privacy coin and specifically targeted by teams for large-scale projects for its forking capabilities.\n\nThe most recent price collapse of ZCL was due to BTCP forking off of it. ZCL had a run from under $5 in December to over $220 by the day of their fork, February 28, 2018. Even with a delay and multiple missteps ZCL traded above $200 per coin and BTCP (the fork of ZCL) is currently trading at $52 per coin. This means a new fork of ZCL if conducted by a skilled team with no missteps and greater community adoption should trade more than $52 per coin.\n\nThe value increase that took place in December and January with ZCL coincided directly with the market trying to predict what the forked coin would eventually be worth. The price of BTCP is currently valued at over $50. With no new forks announced and no significant events on the horizon ZCL has fallen back to the $7 price point. Clearly when ZCL is a part of a project which involves a fork the value of ZCL increases dramatically. Many Twitter personalities in the last few weeks have been hinting at a team taking over another major ZCL project. If any projects get finalized in the next few weeks and if the forking team is lucky enough to catch a bull run ZCL could reach new all-time highs in the near future.\n\nHaving fallen more than 97 percent ZCL seems like a simple choice to select as part of one\u2019s portfolio given its ability to be sent anonymously while providing the significant upside associated with the strong likelihood of a team undertaking another fork of it. This is a privacy coin with unlimited upside that has already had an unfathomable correction. An active community and new project will easily bring this coin back to life; the question becomes who will undertake it?\n\nZCL uses the underlying privacy technology of zk-SNARK which stands for, \u201cZero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,\u201d and refers to a proof of construction where one can prove possession of certain information without revealing that information and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.\u201d This privacy technology allows ZCL users to remain anonymous went transacting with ZCL without revealing on the public ledger where the funds were coming from, where they were going, or what amount was being sent.\n\nZCL is currently priced at $6.88, with a market cap of 26 million. The numbers during the peak of the fork period were a market cap of over $600 million and a ZCL price of over $220. Forks greatly improve underlying technologies while adding features that many users desire. This ability to incorporate the best features of multiple coins onto one platform allows for forks to continue to remain valuable in the crypto space. This also continues to drive development of new technologies to better improve an already futuristic space.\n\nIt is always essential to do your own research (\u201cDYOR\u201d) but currently, the signs are all signaling a bull run is on the horizon if it has not already begun. OTC pressure is exceptionally high on the buy side with orders stacking up in the hundreds of millions without sellers wanting to unload. This means that money is trying to enter the market at a pace not being displayed by the current price of crypto assets. Once the billions of dollars do enter the marketplace, the individuals that placed it in will likely make their presence felt, and the next bull run begins.\n\nZCL seems like a very plausible target for another big project as the resulting coin will likely be worth in excess of $40 (as BTCP is). This means ZCL would have to appreciate to the point of or beyond this price to incorporate the value of the upcoming fork. Will a team undertake a new fork of ZCL? Only time will tell.\n\nTo read the King\u2019s prior articles, to find out which ICOs he currently recommends, or to get in contact directly with the King, you can on Twitter (@JbtheCryptoKing) or Reddit (ICO updates and Daily Reports).\n\nYou can read the entire Moonshot series here."

        "title": "This is Why You Need to Start a Side Hustle (and a Few Reasons Why You Shouldn\u2019t)",
        "text": "Side hustles are all the rage. They give you the ability to make money on the side, either within your primary profession or outside of it, and expand your experience in new ways. Plus, many opportunities allow you to work from home, meaning you don\u2019t have to report to an office to get started.\n\nBut, side hustling isn\u2019t always a majestic unicorn full of wonder and opportunity. They are also a lot of work and, just like starting a company, require a substantial amount of time to get off the ground and sustain.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering diving into the world of side hustles, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nAt some point in nearly everyone\u2019s career, you end up at a job that doesn\u2019t make full use of your skills. Maybe you are a software developer who works for a donkey of a company that isn\u2019t interested in embracing the latest technology or would like to branch out into a new programming language. Maybe your a seasoned professional who wants to try your hand at content creation in your niche, allowing you to establish yourself as a thought leader.\n\nRegardless of the precise circumstances, a side hustle gives you the chance to dig in and get your hands dirty in a new arena, and that is very enticing to pros who don\u2019t necessarily want to abandon their current employment arrangement.\n\nOften, you get to pick and choose which gigs you pick up, so you have significantly more control over the direction of your side hustle than you may have in your day-to-day. Plus, it can provide substantially more value than paying for classes as a means of professional development, as those scenarios aren\u2019t always based on the real-world and they can cost you a boatload of cash.\n\nIf you want to grow your skills, and get paid for doing it, side hustling might be right for you.\n\nAny connection you make while side hustling gives you a chance to expand your network. You\u2019ll enter into discussions with a range of professionals representing their companies, and, if you meet or exceed their expectations, you can likely count on them as a connection.\n\nSince so many jobs (both traditional and gig-oriented) can be found through word-of-mouth, a strong professional network is essential. A side hustle can be a great vehicle for growing yours, giving you access to more opportunities for years to come.\n\nNearly everyone has heard why it\u2019s best to diversify your investments, ensuring that, if one thing crashes, you don\u2019t lose everything.\n\nStarting a side hustle can act similarly, giving you the ability to diversify your employment and create a safety net.\n\nNo matter how good you are at your job, or how amazing your employer seems, things go wrong (we all remember what happened at Enron, right?). By starting a side hustle, you can give yourself some level of protection against sudden unemployment or other career-related catastrophes.\n\nWhile a side hustle along might not replace all of your income during extreme situations (though it certainly can, if that\u2019s your goal), it\u2019s usually a lot better to have some money coming in the door than none at all.\n\nBy nature, a side hustle involves trading access to your skills for cold hard cash. That means you can supplement your income while doing something that excites you.\n\nThere are already a number of platforms available that connect professionals with gigs, like Gigster, Upwork, and WriterAccess. Some are incredibly niche while others support large networks of companies looking for individuals to accomplish specific tasks.\n\nAs a bonus, many of the platforms coordinate the payment side of the house, so you don\u2019t have to worry about tasks like invoicing or credit card processing.\n\nNow, you can certainly coordinate things on your own, but you may need to make some investments to get started. For example, if you don\u2019t have invoicing and payment tracking software, then you may need to pony up some funds before you even land your first gig. Luckily, there are a lot of options out there, and some, like QuickBooks, can even be learned for free online.\n\nWhile side hustling represents an exceptional unicorn of an opportunity for many, that doesn\u2019t mean it is right for everyone.\n\nFirst and foremost, keeping a side hustle up and going is hard work. It takes time, energy, and other resources to accomplish any task you take on, so don\u2019t underestimate this part of the equation.\n\nPlus, you need to make sure that a side hustle doesn\u2019t detract from your primary job. When you are working for your employer, they deserve your full attention (after all, that is what they are paying you for) during your shift. If a side hustle is going to distract you from your obligations, forcing you to discretely try to multitask to keep up, it\u2019s better to say no to joining the gig economy.\n\nSimilarly, if your current position is already incredibly demanding, and you feel stretched to the brink more often than not, then adding something else to your plate isn\u2019t a wise move. While a side hustle takes work, it shouldn\u2019t solely represent another stressor in your life. If working more than you already do (even if the tasks intrigues you) would leave you screaming for mercy, back away slowly and only revisit the idea if you\u2019re in a better position to manage a workload increase.\n\nYou may also need to consider whether any non-competes your current (or previous, depending on the amount of time has passed) employer has in place. In some cases, your barred from performing certain kinds of work for others for a specific duration, and violating a non-compete carries serious consequences.\n\nUltimately, side hustles represent great opportunities, but you have to make sure they fit into your life before you take one on. But, if you can jump into the gig economy, it\u2019s certainly worth exploring."

        "text": "The ICO Economy and What You Need to Know About It\n\nIf you\u2019re reading yourself into cryptocurrencies or if you\u2019re in the Crypto space for a while you can\u2019t open your Facebook, Twitter, Google or Medium anymore without reading about the latest amazing ICOs.\n\nWell I\u2019m a fan! But I\u2019m not a fan!\n\nThe concept is great, how startups use it these days, on the other hand, is most of the time, heavily disappointing. Anyhow, let\u2019s talk about the concept and how it makes possible for everyone to invest their money where the top 0.04% of the world puts their money.\n\nThe ICO concept is pretty cool. Never in human history could humanity (even your grandma) buy into a company and:\n\nFor example: If people use Steemit.com, the value of the token goes up as demand increases.\n\nBefore the ICO phenomenon Investing in an early stage startup was possible if you:\n\nBefore the ICO phenomenon the market looked like this:\n\nFor the sake of this article, I assume that you and I are the \u201cAverage investor\u201d. We have a bit of money left on the table and we don\u2019t want to spend it on a liability like the latest TV or a new car so we decide to let our money work for us and we invest in assets.\n\nPart of our money was reserved for \u201cHigh-risk investments\u201d so we take a look at Facebook, Tesla, Alibaba, and Google.\n\nSo Wait a minute. Huh! What do I miss? Where did the other 92.8% of Google shares go during their IPO? Well that\u2019s easy.\n\nPart of those shares went to the team, Larry & Sergey have a bit more shares than Developer #29.458, but what about the rest?\n\nThe rest went to early-stage investors: \u201cAngel Investors\u201d and \u201cVenture Capital firms\u201d.\n\nAngel investors usually provide a one-time investment to help the business propel or an ongoing injection of money (usually from VCs) to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages.\n\nUS-based Angel investors must meet the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) standards for accredited investors. To become an angel investor, one must have a minimum net worth of $1 million and an annual income of $200,000.\n\nLast time I checked. 99.96% of the world population doesn\u2019t make > $200.000/year and therefore doesn\u2019t fall into the category \u201cpotential Angel Investor\u201d.\n\nVenture Capital firms get the biggest slice of the IPO pie. They put in vast amounts of money into multiple startups. Many of them fail, a couple of them do pretty well, and a couple of those become the next Google or Facebook.\n\nThat\u2019s before the ICO phenomenon. You (assuming you belong to the 99.x % of the world, and assuming you don\u2019t work for a promising startup that gives out shares yourself) don\u2019t have the opportunity to invest in early-stage startups.\n\nSo you could ask yourself:\n\nReality is that even if the above was answered as \u201cYes we make that possible / Yes the SEC would allow this\u201d it wouldn\u2019t be feasible.\n\nHow do you keep track of all those mini shares thousands of people have in your company. It\u2019s just not feasible.\n\nThe ICO solves this issue. Well the ICO itself doesn\u2019t solve that issue but the \u201cToken\u201d does.\n\nICO stands for Initial Coin offering. Though the crypto community didn\u2019t fully make up their minds on this, actually the term is wrong. It should be an ITO: Initial Token Offering. Anyway, since ICO is the common term it doesn\u2019t make any sense to change it now.\n\nA Coin in the crypto community is a digital currency. A token, on the other hand, is a programmable digital currency/way to store value/a lot more (see below \u201chow about the token, what\u2018s so special about it?\u201d\n\nTokens are those things that all these ICOs give away in return for another cryptocurrency or fiat money.\n\nTokens can be created by building a so called DAPP (Decentralised Application) on platforms like: Ethereum, Waves & NEO.\n\nOr some of the less familiar ones: Qtum / NXT / UbiQ / Counterparty / Omni / Metaverse ETP and in the future probably EOS / Lisk.\n\nThere\u2019s one exception to the rule. It\u2019s Bancor, if their platform will be finished one day, everyone can create \u201cSmart tokens\u201d.\n\nTokens that can be created out of thin air and can hold a reserve in another coin or token. The system is kind of complicated but interesting on the long run.\n\nDuring the ICO, a smart contract makes it possible to exchange crypto currency for tokens. Do note that you can build DAPPs without issuing tokens.\n\nThe token works simple: You give a company money, the company gives you a token/tokens in return;\n\nIf the company\u2019s token is good, other people want the token, demand grows, price goes up.\n\nIn other words: Now it\u2019s possible to be an investor and invest < $1 in an early stage startup without any administrative hassle.\n\nAll of the sudden you can have your company funded by everyone who believes in it and you can reward everyone for doing so without to much administrative hassle.\n\nOn top of that all your token holders are stored on the blockchain. There\u2019s no discussion anymore if somebody holds a token or not.\n\nPreviously I used \u201cEarly stage startups\u201d and \u201ccompanies\u201d as an example in this article but there\u2019s a ton of other interesting high-risk options that the 0.04% invest their money in and that are currently not accessible.\n\nActually, it gets even more interesting. Everyone can create tokens. Take for example your local bakery. They can create tokens and sell them.\n\nThe bakery creates new funds to expand the store and buy some new ovens. In return, the token could give you a nice discount on your daily bread and an end of year dividend on the Bakery\u2019s profit.\n\nWait! It\u2019s even more interesting: Tokens could also figure as a discount coupon or point system. Burger King recently launched a token to do \u201cjust that\u201d.\n\nIn short: We could potentially create tokens for everything. Every service, every store, every product, every asset, etc.\n\nAs with every new revolution, especially when there\u2019s money to be made, there are always people who take advantage of it.\n\nI wrote a nice piece on: What\u2019s wrong with most ICOs, Currently ICOs just don\u2019t make any sense at all! and a possible solution could be the IPCO model, I wrote about it here.\n\nAnd since complaining is for people who are not looking for the solutions I\u2019ll come up with possible solutions in my next articles.\n\nFor now, please share your thoughts on this article. I\u2019m really curious about your thoughts on ICOs, tokens and the possible opportunities you see now we have this new medium of fundraising and making people part of our businesses.\n\nOn another note: Are you as excited about the Crypto Market as me?\n\nIt would be great if you could help me out and let me know your thoughts on our startup: CoinCheckup.com"

        "title": "Why I Focus on a Single Source of Traffic for My Blog",
        "text": "In the last three weeks, my focus was on analyzing my Medium stats data. That taught me a lot of lessons on blogging. There is still a lot to be studied and learned from my Medium stats.\n\nMedium is a critical part of my content marketing model. Excluding my blog and email newsletter, 90+% of my blog promotion efforts go to Medium at the moment.\n\nMy main objective is not to build a successful Medium account. My main objective is to build a successful content marketing business. A successful Medium account is a part of it.\n\nThis week, I want to analyze how my efforts on Medium serve my overall marketing goals. To do that, I will use Google Analytics stats of my blog. I will focus on the data of the last 30 days.\n\nThe First Step to Use Google Analytics\n\nI\u2019m not going to explain how to install and use Google Analytics (GA). I\u2019m going to explain what to do with it. Once you know \u201cwhat,\u201d you can google \u201chow.\u201d\n\nThe first step to use GA is to exclude your internal traffic from the data. We don\u2019t want our own usage to affect the results. The usage of a website admin is completely different than the usage of the average visitor. You can see that in Fig. 1 below.\n\nHow do I filter myself out of Google Analytics?\n\nTo find different ways of filtering your own traffic, google \u201cGoogle Analytics exclude internal traffic\u201d or \u201chow to filter myself out of Google Analytics.\u201d\n\nI created a segment and filter all the views using that segment. The segment I use is Demographics, Location, City, \u201cdoes not exactly match\u201d, the name of my city. I call this segment Not My City.\n\nThis solution doesn\u2019t take into account mobile usage, but I don\u2019t use mobile data to access my blog that often. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t take into account my usage when I travel.\n\nMy method of excluding my internal traffic is simple but not perfect. I have to find a better method in the future.\n\nWhat is the share of Medium in my blog traffic sources?\n\nI\u2019m worried about being too dependent on Medium for traffic.\n\nIn the last ten years, I\u2019ve seen multiple Google algorithm changes that destroyed many online businesses. I don\u2019t blame Google for that. They have to do what\u2019s best for their business and for their users.\n\nMedium made some recent changes in their algorithm. The new algorithm seems to prefer timeless, evergreen content. I can already feel those changes in my stats.\n\nMy older Medium posts receive more hits than my recent posts. This is bad in the short term, but great in the long term.\n\nI learned a lot in the last few months about converting Medium readers to email newsletter subscribers. I applied those lessons in my recent posts. Now, those recent posts receive less traffic.\n\nI don\u2019t write time-sensitive content. I try to write timeless, evergreen content. Eventually, my new posts are going to receive their fair share of traffic as well.\n\nOverall, I like the new algorithm more than the old one, even though sign ups to my newsletter dropped in the short term.\n\nWhy I Focus on Medium at the Moment\n\nEven though I don\u2019t like being dependent on a single traffic source, 90+% of my content marketing efforts go into my Medium account.\n\nThis might look like a contradiction and a mistake on my site. Yet, it\u2019s a conscious choice. At this moment, I have two options.\n\nI chose the first option. Optimizing my Medium account results in learning a lot of lessons on blogging. If I don\u2019t learn those lessons, my blog posts will suck. If my blog posts suck, it doesn\u2019t matter how much I promote them in other channels.\n\nA Useful Tip for New Content Marketers\n\nIf you\u2019re a new content marketer like me, I recommend that you focus on a single channel and learn as much as you can about that single channel. This is an advice I heard from Gary Vaynerchuk and John Chow.\n\nContent marketing is a side project for me. I have limited time that I can invest in this project. Therefore, I need to find the most valuable activities to invest my limited time in. Optimizing my Medium account has been that valuable activity for me.\n\nBlogging doesn\u2019t have to be your primary medium. Maybe it\u2019s vlogging for you. Maybe, it\u2019s podcasting. Maybe, it\u2019s Instagram, Twitter, a Facebook page, or a Facebook group.\n\nThis is a decision you have to make. Check my post called To Vlog or To Blog? That\u2019s the Question for the First Time Online Marketer on this topic.\n\nInvest at Least Six Months to Your Primary Medium\n\nOnce you determine your primary medium, I recommend that you invest at least six months in perfecting your craft in that medium.\n\nI invested five months in blogging and Medium. I learned a lot in those first five months. Yet, I\u2019m nowhere near the optimal. I still learn something new every day.\n\nI\u2019ll keep focusing on blogging and Medium for at least another three months. Maybe more. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll stay focused on this medium for the rest of my career. That\u2019s how much I like it.\n\nWe spend four years on a college degree to get a job to make a living. Yet, most of the first time online marketers expect to make a living after the first month.\n\nMaybe, you should invest at least three years into this craft before making a living off it.\n\nHow Dependent Is My Blog on Medium?\n\nI thought that the traffic of my blog was at least 80% dependent on Medium. According to the Google Analytics stats, that figure turned out to be only 35%. That\u2019s still high, but nowhere near the 80% that I suspected. That\u2019s good news.\n\nIt is also possible that the remaining 65% comes indirectly from Medium. Here are a few indirect ways Medium might have contributed to my blog traffic.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea to depend on a single source of traffic, if you have an established business.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out like me, it\u2019s OK to focus on a single medium and a single channel. That teaches you a lot of lessons that you can apply to other media and channels.\n\nIn my case, I was lucky to choose Medium. It not only sent me direct traffic, it also contributed to my blog traffic in many indirect ways.\n\nI\u2019m going to dive into my Google Analytics stats further and report my findings here. So, stay tuned for more on this topic."

        "text": "We\u2019re all passionate about something that goes beyond our full-time day job.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s writing. All different kinds of writing.\n\nI came up with the idea of this post during a Saturday stroll. My mind tends to be more creative in the least expected times. It\u2019s when there\u2019s no pressure of thinking that you open up your mind to any suggestion. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always carrying around a notebook.\n\nWithout even realising it, I started drafting notes an hour later on my ride home. I started writing at a speed that my hand couldn\u2019t handle (maybe the caffeine also helped on this) ending up with most of the notes from this post.\n\nWriting has always been a passion for me.\n\nWhat\u2019s a passion then in this case?\n\nAnd still, we can use this passion to explore its potential.\n\nA passion can become a side hustle if you start getting paid for practicing it. An additional income is always welcome, but in fact, this shouldn\u2019t be the primary motivation to continue your practice.\n\nIf you start focusing on the monetary compensation, you may easily lose your interest in your passion. Why is that? Because it can lose its importance through a different currency of value.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to ignore it and you\u2019re willing to explore how far it can take you.\n\nThat\u2019s where hustling comes in.\n\nIt\u2019s the stage that you turn your passion into actionable steps that will help you master it. It is the ability to take your passion to the next level and you\u2019ll be able to explore your potential. And most importantly, it is the stage that you acknowledge your skill and you want to improve yourself even more. (And yes, it\u2019s also the stage that you start getting paid for it, but as we said, this is not always the most important reason for this shift.)\n\nIt\u2019s called \u2018side-hustling\u2019 because you can still work on your full-time job while experimenting with different paths.\n\nNow there\u2019s the next big question.\n\nHow can you work both on your full-time job and your side hustle?\n\nWhen you work 40 or 50 hours per week, it sounds almost impossible to find time for your side hustle. You come back home from work exhausted and all you want to do on the weekends is to spend time with your family and friends.\n\nHow can you fit another project into your busy schedule?\n\nIt\u2019s not as hard as it sounds. At least, not if you\u2019re really passionate about it.\n\nWhen we think of additional income and side hustling, we think of it as a job. That\u2019s the easiest way to lose your motivation and postpone the work. It\u2019s good to remind yourself that this is still your passion. Nobody is asking you to do it, you\u2019re only doing it because you enjoy it.\n\nAnd if you are already paid to do it, which means that you have some obligations associated with it, you can still remind yourself that this started as a passion. It should still have its initial sparkle, even in a different form. As with your talent, the practice can keep it alive.\n\nThe difference between a passion and a side hustle is that the second requires discipline. It\u2019s when you start taking yourself and your talent seriously enough to make time for it.\n\nYou push yourself to become better and that\u2019s wonderful.\n\nDiscipline should not be taken for granted.\n\nSome days are harder than others. But if you still encourage yourself to show up in your craft, then many great things can happen.\n\nI\u2019ve heard many people through the years from different backgrounds telling me that they\u2019d like to blog more often.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got lots of ideas in my mind, but I never find the time to write a post\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that Medium is good for my personal brand, but I tend to forget it among all my tasks\u201d\n\nIn a similar context, have you ever had an amazing idea but never chased it enough to turn it into action?\n\nWhat if you suddenly see someone else turning it into action?\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be devastated by the lost opportunity. You can still use such instances to try harder. This might be the push to take your passion to the next level by being more creative and productive.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s not always the talent that makes us successful but the will to keep trying and turning an idea into action.\n\nUse your talent to keep practicing your passion, this time by treating it as a side hustle. Prove to yourself and to everyone else that you\u2019re serious about it.\n\nPush yourself one step at a time to try something new. Find what makes you stand out and use it to your advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s your story that sets you apart from everyone else. Start \u2018writing it down\u2019 through your passion. Don\u2019t let your story stay trapped in your head and side hustling should help you in this direction. It urges you to chase your dream, to keep working towards achieving it. And this cannot be achieved without authenticity.\n\nStart seeing opportunities everywhere. Be open to what\u2019s coming up and don\u2018t just stick to the plan. Yes, you need the structure when switching from a passion to a side hustle, but it\u2019s the gut feeling that will help you discover new paths that you haven\u2019t necessarily planned in advance.\n\nAs everything starts from your inner desire to chase your passion, the destination is still unknown. And that\u2019s both scary and exciting. It\u2019s up to you to pick how you react to these feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s common to think that hustling should be linked with overworking. This approach will probably lead you to a burnout and this is not fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is to find a balance between all the bits of your life that will keep you happy and healthy.\n\nJob, family, friends, free time, side hustle. How do you find time for all of them?\n\nThere\u2019s no perfect formula, but the burnout is definitely not the answer.\n\nIt\u2019s all about splitting the time to the bits that matter most, depending on the day, the week, the month and the priorities you\u2019re setting.\n\nFind what works better for you and move at your own pace. Block some time in the week to focus on your passion and call it a side hustle by adding the necessary discipline to keep it going.\n\nThe most important benefit from calling your passion a side hustle is that you start taking it seriously. It adds up structure to the motivation and the combination can lead to amazing results.\n\nHere are 10 points to keep in mind:\n\nIf you enjoy reading my posts, subscribe to my newsletter to receive an email every month."

        "text": "Whenever you want to try something new, it\u2019s reasonable to run an experiment. Whether you\u2019re learning how to use Facebook Ads to market a specific product, trying to get into the gym more, writing more, trying to grow a social media following, doing meal prep, or anything else. Whatever it is, the most important thing is the followthrough, and it is the lack of followthrough is what causes most people to never end up getting a positive result from such experiments, and to chalk them up as \u201csomething that didn\u2019t work out\u201d.\n\nWhen adding anything new into your life, whether it\u2019s something personal, something professional, or otherwise, it won\u2019t be a habit right away. And of course, by definition, anything new can be hard to fully figure out or grasp quickly, and you have the frustrating initial part of the learning curve where you feel that you shouldn\u2019t even bother.\n\nWhether you just fall out of interest with whatever you\u2019re trying to learn or do consistently, or you start skimping on the consistency to the point where you hardly do that thing, or you decide it\u2019s not for you \u2014 you need to have given it a good shot. Results with anything will not come quickly or really be that obvious (unless you\u2019re lucky). You need to expand the timeframe for which you\u2019re going to be trying something, and realize that nothing will change overnight.\n\nYou won\u2019t become an expert in something, or extremely fit, or an amazing writer in a week or a month. Your ability to keep chugging along despite how disheartening it can be at the early stages is what will provide real growth in an area over time. Giving up on an experiment before you can understand meaningful results is not doing the experiment justice. Anything worth doing, as the saying goes, is worth doing right.\n\nOf course, there is no one-size-fits-all determination of how long to keep any kind of experiment going. That part is up to you \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be longer than you think. You can take an educated guess by doing research on others doing the same process. If you want to write, there are a ton of articles on Medium about different people\u2019s writing journeys. If you want to grow a social media following then you can look at the stories of how larger accounts got off the ground. If you want to run a marathon, you look at a reasonable training routine and about how other runners achieved it.\n\nGive a reasonable goal and progress milestones that, if not met, can indicate that the experiment is not for you and that you should move your time and efforts to something else. In doing so, it\u2019s also vital to actually be aware of progress. This is much easier in certain more quantitative goals, where a number is the primary indication of progress. The important thing is to accept that the progress won\u2019t be some major breakthrough that\u2019s totally obvious to yourself and those around. Most progress is clearest in retrospect.\n\nExperiments also tend to work better when there is a clear vision for the path forward, and a goal that you are working backwards from. Hence why I used the common marathon example before: it\u2019s a very clear goal that naturally lends itself to working backwards from the end result. Certain other experiments are more difficult to think of in this way. If you want to start a small side hustle providing consulting services, there\u2019s not an obvious specific goal there. You have to think of what is reasonable \u2014 a good goal to reach but not too extreme so as to be too lofty to attain without many, many years of effort and luck.\n\nTo sum it up, abandoning an experiment early gives you very little benefit. By choosing to try to be good at something, or to achieve something, you need to actually try. Doing many things at once and \u201cseeing what sticks\u201d is going to cause the issue that you\u2019re not trying anything for a reasonable length of time, or giving a reasonable amount of effort, to actually see if any one thing will success. Choose carefully what you want to be good at, and stick with the process. Stop ending experiments early, and you\u2019ll be a step closer to getting to your goals."

        "text": "Imagine a person with a rare genetic disorder in some corner of the world. Possibly with little access to advanced medical technology. A possible way to treat the patient is by acquiring more knowledge about the disorder. By acquiring I mean, studying the characteristics of the people diagnosed with the same disorder so that a pattern may be established to determine on what parameters is the disorder based.\n\nHowever, there are a few problems in getting this genetic data. The first problem is finding the data. In case that the disorder is extremely rare, we may not even know where the person diagnosed with same disorder is. So it may prove impossible to get access to his data. The second problem is of privacy. The genomic data, according to laws in many countries, doesn\u2019t have a clear legal owner, making it possible for anyone who gets the data to share it anywhere, violating the privacy of the patient.\n\nBlockchain solves both the mentioned problems. Blockchain is basically an append-only list of blocks containing data. In a blockchain implemented system, every person will be given a unique identity. So we can access the data of anything from anywhere, as long as we are authorized to do so. Blockchain not only allows participants to share their data with the people they want to, they can also control what to share\n\nand what not to, thus solving the problem of privacy to a great extent. Blockchain is a decentralized peer to peer network, thus preventing any individual or group of individuals from controlling the policies of the network.\n\nThere can be many more applications of Blockchain in genomics apart from sharing the data on disorders. The data that has been collected can be used for determining genetic patterns among different types of populations. This may allow the researchers to understand the genetics of disease origins and also the changes in the genetics responsive to medical drugs. Blockchain network makes accessing the data much easier, also covering populations from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe participants in blockchain can choose whether to participate and share their data, for research purposes, allowing which may help in developing better medical technologies and thereby resulting in curing the disorder in a much better way. Also, blockchain lowers the risk of data tampering with its highly efficient cryptographic blocks.\n\nInformation that is obtained by processing the data on genomic sequencing can be used to evaluate genetic factors that are important in conserving key species. The data can be used to evaluate the effects of biological processes on the given species, thus helping the environmentalists to plan policies to help a given species. Blockchain helps to access this data easily and efficiently.\n\nGenomics has many applications other than healthcare, too. Blockchain can help revolutionize this sector through the advantages it brings to the table.\n\nSamyak can be reached at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammyak-sangai-8ba835104/\n\nDr. Sukant Khurana runs an academic research lab and several tech companies.

        "text": "\u201cBlockchain is the only remedy to our problem. It provides transparency and is secure in nature.\n\nI was on my way to Mr. Bala\u2019s place when I came across a chaotic group of people quarrelling amongst themselves. When I went up to them to intervene, one of them told me that it was nothing new at all and that this was a matter of every day that such fights happen.\n\n\u201cThis is not for the first time that we\u2019re not receiving the medicines as we should. It\u2019s the middlemen who actually don\u2019t let us receive medical benefits. There\u2019s corruption everywhere in the system. When one goes to the CMO, all he says is that the medicines have been dispatched; on the contrary, if one approaches the Drug Distributors to receive them, they tell us that they don\u2019t have any medicines.\u201d, remarked somebody else from the crowd.\n\nI went to Mr. Bala\u2019s place and narrated him what I came across on the way.\n\nTo this, he almost immediately replied,\n\n\u201cBlockchain is the solution to all such issues.\u201d\n\nUpon asking him to tell me more about \u201cBlockchain\u201d, he told me it is the best remedy to prevent and detect acts of pilferage and counterfeit carried out by third parties.\n\nI reached back home from Mr. Bala\u2019s, the memories of the incident still etched deep in my head, I researched \u201cBlockchain\u201d and even devised a curative scheme to curb pilferages and eliminate inefficiency.\n\nHaving made up my mind to bring about reforms in the system, I pay a visit to the CMO of our region to talk to him about the inefficiency of the system and propose the scheme I devised to put an end to such malpractices.\n\nHaving listened to me with utmost consideration, the CMO asked me to explain the very concept of \u201cBlockchain\u201d.\n\nCan you tell me what Blockchain is?\n\nYou can consider it as a common ledger which is visible to everyone within your organization, but you can restrict the visibility of sections as per your choice. Apart from that, it\u2019s almost tamperproof and irreversible in nature.\n\nLet us take a practical example of the current scenario. (fig. 1.1)\n\nIn our current model, there are three entities \u2013\n\nInitially, you used to allot some fund to the drug distributor in order to provide the drug retailers with drugs so that it can be distributed among the needy ones.\n\nIn spite of your such great efforts, the results were not satisfactory i.e. the needy ones were still deprived of the necessary drugs.\n\nReasons behind this may include:\n\n1.) Illegitimate addition or removal of a transaction either from the drug retailer or the drug distributor.\n\n2.) Insufficient fund sanctioned to the drug distributor via CMO.\n\n3.) Drug retailer sold those medicines and added counterfeited transactions to their own ledger.\n\nLet me introduce you to its Blockchain model: (fig 1.2)\n\nBlockchain provides you with four indispensable features:\n\n1) Consensus \u2014 It replicates everything and updates everyone about what is going on within the network.\n\n2) Provenance \u2014 It keeps track for \u201cpoint of origin for a transaction\u201d.\n\n3) Finality \u2014 Guarantee on maintaining the original state of history.\n\n4) Immutability \u2014 It\u2019s almost impossible to change the details of any transaction.\n\nSo, it\u2019s almost impossible to modify previous transactions and due to the property of consensus, everyone will be aware of what is happening within the network. Thus, those vulnerable cases aren\u2019t available in it.\n\nCan you prepare a prototype of it? So that we can further take an action on it.\n\nSure! I\u2019ll be back with a live prototype soon.\n\nBefore we dive in the depth of development we first need to recall the definition of Blockchain.\n\nBlockchains heart contains a peer to peer distributed ledger that is immutable, append-only and is cryptographically secure and it pumps out only when a consensus was well established among the peers.\n\nThis gives us an idea of \u201cHow a block must be implemented so that all the properties to maintain the integrity of a blockchain is satisfied\u201d.\n\nBut wait! What a block is?\n\nA Block is a primordial piece of a blockchain which reserves the information of transactions and are connected to its previous neighbour (Exception: Genesis Block, which is an initial one) by the means of a hash pointer.\n\nThis is how a standard block looks like:\n\nHash / Addresses: are unique combination of numbers and alphabets known as identifiers which identifies who is a sender or receiver in a blockchain.\n\nTransactions: Which represents a transfer of some value from one end to another end.\n\nBut wait! Before we prove out immutability of a the blockchain. There is one more question which needs our attention?\n\nHow those Hashes were generated?\n\nThey are generated by a sophisticated hash function.\n\nHash function: is a mathematical function which transforms input data into a fingerprint which is known as a hash.\n\nThe speciality of a hash function is its ability to mutate any length of data (may include a large byte from a stream or just a single character) into a fixed length one.\n\nWhich is same in length.\n\nTwo inevitable properties of it include:\n\n2) Hard to retrieve original data back from the hash.\n\nSince all the blocks were interconnected. A trial to mutate the data of a block may result out in the recalculation of all those hashes to which it was connected. Thus a byzantine node results in the destruction of the chain.\n\nEg: If the chain includes 40000 blocks and the targeted block is 1900. Then all the hashes of blocks from 1901 to 40000 are recalculated. Apart from that, it\u2019s not the only measure used by ablockchain to protect itself from the data infringement. It requires some proof of work (a specific amount of computational power required to mine a block) (All thanks to merkele patricia tree).\n\nIt proves that data is almost immutable in blockchains.\n\nLet us head back to the scenario of drug distribution counterfeiting\n\nThe government has been added to provide better consensus.\n\nTry to replace all the nodes with the blocks. Transactions are now being stored within them. L1 represents a genesis block. L2, L3 and L4 contain a specific nonce counter and each one contains a hash pointer which points to its ancestor.\n\nOne thing is still missing? Try to guess that?\n\nRight! We are talking about logic. To be more precise it\u2019s called as a business logic.\n\nA Business logic maintains communication between a database and its end user. Main components of it includes business rules and workflows. Business rules, as the name suggests are specific procedures, while a workflow contains those procedural steps that are needed to implement our business logic.\n\nIn the world of blockchain those business logics were replaced by independent programs called as Smart contracts.\n\nLet us get more into it.\n\nSmart contracts were first came into the existence by Nick Szabo in late 90s. According to him:\n\n\u201cA Smart contract can be defined as a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. While the goal is to satisfy common contract environments (such as payment terms), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include minimizing fraud, arbitrations, enforcement costs and other transaction costs.\u201d\n\nSmart contract provide us with the power of maintaining distributed consensus mechanism. While Ethereum provides us necessary support to deploy smart contracts.\n\nTrust \u2014 Information is encrypted within a shared ledger. Thus, no way to either manipulate the same or to lose them. It also forms the basis of backup as each node contains a replica of data.\n\nSavings \u2014 It helps to eliminate additional intermediaries within your business network.\n\nAccuracy and Security \u2014 As it contains the business rules. It enforces every node on the business network to pass through the same. If anyone fails to do so, then he has treated accordingly to the rules. Accuracy is inherited, as the management becomes entirely autonomous.\n\nThus, we need a Smart contract in our chain to maintain the flow as well as security.\n\nOkay! Now it\u2019s your turn!\n\nTry to think some rules from your own and write up everything On a piece of paper.\n\nKeep this paper in a safe place.\n\nDo remember that these rules are equally applicable to every participant within the chain!\n\nSome rules were already WRITTEN FOR SAMPLE.\n\nEthereum is a distributed public blockchain network and was first conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in November 2013. He abstracted the Ethereum as a Turing-complete language that enables the development of smart contracts for blockchain and decentralized applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum clients have been developed with many languages. But, the most popular one is geth (go-Ethereum). Geth is a multiutility command line interface for running full Ethereum nodes.\n\n\u2022 Frontier phase: Represents network in its simplest and unsecured form.\n\n\u2022 Metropolis phase: The upcoming phase, which focuses on protocol simplification and performance improvement.\n\n\u2022 Serenity phase: The final phase, which is supposed to have Proof of Stake as an algorithm.\n\nLet us now try to encapsulate all the core concepts including Transactions and Gas through an analogy.\n\nYou surely be wondering about \u201cWhat a red car with an ether mascot is doing on the front cover\u201d?\n\nEverything, which is included in this module has a definite meaning.\n\nLet me introduce you to \u201cEtherbuggy\u201d.\n\nThe only transportation network in our blockchain world (Just like Ola). Etherbuggy helps you to transfer data, message and money from one end to another end. All you need to do is to download their application on your mobile and deploy it.\n\nWhen you first launch the application, it pops open a tab named Transactions.\n\nJargon: Here Etherbuggy is known as an Ethereum client.\n\nThis tab includes a form which has:\n\n1.)Nonce: This includes a counter which increments every time when a booking (Transaction) is performed. If it\u2019s the first time then it simply shows 0 as you haven\u2019t used this app before.\n\n2) To: It\u2019s the field where you need to put the address of the second party\n\n3) Value: It\u2019s the amount which you want to transfer.\n\n4) Gaslimit: This is an awesome feature in this app. It allows you to set a restriction to the amount of fuel.\n\n5) Init: It\u2019s an optional field which gives you the ability to upload a set of rules.\n\n6) Data: If you want to pass a message then leave it here.\n\nAfter that. Application prompts up a form which shows all the fields which we filled here with two more additions:\n\n7) Gasprice: It represents the amount (wei) which is need to execute this transaction.\n\n8) Signature: When you click it. It generates a digital signature for you. It required to authenticate the transaction.\n\nIt also generates a hyperlink for advanced users. Clicking on it will reveal additional details about signature.\n\nOur Signatures are based on ECDSA and internally uses SECP256k1 curve.\n\nSignatures are made of three fields: (However cryptography is almost out of scope for this article)\n\nV \u2014 A single byte value that shows size and sign of elliptic curve point. It is used as a recovery key to extract out transaction.\n\nR \u2014 It\u2019s derived by a point on the curve. A Random number is selected and multiplied with the curve generator. X coordinate of it will produce R. R is a 32 byte sequence here.\n\nS \u2014 Calculated by the multiplication of R with the private key and appending it with the hash of the message. Finally divide it with the same random number by which R is generated.\n\nLast column shows a summarized bill in the format \u2013\n\nTotal cost = gasUsed (amount of gas which is estimated for the transaction) * gasPrice(Your decided gas price)\n\nAfter clicking on confirm it shows you the payment options.\n\nWait? What \u2014 It only has one option which is ether?\n\nRight! Our blockchain network only excepts ether. Because it\u2019s the only currency on this planet which is excepted.\n\nEther is extracted by miners. Miners are just like path finders. If they found any problem within the network, they immediately report the authority (EVM) to take further actions. Thus, They help to secure the network. In reality, they are used to verify the validity of transactions and blocks. It is required as the payment for execution of contracts and every operation in our chain. It is used to purchase gas for the cars running in etherbuggy.\n\nIs it means that I must be a miner first to complete the transaction?\n\nYes. It\u2019s partly true. But there is a posibility of currency exchange. You can exchange your real currency through some specialized portals and they convert your money into ether.\n\nOkay! Let us now click on Deploy.\n\nNow the app waits for some drivers to pick your escrow.\n\nAfter the deployment. There are exactly two cases:\n\n1) Someone pick your order and ready to perform your work.\n\n2) No one accept your offer.\n\nWhy? Maybe drivers doesn\u2019t lured by your offer.Reasons may include low monetary gain from your deal. Do you remember the total cost? Higher the value of total cost the higher the chance a driver may pick it up.\n\nJargon: Here drivers are miners. Miners are responsible for your transactions.\n\nLet us now investigate some conditions:\n\nIn this case, Transaction will complete and the value equal to the remaining gas will be refunded to the originator of transaction.\n\n2) The Car stops in the middle of a route.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the car will stop in the middle of transaction may due to a shortage of gas fuel or the path to which the driver was enforced to travel on is too long that it consumed the entire fuel.\n\nJargon: Here the enforced route shows the use of the smart contract. Smart contract bends the workflow accordingly to the conditions\n\n3) Driver accepts the escrow , but doesn\u2019t reach the destination because of the complexity of rules.\n\nYes! Sometimes your contract may confuse the entire evm (Ethereum virtual machine) which results in the out of gas on the same spot.\n\nNow we got enough information for implementation and we\u2019ll cover additional details in the next section. Let us prepare our weapons to begin a war.\n\nFinally, we are in the development section.\n\nTo join the race of Ethereum development. We first need to create an Ethereum node.\n\nEthereum node in its primordial form is a device that is connected to Ethereum network.\n\nTo declare a device as an Ethereum node. We need to use Ethereum clients.\n\nHere is a list of popular ones:\n\nWe are going to stick with geth.\n\nAs explained previously, It is a command line tool which runs an Ethereum node. It provides three interfaces.\n\nWe are using a Linux distro \u2014 Ubuntu to show the installation of geth. You can find the extended article here to install it on another platform.\n\nAs geth is not endorsed or certified with official repository of ubuntu. We need to import its personal package archive with apt.\n\nGood! So, we got ethereum command line geth in our machine. All we need to do now is to type geth on the command line to sync and update peers. It takes a lot of time to sync the entire blockchain. Sit back and utilize your time somewhere else.\n\nEthereum involves three kind of setup which includes Test-net, Private Net and Parity. Test-net or Rospsten is used by\n\ndevelopers as a test platform to debug or test smart contracts. While the private net in Ethereum allows the deployment of private network that can be used as a distributed ledger.\n\nParity is out of scope right now.\n\nIt\u2019s better to deploy a private network here.\n\nPrivate net provides you with the power to deploy a brand new blockchain of your own. Under the hood, It uses three components:\n\nAlert: Disable node discovery. It\u2019s really essential to disable the discovery of your blockchain to make it entirely private. Let us unfold above terms now:\n\nPrivate blockchain doesn\u2019t contain any block on its own. It\u2019s our responsibility to initiate the first block (Genesis block). To generate it, you need to create a json file which is known as genesis file. This file contains custom fields which are required to transform the nature of our first block. It provides protection against other nodes on the internet which can take part in the consensus mechanism by comparing the genesis block.\n\nHere is how it looks:\n\nHere is the explaination of each term:\n\nThis is the directory where all the blockchain data for Ethereum network is stored.\n\nThere are many flags available out of which:\n\n\u2014 rpc -> used to enable remote procedure calls in geth \u2014 port -> used to define other port for listening.\n\n\u2014 nodiscover -> This flag stops the discovery of nodes automatically.\n\nLet us now create our own initial block.\n\nYou need to manual create a data directory.\n\nInitialize a directory by mkdir and name it as blockdata\n\nThis signifies that the private network has been established successfully.\n\nThere are two ways to interact with our blockchain:\n\nLet us attach a console with our previously deployed blockchain using ipc (interprocess communication).\n\nAs it is still a brand new blockchain. It doesn\u2019t have any accounts in it. To show the list of the accounts.\n\nI\u2019m going to set my account as my main beneficiary which is known as etherbase:\n\nOkay! Now we have our etherbase. Let us check if there is any balance in it. miner.getBalance(eth.coinbase)\n\nHuh? A zero as usual. Let us mine some currency for business. miner.start(no_of_threads)\n\nIt\u2019s the right time to explain the mining:\n\nA miner performs the foll-owing operations at root level\n\nAn Ommer is a block whose parent is equal to the current block\u2019s grandparent. They are used to increase decentralization of the chain as well as distributing rewards to miners.\n\nAs Ethereum is built to provide lower block times than other blockchains. There is a possibility that two miners can discover the same block at an instant.\n\nThis discovery generates the uncles or \u201corphaned blocks\u201d. They increase the difficulty of blockchain and rewards the miners.\n\nHowever, the reward is quite small than the full block.\n\nOne more question? Ask.\n\nIf Difficulty increases with time, then why don\u2019t miners just startup their own chain within the network? After all it will reward them much faster?\n\nWow! Nice question! To answer this thing, let me introduce you the black ops team of Ethereum. The \u201cGHOST\u201d (Greedy heaviest observed subtree). Now consider a blockchain, in which somehow your miners started their own branch.\n\nLet the red node shows the current progression point of miners. Such branching in the blockchain is called \u201cfork\u201d. It is injuries for the health of blockchain. To defeat such uneven forking GHOST applies a rule on the entire chain which says \u2013\n\n\u201cTRUE PATH ALWAYS HAS A HIGHEST VALUE OF COMPUTATION\u201d\n\nTo determine that path we will use the block number of the leaf block that clearly shows the total number of blocks. Longer the path, greater the mining effort , higher the value of computation.\n\nOhh! I almost forgot to stop the miner,\n\nThat\u2019s enough with the console. Let us introduce our second phase of interactivity.\n\nMist is an integrated electron app which is a hybrid of desktop and web app. It gives us the power of faster development by making the interaction user friendly with a GUI.\n\nYou can download the mist from their official repository https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases Extract the mist archive into blockdata folder\n\nTo launch a mist instance. You need to give a remote procedure call to a private chain\n\n./<directory of mist>/mist \u2013rpc ./<path of the ipc file>/geth.ipc Man! It worked.\n\nWait for it to sync the node and launch the app.\n\nWelcome to the mist dashboard.\n\nCan you see the ether balance of our mining?\n\nDo you remember our problem?\n\nLet us create four accounts and name them accordingly.\n\nMake sure to name etherbase as Government.\n\nNow we can easily transfer our balance from one end to another.\n\nI think we forgot something?:\n\nOhh! Smart contracts! Yes! Be ready with that page!\n\nLet\u2019s jump right into them.\n\nSolidity is a statically typed high level language used to write smart contracts. It\u2019s meant to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. There are many platforms on which Solidity can be compiled and here we are going to use \u201cRemix \u2014 A browser based IDE for Solidity\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s get started with an example.\n\nThe first line of code says it is written to run on version 0.4.0 or superior of solidity. It confirms that the smart contract is going to act same in all the versions of solidity newer than 0.4.0.\n\nThe keyword pragma is used to give instructions to the compiler. A contract with reference to Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that is present at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Above a contract named \u2018Test\u2019 has been created with data as a state of uint type. There are both setter and getter methods present in the contract namely set() and get() respectively.\n\nContracts in Solidity are analogous to the classes in object-oriented languages. Any contract can contain declarations of the type variables of state, events, functions, modifiers of function, enums and structs, although it is designed around the syntax of ES(ECMAScript) so that it is familiar to the existing web developers; unlike ES it has static typing and different return types. Complex member variables are supported for contracts that may contain arbitrary-hierarchical structures and mappings. There are variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the contract. They are :-\n\nmsg.sig (bytes4): first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier) msg.value (uint): number of wei sent with the message tx.origin (address): sender of the transaction (full call chain)\n\nLet\u2019s code out the conditions according to that page which we have created before.\n\nThen we will deploy the contract.\n\nEthereum is a gateway to deploy both public and private blockchain.\n\nethereum opened a new dimension of web apps which were more secure yet faster in speed. A new era has began with web 3.0 and Dapps is the next future of development.\n\nhttps://www.freepik.com/free-vector/background-of-people-in-isometric-perspective_1201321.htm and the rest of freepik community including me :-).\n\nAshish Bairwa is an exceptional blockchain enthusiast and can be reached on his linkedin.\n\nDr. Sukant Khurana runs an academic research lab and several tech companies.

        "title": "Blockchain and Deep Learning: A duo to Enhance Healthcare System?",
        "text": "Ever wondered what happens when you combine Blockchain and Deep Learning?\n\nDespite significant advancement in technology in different fields, health management and administrative systems leave a lot of room for improvement. At present, in most of the healthcare organization, the health record of a patient is stored manually which makes it harder to maintain such huge amount of data.\n\nWhy is it so hard to maintain this healthcare data accurately? First of all, these information changes all the time, doctors are constantly moving in and out of networks, they are constantly accepting new insurance coverage, they\u2019re changing office locations and changing their affiliations with clinics and hospitals and the patient is diagnosed at various health organizations. So the information changes a lot. So unless that doctor is very good about contacting their networks every time one of those data fields changes which are going to fall out of sync very quickly. This process, of updating records manually, is not feasible as the records can be updated at each doctor\u2019s as well as patient\u2019s end. And this process results in violating patient\u2019s privacy.\n\nNow how can blockchain solve this ecosystem?\n\nBlockchain Technology basically a transactional ledger, which records transactions shared by multiple parties. Blockchain promises to provide safe and interoperable sharing of real-time data between vendors, payers, and patients in the healthcare industry. The use of blockchain in healthcare is anticipated to reinvent the ecosystem in limitless methods to benefit the affected person and developments in redress results safety and costs. In impact, blockchain technological know-how has the plausible to seriously change healthcare shipping, placing the patient at the center of the healthcare ecosystems and the functionality to expand the security, privacy, and seamless interchange of healthcare data.\n\nBlockchain offers synchronization which used to be the primary flaw in manual updating processes. Every time any modifications or update is made, it is created in shape of a block and once it gets consensus from the network, it will automatically update all the participants involved in the network.\n\nNow how this all is achieved? The blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively besides the altercation of all subsequent blocks. The Blockchain technology acts as a crucial way to streamline the sharing of medical documents in an invulnerable way to guard sufferers non-public records or privacy from hackers, insiders, and outsiders, and give patients more control over their information.\n\nBlockchain in Healthcare reduces cost by eliminating manual processes like multiple isolated ledgers, administrative processes and it provides increased speed of transactions and settlement through immediate distribution with increased security.\n\nBlockchain in Healthcare reduces fraud by means of sharing a common, unchangeable ledge throughout the network, and reduces the risk of single points of failure and attack through distributed network nodes.\n\nThe shift closer to electronic fitness information (EHR) has executed little to enhance the splintered nature of healthcare. Starting from birth, patients accumulate data from clinical encounters, wearable devices, etc\u2026and each data upload adds a new block to their electronic health record. Records of the sorts of data collected (vaccination histories, pathology reports etc) are stored on the parent\u2019s EHR. Each patient owns his or her own electronic health record and decides who can access their data.\n\nSimilarly, each institution can identify electronic health data and decide how to use institutional data. Data collected via non-public fitness and wellness, diagnostics, therapeutics, processes, smart gadgets, genetic testing, and other sources could all be securely integrated into a patient\u2019s unique EHR, accessible to both patients and healthcare institutions. The EHR could be patient-controlled data and institutional-level data, every encrypted access keys for chosen sharing and get entry to levels. Every interaction is time-stamped and imutably added to the chain, adding to its intrinsic security.\n\nThe current existing patient billing management system is mainly manipulated by service providers \u2014 a high fraction of healthcare costs are resulting from immoderate billing or billing for non-carried out services. Blockchain systems would help eliminate the need for intermediaries \u2014 through automation of the majority of the declared arbitration and fee processing work. It can even reduce the time taken for a claim to be accepted from days to minutes, thereby making the process convenient.\n\nAnother complexity that the existing healthcare system is facing is of drug supply. According to Forbes, \u201cBlockchain-based supply chain systems could ensure a chain-of-custody log, with the ability to track each step of the supply chain at the individual drug/product level.\u201d\n\nMoreover, extra add-on functionalities such as non-public keys and smart contracts ought to assist to construct the proof of ownership between exclusive parties.\n\n\u201cIn the recent articles covering efforts in the investigation of the world counterfeit drug menace \u2014 it led to the seizure of counterfeit drugs valued at $74 million (Aboody & Lev, 2000), and on a large scale, an estimated annual loss of $200 million for pharmaceutical companies due to counterfeit drugs (Danzon, 1998).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization (WHO, 2010) estimates worldwide sales of counterfeit medicines to $75 billion in 2010, a 90% rise in five years\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to Statista (2016), the size of the blockchain technology market worldwide from 2017 to 2021 will be expected to grow to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars by 2021 from 339.5 million U.S. dollars in 2017. These estimated forecasts are based on an annual constant growth rate of 61.5%.\u201d\n\nHow could Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence help in Healthcare?\n\nFaster medical treatment saves lives. Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help in saving lives by scouring a multitude of patient\u2019s data and evaluating them to one patient\u2019s health records to detect signs and symptoms 10 to 12 hours earlier than a doctor ought to. In many pressing medical problems, the answer to knowing whom to treat, when to treat, and to treat with, might already be in patient\u2019s data. Machine learning applied to electronic health records (EHRs) can generate actionable insights, from enhancing patient hazard score structure to predicting the onset of disease, to aerodynamic hospital operations.\n\n\u201cBrain Informatics using deep learning makes use of mental health condition of soldiers to analyze the changes in the brain activities during the rise and fall of workload on a soldier and then the usage of cognitive strategies expand the performance of the soldiers.\u201d\n\nElectronic health records (EHRs) hold the clinical background of patients and could be analyzed to perceive the person chance of developing cardiovascular diseases. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly suitable for sequence evaluation, are one of the most promising tools for text or time-series analysis. And one of the most effective applications of RNNs in healthcare is digital scientific report analysis. Recently, RNNs had been used to predict heart failure of sufferers based on clinical activities in their records.\n\nMachine Learning or AI can be used to analyze data, and loop it back in real time to physicians to support them in making the proper decision in medical. The patient\u2019s treatment data which includes symptoms, disease, medicines provided can be stored and further analyzed and used to train machine so that next time a physician sees a patient and enters symptoms, data, and test results, there\u2019s machine learning behind the scenes looking at everything about the patient, and prompting the medical doctor with beneficial information for making a prognosis ordering a test, or suggesting a preventive screening.\n\nSo what happens when you combine Blockchain and Machine Learning?\n\nThe blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer ledger that records and shares transactions, providing security and interoperability for healthcare carriers and their patients. The massive amount of data like each patient visit, diagnosis, prescribed treatment, outcome and other key data are stored in EHRs. To handle this massive data some data manipulation technique is required, nowhere the AI or Machine Learning comes into the picture. AI can be used to analyze and manipulate this data and train himself, learn from the patterns in the data.\n\nWhen Machine Learning and Blockchain converge, the patients can be benefitted from AI\u2019s ability to accelerate the analysis of the enormous amount of data. By using ML and AI to govern the chain, there\u2019s also an opportunity to significantly enhance security.\n\n\u201cProject Shivom works as an ecosystem that provides an open web-marketplace for other companies to add their apps and services, alongside genomic data analytics and personalized medicine. All this is based on the Blockchain-enabled platform\u201d\n\nApps built on a blockchain can make data organized, secured and easily accessible, while artificial intelligence makes it viable to draw out intelligent and valuable insights from giant amounts of data that no human could ever analyze.\n\nBlockchain and AI \u2014 these two technologies go really well together but no one\u2019s really put them together yet. So both technically speaking and morally speaking creating what is called decentralized applications is a really good idea and it\u2019s what we call as developers web 3.0, if you\u2019re looking for something to disrupt you take blockchain take AI you combine it together and you create apps that have never before been possible.\n\n2.

        "text": "Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a very different world from Earth, but it is our closest celestial body with the greatest potential for colonization. At a mass only a little more than 10% of Earth\u2019s, and gravity only a bit more than 1/3rd of our own, Mars is comparatively tiny, dry and extremely cold, with the barest hint of an atmosphere composed almost entirely of CO2.\n\nBut it\u2019s close, very close in astronomical terms. Because both Earth and Mars have elliptical orbits and both travel around the Sun at different speeds, the distance between our planets ranges from 140 million miles on average to ~35 million at their nearest. And Mars has water, in the form of ice, and possibly even some liquid salt water.\n\nThe human race, despite the seemingly secure feeling most of us have living on our large and relatively geologically-stable world, is actually under constant threat from catastrophes that could send our civilizations back to stone-age levels or exterminate us entirely. Comets, meteors, solar flares, supernovae, supervolcanoes, pandemics, nuclear war, and gamma ray bursts are only some of the possible events that could put humanity on the edge of extinction. The odds of any one of these occurring may be low (some astronomically so), but when taken together it is only a matter of decades before we might expect something truly apocalyptic to happen.\n\nPeople who realize this and want to try and preserve our species know there is really only one way: Move a lot of us off-world.\n\nNASA, the United Arab Emirates and mars One are three of the most public contenders for getting to Mars, but there is one organization that seems to be considerably in the lead: SpaceX.\n\nIn 2016, Elon Musk showed the world its first glimpse of his planned Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), a combination of the powerful reusable BFR rocket system (with greater cargo capacity than even the massive Saturn V) and a spaceship that can carry up to 100 people. His goal, via the resources of SpaceX, is to get 1 million people settled on Mars within the next 50 to 100 years.\n\nIn 2022, the first cargo missions will arrive on Mars. These will serve to confirm water resources and potential environmental problems, as well as to import life support, power and mining infrastructure. All of this will be done with robots and drones.\n\nIn 2024, both cargo & crew missions will be run, putting the first humans on Mars, building up the base, and installing propellant manufacturing capability. This will involve extracting frozen water and various dry ices, presumably abundant, from the soil of Mars, in order to make methalox fuel \u2014 liquid O2 + methane.\n\nGetting 1 million people to Mars using the planned ITS system, at 100 settlers per trip, will require 10,000 separate journeys to the Red Planet. Each journey will take roughly 300 days. The plan for the Interplanetary Spaceship is to make the voyage as comfortable as possible, and includes a movie theater, lecture hall and restaurant-style galley. Musk wants it to feel more like an ocean cruise or first-class intercontinental flight than the traditional \u201ccamping in space\u201d vibe that modern astronauts enjoy.\n\nAfter the first few crewed missions, the fledgling Mars colony is expected to look something like this:\n\nBut once we are there, how will we adapt to living in a place so distant? When the average delay of radio communications between \u201chome base\u201d on Earth and Mars clocks in at about 14 minutes, who will make the immediate decisions needed in crisis situations?\n\nMoving a sizable portion of the human population to a completely new, large territory with a large amount of natural resources presents many opportunities. It is comparable in some ways to the European settlement of the Americas, only thankfully there are no native inhabitants of Mars that would be endangered by such colonization. But European colonization, involving multiple powerful countries, resulted in centuries of warfare before any long term stability was reached. Before we begin colonizing Mars as a species, we would be best served to set down a set of laws and treaties to try and prevent such conflict.\n\nAs a start, it\u2019s useful to look to the recent past on Earth for some examples of this:\n\nThe U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty governs ocean resources and assumes that governments, not individuals, have rights to those resources.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty has as its main goal the prevention of economic or military involvement on the continent, thus keeping Antarctica as a land shared for the purpose of research.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967, modeled somewhat after the Antarctic Treaty, also precludes government ownership of celestial bodies. It stipulates:\n\nIn effect, the Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, Titan, Europa, and any other place we may one day choose, or need, to exploit is supposed to be considered property of ALL Earth governments, and to be used for the betterment of all peoples. But this model is utopian at best, and unrealistic in any regard. While treaties do help maintain some semblance of order, they only do so as long as the potential rewards for a given party to such a treaty do not outweigh the risks of breaking such a promise. Would any treaty have prevented the European exploration and eventual claim and settlement of the Americas, and the exploitation and wars that followed?\n\nWhatever is agreed to by private organizations and governments must be agreed to with the foreknowledge that any utopian, ultra-socialistic agreements cannot hold in the long term. The probable best way to set up a Martian society would be to ensure that it is unencumbered by the ancient geopolitical strife of Earth. In essence, Mars should be viewed as a free New World of its own, and and settlers encouraged to develop it, extract resources, produce new products, and launch business ventures in any and every way, with one caveat: Martian civilization must be designed from the ground up to be self-sustaining and long lasting, with an open immigration policy and a limiting cap placed on population decided on in advance.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Mars colonization visionaries is a planet that is terraformed, green and wet \u2014 what we could truly call a sister world of Earth. But terraforming will be extremely costly. To afford it, Mars will need to become \u201cprofitable\u201d first. This is why economic growth will have to be unfettered on the planet for a time. Extreme socialistic restrictions would only hinder that growth.\n\nElon Musk, SpaceX founder, does not believe mining or creation of products on Mars, and then transporting those materials back to Earth, will be economically viable, since the cost of transport alone, in energy and time, would far exceed the value of what might be transported. He thinks the real economic value of a Mars colony to Earth will be in the intellectual property that results from the vast amount of innovation that will result from humanity\u2019s quest to conquer the new frontier itself. Challenge and necessity brought on by human expansion on Earth has spurred invention for hundreds of thousands of years, and that will continue as we move on into space.\n\nMars, ultimately, represents a second chance in a couple ways. If humanity\u2019s existence on Earth is threatened, we will have another world to call home. And, in another sense, if Mars can grow as a new, independent entity, it might be our chance to build a truly peaceful, united world, free of the ancient animosities and strife that plague us here on Earth.\n\nAnd if all goes well, with some apologies to Neil Armstrong, Mars will be remembered thousands of years from now as the first true step Homo Sapiens took into the cosmos.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing!

        "text": "Two years ago, I was working for Mindvalley, an online publishing company located in Malaysia.\n\nThe reason I was there was to learn how an online education company works, because up until that point I was an offline educator \u2014 spending my time delivering workshops and trainings, organizing seminars and conferences all over the Europe.\n\nMy goal was to quit that job and turn my blog Zero to Skill into an actual company.\n\nI didn\u2019t have the money to invest in advertising my content, and I knew that simply writing articles and hoping people will read them, wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nJust a couple of months later, I met Raghav Haran, who went on to become my friend, and now a business partner. He told me that he wrote two articles on Medium and each generated over 6,000 subscribers.\n\nFrom that point on, I started paying more attention to virality. Or to be more specific:\n\nWith each article, I would try something new. If it worked, I would add it to my next one.\n\nAs more time passed by, I learned a lot, and at the same time I grew more anxious to quit my job \u2014 I simply didn\u2019t feel that I belong there.\n\nSo, I took 3 weeks off, closed myself in my room, and decided to take it to the next level.\n\nAbout 10 days in, I wrote 13 Things You Should Give Up If You Want To Be Successful \u2014 which ended up becoming #1 viral article in the history of Medium.\n\nWhich is in my opinion a great accomplishment, having in mind that I\u2019m not a native speaker, and that my mom used to write my essays in high school.\n\nBy following the process of trying something new, and applying what I\u2019ve learned to my new pieces, I was able to generate over 50 million readers over the last two years \u2014 something that I never thought was possible.\n\nAnd today, I decided to compile the list of 10 things I believe play a huge role when it comes to creating articles, that people will find valuable and useful enough to share it with their network, and thus far increasing the chance of it going viral."

There are many messenger apps on the market, for instance, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. You can use chatbots to help you out or if you want to provide a more personalised experience, you can choose to interact with your leads or existing customers directly via a messenger app. For example, WhatsApp offers WhatsApp Business App that serves this purpose.\n\nEmail Marketing always finds its place in every marketing plan \u2014 it is affordable, personalised and easy to implement. However, there are some challenges. Many email servers have a spam filter in place, your promotional emails might be filtered out before reaching the receivers. Even if you\u2019re lucky and your emails pass through the spam filter, if your email content is not relevant or engaging, the receivers will not hesitate to hit to unsubscribe button.\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by Constant Contact, an email marketing platform, the average email open rate is 17.62% and the average click-through rate is 7.97%. At this point, you may be curious about the figure of Messenger Marketing.\n\nBefore I reveal the Messenger Marketing figure, I want to share some findings from Facebook Data and WhatsApp:\n\nThe \u201cwow\u201d does not stop here.\n\nHere are some figures from Kissmetrics:\n\n80% open rates for broadcast messages \n\n30\u201340% click-through rates (4\u201310x email marketing averages)\n\n5x the volume of content downloads and event registrations\n\nEverything looks so promising so far.\n\nThere are many things you can try out. For instance, distribute your content, seasonal sale alerts, new product release, ask for a review, offer a discount \u2014 Sky is the limit.\n\nNow you may have a question, how much does Messenger Marketing cost if I want to build a chatbot? The companies below all offer a free plan and coding knowledge is not required for building a chatbot.\n\nManyChat: Engage up to 25K subscribers \u2014 USD 145 per month.\n\nMobileMonkey: Their paid plan starts from USD 42 per month.\n\nChatfuel: Their Pro plan starts from USD 30 per bot per page.\n\nThe above information is just for your reference, how much it costs depends on various factors \u2014 the number of contacts you have, if you need any additional features and so on.\n\nNow you may want to just get started right away but hold your horses! As you know, nothing is perfect.\n\nThe very first thing you may want to think about is that, if you use messenger as the major channel to communicate with your potential and existing customers, the messenger that you use owns the mean of communication. What I mean is that unlike the traditional channels, like telephone calls and emails, you are bounded to use that particular messenger service. If you do not like your email service provider, you are free to switch to a better one, but this is not the case with messenger service.\n\nThe other drawback is that your potential customers may not want to reach out to your business via a messenger app like Facebook since a Facebook profile contains too much personal information, like DOB, hobbies, favourite movies, and so on. This sort of information can help you profile or segment your leads but there is a privacy issue you need to consider.\n\nBefore you start using messenger for marketing, you also need to make sure that you have enough manpower to handle the increased workload. Chatbot can no doubt answer some of the basic questions that your potential customers may have but for more complicated cases, you definitely need a human to take over. Otherwise, your chatbot may become an obstacle in your sales funnel.\n\nUndeniably, Being an early adapter in Messenger Marketing or any marketing channel could give you an edge over your competitors. However, just like other channels, there are pros and cons. As a startup, it is particularly important to have a thorough consideration before allocating your budget in this relatively new marketing trend. If you are using messenger apps in your marketing \u2014 I would love to hear your experience and advice!"

But they might have potential corruption. Once it happens, you might lose all your files.\n\nThey are cross-platform. They can be transferred from Linux, to Windows, to PCs, wherever. You can also put them up on cloud system.\n\nThey are format agnostic. No matter ppt, keynote, PDF and etc, you can all store them in folders.\n\nSince you want to access your files at everywhere even with others devices, so that you don\u2019t need to waste time on the things that we described before. i like to use Dropbox for 100 percent availability.\n\nI can retrieve and access the contents of my trusted system on any device that supports Dropbox as long as I have my Dropbox password.\n\nRemember, you must be able to access and edit your trusted system wherever you are.
