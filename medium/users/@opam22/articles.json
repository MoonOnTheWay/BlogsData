Why? because people love story.\n\nSebelum melakukan instalasi, please make sure that your os or architectures sensuai dengan yg ada diatas. Pertanyaannya adalah, kalau tidak ada yg sesuai bagaimana? tenang, kita mungkin masih bisa menginstal dari source atau menggunakan gccgo.

I often thinking what if I can make #the100dayproject like she and others do, but I don\u2019t know what kind of project I should make.\n\nGolang or Go is open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. The language was announced in November 2009, it is used in some of Google\u2019s production system, as well as by other firms.\n\nGolang seems to be promising to learn, so what if I make my own 100 Day Project about Golang? Why not.\n\nJust like Jean Hsu, I\u2019m going to put this line.\n\n\u201c Don\u2019t judge me too much if I don\u2019t keep up or drop out.\u201d."

Itsn\u2019t work vs life, it\u2019s all about hobby vs life.\n\nI love to build something, I love typing code, I love deleting code, I love copying and pasting code, I love searching answer on Stackoverflow, I love something that makes me think.\n\nSometimes my hobby makes me overwhelmed.\n\nSometimes my hobby makes me f*cked up.\n\nBut more often,\n\nIt makes me happy.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I wasn\u2019t lucky like any other kids out there who have personal computer from their parents. I had to go to Cyber Cafe and pay Rp. 3000/hour for rent a computer and internet. I started playing computer since I was 6th grade of elementary school. Going back to that time, all I did on computer is playing a game named Tantra, I got crazy of this game.\n\nAfter Tantra, I play Rising Force(RF), Ayo Dance, Counter Strike, Point Blank and other games. In Junior High School, my parents give me Rp. 5000/day and I spend my Rp. 4000 for Cyber cafe and Rp. 1000 for a drink, shit I\u2019m so stupid at this time. After I realize that I just spend too much money, I stop playing online games, I stop when I was at my 2nd grade of Junior High School.\n\nMy first phone was Nokia E63 and I think I\u2019m lucky to have this phone as my first phone, because this phone is Symbian based and there are many communities out there who love to hacking this OS. I joined a grup in Facebook (Nokia E63 Community) and there are many people talk about hacking this OS in that group \u2014 if you hack the OS, you have a full responsibility on your phone, you can change everything, you can make your Nokia phone looks like Blackberry (of course without BBM) or Android. even, I can play Harvest Moon in my phone :).\n\nI installed an application named Light Notepad on my phone and started to learn HTML and CSS at High School. Yes I started coding from phone, not computer.\n\nI entered college and still doesn\u2019t have personal computer/laptop, my first laptop is TOSHIBA with 2.2 GHz intel dual core processor and 2 gb of ram and I got it when I was at my 2nd semester. I learn C++ in my early days of college. I got lucky I had smart lecturer, her name is Indah Dwijayanti (I would be happy if she reads this story), she was my lecturer of my Algorithm & Programming class. Maybe if I got another lecturer, I wouldn\u2019t understand how to write C++ code. That was the first time I learn about programming (yes I started coding from High School, but it only HTML and CSS and they both are not programming languages, they are just Mark-up languages) and I enjoyed it.\n\nIt was love at first sight.\n\nSo if you ask me how I can spend my time everyday sit there in front of my laptop, a simple answer is, I am happy with what I do."

Instead, it will do asynchronous request (AJAX) and will receive JSON.\n\nDid you already got the point bro?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, let\u2019s do some practical explanation.\n\nWrite an HTML file like this (you can just copy-paste this html and run on your computer):\n\nIf we run this HTML, and click the Go to bookmark link, it will going like this\n\nEverytime we click the Go to bookmark link, look at our URL, it makes hash #/bookmark, and it will jump us to the HTML section with ID /bookmark. If you know HTML so well, you won\u2019t be suprised.\n\nThere\u2019s something interisting we can do with this in JavaScript, let\u2019s edit our HTML\n\nAnd let\u2019s make JavaScript file named app.js, and start listening for an event, remember the event loop in JavaScript, right?\n\nSo this code means, if there\u2019s some \u2018hashchange\u2019 event, do something, in this code, we will make log with the value of our curent hash (window.location.hash). Let\u2019s run our HTML + JS\n\nAnd there\u2019s something more interisting we can do, let\u2019s edit our JS\n\nSo, this time we do flow control programming (if condition), what we do are, we do check if current hash is #/bookmark, we will make a log, this is just a log, in real application we can do some asynchronous request or something.\n\nLet\u2019s make some fun, edit our HTML and JS\n\nEverytime we click the link, whether go to bookmark or go to about or etc, our JavaScript will be execute, because we add hashchange event listener, and our JavaScript will do flow control programming, check, if current hash is equal to something, then do something (in this case we make a log).\n\nLook at our URL, everytime we change our hash, our index.html doesn\u2019t change, and that\u2019s single page application, we just load our HTML once, after that our application (client side) can make asynchronous request (AJAX) to server and will receive response JSON.\n\nIf there\u2019s something wrong about my explanation, just let me know.\n\nThis post was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvHecQOiu8g\n\nThis is an example how we make SPA with Angular.js https://github.com/opam22/angular_best_practice"

On January \u2014 February \u2014 March, I felt like shit, I was fucked up lv. 100.\n\nI have a financial problem, I have to stop my study in college for 1 semester because I have no money to pay my college administration. In the end of 2014, I\u2019ve break up with my girlfriend, I\u2019ve been dissapointed by the one that I think will not dissapoint me. My parents have a a big fight around February. Even my laptop (the tool I used to learn programming) was broken, its LCD was broken and I have no money too fix it.\n\nAs you read above, in the begining of 2015, My head and my heart was broken at the same time. In that moment there\u2019s only one thing on my head \u2018Oh shit, this is the zero point of my life, I have to do something to fix all of this, I believe I can fix this\u2019.\n\nOn 1st of April, I start to work as a Junior Web Developer in company named PT. Misete Solusi Teknologi, I\u2019ve one project in that company. Since I have work, My financial situation was improved, I already no longer depend on my parents for money. My life was getting better and better, I met new people and new friends.\n\nI worked for Misete for just 3 months and then I move into Start-up company named PT. Tulpar Asia Digital, we have 2 projects, the first one is http://e-tender.asia and the second one is http://kece.id by the way I still working in Tulpar until now.\n\nToday, on 1st of January 2016. I realize 2015 was an amazing year, I learn a lot of things, here\u2019s a few things I learned in 2015:\n\nYup, the dark moments can turn you into shiny diamond.\n\nYup, whatever that happen in your life right now, just LET IT BE, everything\u2019s gonna be okay, no matter what.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much I play The Beatles\u2019 Let It Be song in 2015 :)\n\nYup, nothing lasts forever, even the pain that caused by \u2018nothing lasts forever\u2019 is also do not last forever.\n\nI know, I\u2019m still 20, and in the near future I will have much dark moments like I have in 2015.\n\nBut, I believe no matter what the fuck things that will happen in my life, I\u2019m still damn FINE."

Instead, we will make our own controller to handle authentication :)\n\nSome things we need\n\nSee? The activation_code and active column I add above?\n\nKolom itu nanti yang akan kita gunakan untuk\n\nactivation_code = digunakan untuk menyimpan & mencocokan kode aktivasi\n\nactive = apabila user telah melakukan aktivasi, maka kita akan mengupdate kolom ini.\n\nDisana juga saya menggunakan form builder laravel. So it\u2019s up to you, If u want to use form builder, or u can use form as usual.. your code, your choice :p\n\nThis is the main part right? haaaaaaa :)\n\nOkay kita sudah buat form untuk registrasi nya dan kalau kita perhatikan kita juga sudah mengarahkan actionnya dengan method route ke route yang bernama post-registration, tapi kita belum membuat route ini, so let\u2019s do that baby\n\nKita sudah berhasil membuat aplikasi kita bisa dipakai untuk registrasi, dan lalu mengaktivasi nya lewat email, so mari kita selesaikan ini dengan menambahkan yang terakhir, yaitu, Log in and Log out.\n\nMasih banyak sebetulnya yang perlu dilakukan, mulai dari memunculkan message hingga me redirect ke view ketika berhasil log in, aktifasi, error ketika mencoba log in padahal akun belum terverifikasi dsb, di tutorial ini saya cuman menampilkan return saja ketika hal itu dilakukan, tidak me redirectnya ke view, hal itu bisa kalian lakukan sendiri hehe, nanti malah kepanjangan tutorialnya\u2026\n\nKalian juga perlu memanfaatkan middleware\u2026\n\nKarna sejujurnya tutorial ini dibuat lebih fokus ke Email Verification-nya."
