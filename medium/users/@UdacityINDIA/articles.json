        "title": "Tensorflow or PyTorch : The Force is Strong with which One?",
        "text": "So, since you\u2019re reading this article, I\u2019m going to assume you have started your deep learning journey and have been playing around for a while with artificial neural nets. Or maybe, you\u2019re just thinking of starting. Whichever case it be, you find yourself in a bit of a dilemma. You have read about various deep learning frameworks and libraries and maybe two really stand out. The two most popular deep learning libraries: Tensorflow and PyTorch. And you can\u2019t quite figure out what exactly is the difference. Fret not! I\u2019m here to add one more article to the unending repository of the Internet. And maybe, help you get some clarity. Also, I\u2019m going to make it easier and quicker for you, and give you just five points. Five points of comparison, no more. So, let\u2019s begin!\n\nWhile both Tensorflow and PyTorch are open-source, they have been created by two different wizards. Tensorflow is based on Theano and has been developed by Google, whereas PyTorch is based on Torch and has been developed by Facebook.\n\nThe most important difference between the two is the way these frameworks define the computational graphs. While Tensorflow creates a static graph, PyTorch believes in a dynamic graph. So what does this mean? In Tensorflow, you first have to define the entire computation graph of the model and then run your ML model. But in PyTorch, you can define/manipulate your graph on-the-go. This is particularly helpful while using variable length inputs in RNNs.\n\nTensorflow has a more steep learning curve than PyTorch. PyTorch is more pythonic and building ML models feels more intuitive. On the other hand, for using Tensorflow, you will have to learn a bit more about it\u2019s working (sessions, placeholders etc.) and so it becomes a bit more difficult to learn Tensorflow than PyTorch.\n\nTensorflow has a much bigger community behind it than PyTorch. This means that it becomes easier to find resources to learn Tensorflow and also, to find solutions to your problems. Also, many tutorials and MOOCs cover Tensorflow instead of using PyTorch. This is because PyTorch is a relatively new framework as compared to Tensorflow. So, in terms of resources, you will find much more content about Tensorflow than PyTorch.\n\nThis comparison would be incomplete without mentioning TensorBoard. TensorBoard is a brilliant tool that enables visualizing your ML models directly in your browser. PyTorch doesn\u2019t have such a tool, although you can always use tools like Matplotlib. Although, there are integrations out there that let you use Tensorboard with PyTorch. But it\u2019s not supported natively.\n\nFinally, Tensorflow is much better for production models and scalability. It was built to be production ready. Whereas, PyTorch is easier to learn and lighter to work with, and hence, is relatively better for passion projects and building rapid prototypes.\n\nAlright enough! Just tell me which one is better?\n\nThere is no right answer.(I know, I hate it too when someone says that)\n\nThe truth is, some people find it better to use PyTorch while others find it better to use Tensorflow. Both are great frameworks with a huge community behind them and lots of support. They both get the job done. They both are amazing magical wands that will let you do some machine learning magic.\n\nI hope I was able to help you in clearing your confusion(little bit, maybe?). And if you are really confused and haven\u2019t used any of them yet, pick any and just start. You will develop more intuition which will help you decide.\n\nIf you are just beginning your deep learning journey, and want to learn how to build deep learning models(like CNNs, RNNs or GANs) in Tensorflow and Keras, try out this Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity.\n\nAnd finally, these are just tools. You can pick any and start learning the science and art of machine learning."

        "title": "Everything cool from Tensorflow Developer Summit 2018",
        "text": "Firstly an important feature introduced by Google is Colaboratory Notebooks. It will enable you to run the codes of Tensorflow on GPU without any installation overhead. Here is a great tool for those who can\u2019t afford to have GPU at all times. All the jupyter notebooks will be shared in your google drive.\n\nIf you are into Machine Learning field, you will know about Tensorflow and Keras. This year Tensorflow Developers are now gifted with new updates. Some of them which according to a Machine learning engineer/researcher are needed are listed down below -\n\nLet\u2019s say you are writing a program. For each line the compiler evaluates your code as soon as it is written. This evaluation strategy is known as Eager execution. It will surely affect your prototyping speed, because now there is a transparency in execution. This is not new as compared to implementation in PyTorch. But now developers can do the same thing in tensorflow. So when we enable the eager execution in tensorflow, there is no need of running the Session.run() for executing the operations.\n\nPlease watch below video to completely understand about this new functionality.\n\nOne great thing about it, which I personally want to emphasize on this slide from the video.\n\nEnabling eager execution will make your debugging more faster. Old codes of tensorflow models can also be debugged well by running eager execution with graph based code. Starting with learning the functionality of eager execution will be good starting point if you are new to tensorflow.\n\nJump straight into the tutorial with this Google colab.\n\nMore information covered in below link:\n\nOne biggest development thread on Tensorflow was Tensorflow Mobile. The idea is to port the deep models on embedded platforms so that the inference part of the task can run. It will directly help in making and prototyping a product which can be deployed. In the developer summit, Tflite was updated with new features and more code base. There are not all the operations present in Tflite but they recommend to post the issue on github, which will make the library more robust and reliable.\n\nI recommend running the demo android application by Tensorflow. [Demo Application in Android]\n\nThis is an early stage open source project by Google, where the main goal is to redefine whole codebase of Tensorflow in Swift. The sole reason behind this new change is that Machine learning as a whole can be implemented in a new language.\n\nThis implementation will be really cool to watch when the codebase releases. All the interability and usability of Swift will be directly inside Tensorflow.\n\nSubscribe here for more updates:\n\nFull video of the talk here:\n\nI was dazzled to see the tensorflow playground in my laptop\u2019s web browser. Watching the input nodes supplying the data with interactive hidden layers to match the output function was mesmerizing. Checkout this cool project \u2014\n\nThe reason why the above project was a hit because without any installation a person can run and understand the behaviour of deep network through its browser. It motivated the developers at Google to develop a web based library for machine learning.\n\nCheck out the tensorflow library in Javascript which is WebGL accelerated for training and deploying deep learning models.\n\nA good utility for all the web developers out there to understand and make new applications based on Machine learning. Check some of cool demos.\n\nA major concern for a Deep Learning engineer is to generate the results as fast as possible so that a deployable solution can be made in business. The only way is to use the cpu and gpu of the machine to its fullest. This is what tf.data input pipeline does in every ETL(Extraction, Transform, Loading) process of data.\n\nThe next release of Tensorflow 1.7 will enable the functionality of input pipelines in Tensorflow. The user can directly import the dataset in tensorflow which will handle the iterator on data so that the throughput of the system is more. We can wrap the dataset inside a input function and then it can be handled directly to the model.\n\nWhen Tensorflow meets Software engineering, Tensorflow Hub is born. Now suppose you want to use some pre-trained models for your own training/task. What an ML engineer does is that he/she downloads the weights of that model, prepare same format of data for the model, set the hyperparameters and then train. But with this Tensorflow Hub release, this pipeline is shortened by providing a fully functional module of the task.\n\nThe module contains the Tensorflow graphs which can be directly imported and reused for your own task. Even they can be altered very effectively and in very less time, which in turn increases the throughput of the work.\n\nIt directly serves to the purpose of reusability and modularity in Machine Learning, which is very helpful for business needs.\n\nMore information using an example:\n\nI haven\u2019t covered each and every functionality but those which are game changer for Tensorflow developers. I hope to see more great changes and improvements in Tensorflow. Below are some of the resources that might help you:"

        "text": "Today, in the midst of the 4th industrial revolution, we only hear about AI, robot automation, big data, and the list goes on. As we are approaching 2020, we are allowed to be a bundle of nerves when thinking about their implications in the workforce. But let\u2019s put our fears aside for a minute and weigh the advantages that robotics will or have already begun to bring.\n\nRegardless of the growing conceptions (or misconceptions) on this so-called robotics era, innovative technologies will create more wealth and, in the long run, better jobs.\n\nSimply put, robots will make our lives so much easier by eliminating unpleasant, repetitive tasks that overall productivity will increase. In fact, based on a 2015 survey by AI language company Narrative Science, 80% of executives believe that AI will boost performance and productivity.\n\nWhat happens when productivity levels go up? \u201cCompanies have more sales, workers have more money, people feel more optimistic\u201d says Robert Atkinson, economist of the Think Tank Information Technology & Innovation Foundation.\n\nTypically, innovation drives economic growth \u2014 we are all (or should be) conscious about it. Economists have calculated that approximately 50% of the U.S annual GDP growth is attributed to increases in innovation.\n\nAdditionally, innovation makes both good economic and good business sense \u2014 at least for today\u2019s businesses that are submerged by globalisation and digitalisation.\n\nII. Jobs will be taken by robots \u2014 but better ones will emerge\n\nThe march of the machine has been feared for centuries. But bear in mind that machines have only changed work \u2014 they have not replaced it. It has been the case since the 1st industrial revolution!\n\nHumans, along with machines, will play a critical role in manufacturing\u2019s success. In this 4th industrial revolution, we have always spoken about the combination of both humans and robots. In other words, manufacturers will have a combination of both talents \u2014 not one over the other.\n\nEvidently, it\u2019s not the case for each and every industry. Some job functions will be 100% replaced rather than just 50%. For example, jobs that consist of manual tasks. But that could mean more opportunities!\n\nYou may ask yourself. \u201cHow will I know what these opportunities are?\u201d.\n\nFor example, on Jobable Labs, we provide data that illustrates how likely a certain job from a specific industry is to be replaced by a robot. In the case where a job is 90% likely to be replaced, \u201cUpskilling\u201d is recommended. This means gaining new skills to surpass the capabilities of the robot in question. Ultimately, the platform is showing what automation means in terms of opportunities \u2014 not losses.\n\nArtificial intelligence will typically force you to find a creative profession or one that requires a human touch. The new roles that will arise will be more emotionally complex and creative. The future of work is exciting!\n\nTo conclude, no matter what repercussions AI has in social, economic and political aspects, the presence of robotics will boost human productivity and set a new bar for creativity. Undeniably, a lot of jobs will be taken over \u2014 but it will be our responsibility to adapt to this change. As humans, we are used to adapting to change \u2014 it\u2019s nothing new! Let\u2019s start seeing the rise of robots as an enormous advantage for our society \u2014 and perhaps, as a change that will make us more\u2026 human.\n\nMaster skills with hands-on projects in simulated environments and on real hardware.

        "title": "Difference between Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence",
        "text": "Artificial Intelligence is a very broad terms which aims to bring about intelligent behaviour in machines. What should be considered \u2018intelligent\u2019 and what should be the approach to attain have varying philosophies. Machine learning can be considered as one of those philosophies where the main goal is, \u201cinstead of explicitly programming machines, just give them the data and let them learn\u201d. In this approach also there are way too many sub categories: supervised learning (training labelled dataset and creating a model to predict unlabelled dataset), unsupervised learning (drawing meaningful inferences from unlabelled dataset, clustering being the most popular example), reinforcement learning (giving the algorithm and objective function to optimize for based on immediate reward for each action it takes, eg: chess playing robot), etc. As opposed to learning from rules or logical induction which was heavily used in the beginning of Artificial Intelligence research Machine learning considers data as the most important factor. Since machine learning models are based on the data fed by human engineers or by observing the real world (again influenced by the real world) such models are likely to pick up the prejudices, biases and flaws of human reasoning. One of the incidents happened in 2016, where a twitter bot designed by Microsoft soon turned out to be a racist and had to be shut down.\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning aims to bring artificial intelligence through learning from the data. Data is to machine learning as code is to traditional computing. Another way of obtaining intelligence in machines could be through logical programming, inductive reasoning based on fundamental rules and so on. Thus ML can be considered as one of the approaches towards Artificial Intelligence. Based on the nature of various problems that exist and the abundance of data for the problem it\u2019s only reasonable that machine learning has been the go-to approach to attain AI. The fact that the corpus of data is very huge and ever increasing, computing resources (machines as well as humans) are limited and it\u2019s not possible to work through rule based programming has gravitated the overall AI approaches towards ML.\n\nDeep learning on the other hand is a rapidly emerging and flourishing method of machine learning. In a normal machine learning setup one of the most difficult problems is feature engineering. Feature engineering deals with extraction of suitable features that could be fed in to the model. If features are incomplete or less the model is flawed (high bias) and if features are way too many and not all of them contributing to model\u2019s output, the model is again flawed (high variance). If we have too many features we need a very very huge dataset to learn from otherwise the model is flawed. In machine learning there is a subfield called \u2018representational learning\u2019 also known as \u2018feature learning\u2019 which aims to extract features from data like images where hand picking features by human engineers is simply not viable. Deep learning is based on representational learning. Implementation wise it is composed of numerous layers of neural networks (higher the number of layer, deeper the model) where each layer gets input from previous layer and passes it off to the next layer. Starting layers deal with more generic and coarse features and as the network goes deeper it is able to learn finer details from the dataset finally giving the output with a certain confidence factor. Functionality wise, they are inspired by how mammalian neurons work. Neurons work by taking an input chemical signal and based on certain threshold that signal is passed or blocked off. Such behaviours are emulated using various mathematical functions (sigmoid function being the most common) while implementing neural networks. Although Deep learning based models are finding more and more success they are not always the answer. They require so much of training data to perform well.\n\nUpskill yourself in these advanced technologies. Enroll Now"

        "text": "Machine learning where we want to mimic the functioning of the brain to related the data with its features. Idea of deep learning comes from imitating the working of a neuron. Deep learning has only come into the picture 5 years ago, but the seeds of the term has been coined during 1940\u2019s.\n\nIn 1940, Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch developed a technique called as TLU(Threshold Logic Unit) which mimics the activation of the neuron just like in brain cell. Then came the one neuron network by Frank Rosenblatt called perceptron.\n\nFrank quoted \u201cThe perceptron is the embryo of an electronic computer that the Navy expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence. \u201d\n\nBut only G.Hinton became the father of deep learning by introducing a concept/way of learning for these neurons AKA backpropagation. It was a defined and structured way of calculating losses and derivatives inside a layer of neurons which will be automatically generated according to the loss function.\n\nThen we all know about Yann Lecun CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) paper where he introduced LeNet 5 for digit classification in 1990\u2019s. But after this also, there was no concept of deep learning, thanks to less computing power and lack of huge amount of data.\n\nIn 2006, Hinton introduced to deep belief networks, where one can learn the weights of a new layer by keeping the previous layer parameters fixed. Using this idea, people were able to train much larger networks by adding just layers on the top. This strategy of adding the layers coined the term of \u201cDeep\u201d in Deep Learning.\n\nThanks to gamer community when Nvidia released CUDA as a toolkit to program multithreaded graphics, little did they know that the same architecture would help in increase in performance of Deep neural network. With release of Web 2.0 and increased connectivity among the world by internet, the accessibility of data grew.\n\nThere is only one way to ride this wave of deep learning. It is by keeping updated.

        "text": "Brad Pitt starrer Moneyball, is a perfect example of importance of data accumulation and insights generation. The sabermetric approach for analysing baseball players depicted in the movie, enabled the Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) to bet on undervalued players due to limited budget by franchise. Though the movie released in 2011, it is based on the real events which occured in 2002. Since then, data is being used across different domains producing amazing insights and surprising impacts.\n\nWith data generated at every hover and click across web pages, the unprecedented growth of data cannot be ignored. A 5 seconds video generates 125 frames, each being different from other. Each frame in a video and each hover on an image, contains some qualitative and quantitative information about that event, and the process of inspecting and modelling this event, in order to generate decision making insights is data analysis.\n\nData Analytics has helped companies to increase revenues, manage supply vs demand, improve market strategies, analyse customer behaviour, optimise campaigns and identify fraud. Besides these, there are many other applications of data analysis, some of which we will discuss below.\n\nIn FIFA world cup 2014 semi-finals, Germany defeated Brazil with a margin of 7\u20131. Besides the effort of the players, this win was also credited to SAP which developed a tool in association with German Football Association, to find strengths and weaknesses of opposite teams much ahead of the competition.\n\nWith simple statistical based insights of 2010 world cup, SAP found that German players had ball retained at their feet for an average of 4.3 seconds throughout world cup. The SAP advised the players to reduce the amount of time of retaining the ball at their feet, and German Football Association suggested ways for the same, thereby decreasing the time of getting to the opposite goal. The average decreased to 1.1 seconds in 2014.\n\nSAP also developed applications such as SAP Challenger Insights and Penalty Insights Function which helped in analysing oppositions\u2019 offensive and defensive tendencies during penalty kicks.\n\nDating website OKCupid, analysed 275K match questions and 776 million answers, and came out with the following insights:\n\nBF Agritech and CropIn, are two companies which have started analysing real time data and gain insights on crops and farms, so as to be able to corrective measures on time.\n\nThe service offered by BF Agritech, is based on sophisticated algorithms, which sends alerts and notifications to farmer\u2019s mobile phone. The system can detect stress, identify its causes and then alert the farmer, through mobile notifications. This transmission of information in reak tie is important because problems and threats can be detected with the sensors hours or days before they are visible in the field.\n\nCropIn, on the other hand, help producing traceability (where a direct customer can trace back a fruit or vegetable he/she is buying back to the farmer). They also assist farmers in getting farm loans, by providing credible information of the geography and soil quality to help farmers get adequate farm insurance."

        "title": "My Experience of Udacity\u2019s Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree",
        "text": "Around September of the year 2016, Udacity announced a one-of-its-kind program. The program spanned over almost 10 months and promised to teach you the basics of one of the most interesting and exciting technology in the industry. It was designed by some of the pioneers in the field, like Prof. Sebastian Thrun, and was offered online, in the comfort and convenience of your home. The course had also bagged industry partnerships with Nvidia and Mercedes among others. The program was the Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree and it required proficiency in the basics of programming and machine learning to be eligible for enrollment.\n\nWithout wasting a minute, I logged into my Udacity account and registered for the course. I had already completed a lot of online courses on various topics of my interest and the Nanodegree seemed like a great place to not only learn about the amazing technologies behind the autonomous vehicles, but also get an experience with designing my own self driving car. The course promised to give the students an opportunity to run their final project on a real vehicle by implementing various functionalities like Drive-by-Wire, Traffic Light Detection and Classification, Steering, Path Planning, etc. I was selected for the November cohort of the course and I officially received my access on November 29, 2016.\n\nToday, three months after completing my Nanodegree, I look back at the course as one of the best investments of my time and money. The course lectures were very well designed and structured. The three terms of the nano-degree were meticulously planned. The first term introduced the concepts of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The projects involved a lot of scripting with Python and TensorFlow to solve the problems like Lane and Curvature Detection, Vehicle Detection, Steering Angle prediction, etc. The application oriented nature of the projects made it even more interesting.\n\nTerm 2 was focused on the control side of things. It covered the topics of Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control. This term was heavily dominated by C++ and Algebra. The projects included implementing Extended and Unscented Kalman filters for tracking non-linear motion, Localization using Markov and Particle Filter and Model Predictive Control to drive the vehicle around the track. I learnt many new things in this term, from C++ programming to the mathematics behind the working of Kalman Filter, Particle Filter and MPC to their algorithmic implementations.\n\nThe final term was focused on stitching together the various topics that were taught and applying them to create your own autonomous vehicle. The topics included path planning, semantic segmentation (or scene understanding), functional safety and finally the capstone project.\n\nWhat set the entire nano-degree apart from the other courses was its novelty. There is no other course out there that can teach you so much in such a short amount of time and in so much depth. The course also provided me with a collated set of resources for learning. Apart from the well-designed lecture videos, quizzes and projects, one of the most rewarding experiences was interaction with people from around the world. Everyone who was taking the course was excited and eager to share his/her knowledge and help others. The Slack and the Udacity discussion forums are full of activities. I interacted with people from around the world, from USA to Germany, to Japan. I discussed the projects and lectures with people from different academic and professional backgrounds, from a freshman to a Vice President of Engineering. These interactions not only helped me to create a world-wide network but also opened my eyes to the opportunities that are present around me. I also got an opportunity to explore some of the open courses like Stanford\u2019s CS231n, the materials for which are freely available online. The amazing support of my peers and mentors played a huge role in helping me to master the material.\n\nThe nano-degree took a lot of time and effort to complete. Since I also pursued the optional material, which were mostly research papers, it took me more than average time for completion. However, the effect of the course was so profound, that I still go back to the material for revision, interact with new students on Slack and discuss the projects over WhatsApp. The course changed the way I approach the problems and provided me with a solid base for future research. I hope that Udacity launches a more advanced version of the course soon."

        "text": "There has been a lot of fuss in the air about deep learning,deep brain,deep mind,deep that deep this.The usage of the word deep has increased exponentially and deep learning is the first result when google search pops up its suggestions in its search bar.You probably have landed here because you already know what deep learning is all about and since deep learning is so deep we don\u2019t want to deep dive in the code and get lost,thus deep learning frameworks comes really as a savior.When deciding which framework to use for your applications you should always follow \u201cno free lunch theorem\u201d and know that every framework has its own pros and cons.\n\nAt the end of the discussion just for fun I have incorporated multiple sources of comparison articles and benchmark results between different frameworks on the basis of running speed,ease of code,number of forks/starts on github etc.\n\nLet us dive into these deep frameworks :\n\nTensorFlow : When talking about deep learning frameworks this comes first and foremost in the list.It has been 26 months since its initial release and its already topping the charts in one of the most popular open source deep learning framework by Google Brain research team.If you clearly look at the definition of tensorflow in the website it says :\n\n\u201c TensorFlow\u2122 is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them\u201d\n\nThe actual motivation behind TensorFlow was to create a software library for easy,fast numerical computation using data flow graphs using multidimensional data arrays(called tensors). If you use TensorFlow you will better know how tensors work and how these tensors run.While using TensorFlow you have to write a lot of code again and again and reinvent the wheel,that\u2019s why to support high level layers of API\u2019s over TensorFlow they have implemented tf.contrib module containing modules like nn(high level variant of tf.nn),keras( which is a high-level API for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano,which is officially integrated with TensorFlow;we will talk about keras later),etc.\n\nThere is something else Google Brain team has been pushing after TensorFlow to accelerate deep learning research and fill the gap of TensorFlow\u2019s slowness in certain scenarios that is called Tensor2Tensor,which is essentially a extensible library for use with TensorFlow.\n\nOne more exciting thing to try would be the visualization of your network and TensorFlow allows this by giving visualizing tools like TensorBoard.\n\nSummary: TensorFlow supports C++ and Python along to allow computing distribution among CPU, GPU. TensorFlow also has a research cloud called TFRC in which they provide around 1000 TPU\u2019s to accelerate open research.Its slow as cited by many great deep learning scientists there and they prefer using layers like Keras,PrettyTensor,TFLearn etc to act as a high level abstraction over the great computational power of TensorFlow.\n\nCaffe : Caffe was one of the most early veteran deep learning frameworks that came into existence.When you head over the site of Caffe you will see the URL containing \u201cberkleyvision\u201d,as it was created as a part of Berkley AI Research (BAIR) and stands out as a leader framework in computer vision applications.Here is where you can see a demo of how Caffe\u2019s neural network library can be used to implement easy state of the art computer vision systems.As the website of Caffe claims and multiple google searches about caffe will lead you to conclude that caffe is really fast with images as its build with C++ codebase. It has Python and matlab bindings but its documentations are really poor.At times you are redirected to a google docs website where a long ppt of everything but to the implementation of Caffe nets are given,so you have to really give time to dig deep that when and where actual things come.Another painful thing is its installation which has multiple dependencies.So if you want to get started really quick with Caffe you have to find a good blog post that sequentially defines the steps to be done.\n\nCaffe2 :On the other hand Facebook has created a new AI framework joining hands with Nvidia as a partner called Caffe2 which is built essentially over Caffe,thus Caffe2 improves Caffe in variety of directions like : Distributed Computing,extending Caffe2 to non-vision use cases and introducing caffe2 to mobile computing.Its docs are neatly and sequentially created based on levels:Easy,Intermediate,Advanced.Also adding multiple references to state of art neural network learning resources if you are a beginner.Most of the documentations are in Python but if you want more scalability and modularity you may opt to go for C++ in your production systems.\n\nSummary:If you want pure C++ speed and availability to your systems and your use case is computer vision don\u2019t hesitate to put Caffe in your production systems.Use Caffe2 if you want great documentation,non vision use case,distributed computing and mobile computing(there is a great documentation on Caffe2 website for integrating Caffe2 to android/ios devices)\n\nKeras : \u201cYou have just found Keras\u201d,these are the first few words you will find on the website\u2019s homepage.This is my personal favorite so expect some biased writing in this section.\n\nKeras is actually a high level abstraction library that works on top of TensorFlow or Theano.Keras is powerful because it\u2019s really straightforward to create a deep learning model by stacking multiple layers. When using Keras, the user doesn\u2019t have to do the maths behind the layers.\n\nAs a part of Udacity\u2019s Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree,I first came across Keras,it was simple,fluid and straightforward to understand how to chain every block.I built my capstone project using Keras and TensorFlow as back end.Define a model you need,add some layers to it,pick from available losses , optimizers and you are done.Finally use metrics to check your performance.when you want to get things working really fast,Keras enforces a minimalist approach and gets you started in a flash.Here is a comparison of code written in Keras using TensorFlow and raw TensorFlow.\n\nTheano : The beginning of deep learning frameworks starts from Caffe and Theano.It is one of the earliest deep learning library released in 2007 but bundled with SciPy in 2010.I don\u2019t see much of people using only Theano in their deep learning implementations but as I\u2019ve tried once using Theano as backend with Keras gives faster results than using TensorFlow with Keras. This maybe due to its Python interface and integrations with Numpy and SciPy making computations of multi-dimensional arrays faster.Like TensorFlow its a low level library from numerical computation and optimization but its lagging behind compared to its alike libraries because lack of multi-GPU support.\n\nMXNet : Accepted as part of Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Incubator mxnet is the one of the truly open deep learning frameworks.Its the only framework supporting multiple languages like Python,Scala,R,Julia,Perl and C++.Before selecting as an incubator to ASF MXNet was already taken by amazon as its reference library for deeplearning. Now called as Apache MXNet i think there is a lot more to expect from this budding framework.They have built an an API called Gluon which can be used to plug and play neural network building blocks, including predefined layers, optimizers, and initializers just like our beloved keras.\n\nAlso, the community is in parallel working on creating deep learning tutorials from scratch as a part of a book called The Straight Dope. As much of the work is in progress you can also be a part of this open deep learning community by contributing to documentations,tutorials using MXNet. The pace at which this promising open net is growing I am sure it will have a lot to offer from faster implementation to GPU support to beautiful documentations to awesome learning resources and at last a truly open deep learning framework.\n\nDL4J : Any Java fans out there?Feel like everyone is talking about deep learning in Python,C++,R, MATLAB and Java is still hibernating in Object Oriented Realm?You might be wrong.Here is to your celebration,\u201dDeepLearning4Java\u201d is a open source,distributed,deep learning library for the JVM. Not only Java it can run to any of the language supporting JVM like Scala,Clojure or Kotlin.To my surprise Deeplearning4j also has a Python API that employs Keras, and it also enables developers to import models from other frameworks via Keras.\n\nComing to the documentation part of dl4j,its comprehensive,beautiful and awe inspiring.I came to know about its documentation while writing this article and I am overwhelmed of this sweet serendipity.It has everything from Getting started at deep learning,types of neural network and the math behind it,description of Restricted Boltzmann Machines ,Deep Autoencoders are by far the most easy to understand and detailed descriptions I have seen.\n\nTorch:Does anyone knows Lua?Torch is there to lighten up when you want to put GPU\u2019s first.This framework became popular because of it was widely used in facebook research and DeepMind before it was acquired by google.This framework bases its results on extensive paralellization with fast scripting language LuaJIT, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation.\n\nPytorch: One might think is there something common between py**torch** and torch?Are they just implementations of Lua and Python over the same wrapper?The answer seems to be no.Pytorch is basically a Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support.Also,these guys claim that they strictly support use of autograd which is a tape based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch.With Reverse-mode auto-differentiation you can change the way your network behaves without building it from scratch again.At the core, it\u2019s CPU and GPU Tensor and Neural Network backends (TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN) are written as independent libraries with a C99 API.For more clarifications you can read it here.Surprisingly this framework is a tough competitor to TensorFlow or Keras which have been loved by many because of it dynamic graph. In September, fast.ai announced to switch from Keras & TensorFlow to PyTorch. Jeremy Howard, founding researcher at fast.ai and former President and Chief Scientist at Kaggle, thinks that PyTorch will be able to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nMicrosoft developed an internal deep learning framework called CNTK and officially launched the 2.0 version in 2017 after renaming it to the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.In the benchmark published, it seems a very powerful tool for vertical and horizontal scaling.CNTK supports Python,C++ and BrainScript.\n\nONNX : Apart from these frameworks out there if you think you need to at some point of time switch to other framework or if it becomes hard to keep up with latest developments,ONNX a Open Neural Network Exchange comes to rescue.Announced in September of 2017 and the release of V1 in December, ONNX is an open format to represent deep learning models. This allows users to more easily move models between different frameworks. ONNX supports Caffe2, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, MXNet, and PyTorch from the start, but like with other open source projects the community already added a converter for TensorFlow and COREML as well.\n\n4.

        "title": "Difference between Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence",
        "text": "John McCarthy, widely recognized as one of the godfathers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), defined AI as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines that have the ability to achieve goals like humans do\u201d in the year 1955. In short, Artificial Intelligence is human intelligence exhibited by Machines.\n\nArthur Samuel defined Machine Learning (ML) in 1959 as a large sub-field of AI dealing with the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This means a single program, once created, will be able to learn how to do some intelligent activities outside the notion of programming. This contrasts with purpose-built programs whose behavior is defined by hand-crafted heuristics that explicitly and statically define their behavior. So, you can say Machine Learning is an approach to achieve Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThis is exactly how humans learn as well. When any kid learns to identify objects/person, we don\u2019t tell them an algorithm/procedure to identify the features and then decide what is it. We simply show them multiple examples of that object and then our human brain automatically identifies the features (sub-consciously) and learns to identify that object. This is indeed what a Machine Learning Model does.\n\nWithin the machine learning fields, there is an area often referred to as brain-inspired computation. Human brain is one of the best \u2018machine\u2019 we know for learning and solving problems. The brain-inspired technique is indeed inspired by how our human brain works. It is believed that the main computational element of our brain is neuron. The complex connected network of neurons forms the basis of all the decisions made based on the various information gathered. This is exactly what Artificial Neural Network technique does.\n\nWithin the domain of neural networks, there is an area called Deep Learning(DL), in which neural networks have more than three layers, i.e. more than one hidden layer. These neural networks used in Deep learning are called Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).\n\nSo, Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine Learning. Thanks to Deep learning, there are many tasks that machines can now do better than humans. One such example is image classification. In 2015, the ImageNet winning entry, ResNet, exceeded human-level accuracy with a top-5 error rate below 5%. Humans can classify images with error rate 5%.\n\nFig. 2 illustrates the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you look at it from the mathematical terms, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning. Similarly, all deep learning is machine learning but not all machine learning is deep learning.\n\n\u00b7 Machine Learning is an approach to achieve Artificial Intelligence"

        "title": "TensorFlow vs PyTorch \u2013 Udacity India \u2013",
        "text": "TensorFlow was first built and developed by a team at Google Brain. \n\nPyTorch\u2019s origins dates back to October 2002 where it started a scientific computing library called Torch, eventually evolving towards being Machine Learning library.\n\nThis section will talk about differences between the frameworks based on some general metrics.\n\nBoth of the frameworks are well documented and are ready for professional use. However, I am used to TF\u2019s documentation and I find it slightly difficult while using PyTorch\u2019s documentation as the function explanations are limited to one page for each.\n\nBoth of them provide great learning examples to start with, however usability features needs tad improvement in PyTorch.\n\nIn TF, we need to create Session objects and Placeholders help in running the tensors defined. In PyTorch, There\u2019s no need to create any such session objects.\n\nBoth are based on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) \u2014 but internal graph working in PyTorch is taken care when forward() function is called and it works great for RNN models, since it\u2019s dynamic graph creation. It\u2019s called Dynamic Computational Graph (DCG).\n\nVisualisation support of Graphs is offered by TF which is great (Tensorboards). PyTorch is yet to boast that feature.\n\nThe safest way to debug is \u2018print\u2019 statements :-D . Though printing to the console is worth it, some of the inbuilt debug tools do a great job in both the frameworks. Tools like PDB is popular can be used just like any other Python code. There\u2019s also a TF debugger called TFDBG, it\u2019s little clumsy though. Relying on TF\u2019s tensorboards\u2019 viz features is best way to debug in TF.\n\nLastly, TF\u2019s graph model exhibits static behavior, debugging is tough in TF as compared to PyTorch.\n\nTF and PyTorch both support languages other than Python \u2014 CUDA, C++ and C. Need to shell out additional lines of code in TensorFlow, PyTorch is all about writing interface code among the versions of CPU and GPU. Compilation is quite easy and simple, needs no references through headers which is advantageous and promotes easier way to write code.\n\nTensorFlow stands out with Tensorboards Viz feature. \n\nPyTorch stands out with it\u2019s simplicity structure, minimal coding. All thanks to Python!\n\nLearning sources are abundantly available for TensorFlow, expecting the network to grow in PyTorch.\n\nIf you are a beginner in ML, get your hands dirty with PyTorch and eventually try out TensorFlow. :)"

        "title": "So you want to be a Machine Learning Engineer? Here\u2019s what you need to know",
        "text": "Although Machine Learning is a decades-old field, it has gained a lot of momentum in recent years due to the resurgence of Artificial Neural Networks in practical applications. Corporations like Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. are investing a lot of manpower, money, and resources into machine learning, trying to integrate machine learning into almost all of their products. As a result, Machine Learning engineers are in high demand by big corporations as well as by startups. But what does it take to be an awesome machine learning engineer? Well, a few things.\n\nIn order to be a successful machine learning practitioner, the prerequisites that are a must are :\n\nSo, is this enough? If you know all this then you would become a great ML engineer? Not necessarily. Machine Learning is considered to be a bit of an art. It requires a lot of intuition to build efficient ML models. And the only way to develop such intuition is to practice. And then practice some more. And the only way to practice is to build some projects.\n\nYou also need to build credibility as an ML engineer. So build some projects and put them up on Github. Participate in Kaggle competitions. Pick problems and try to solve them using machine learning.\n\nAnd lastly, good luck on your journey because machine learning is one of the most fascinating fields that I have come across and there is no limit as to what you can do with it. So, start learning and build cool things.\n\nWhere to start learning? As I said, there are plenty of resources out there. But one of my favorite resources is Udacity. They offer a ton of great free resources to learn. And if you want to go from scratch to an ML engineer, try their Machine Learning Nanodegree. You can read about my own Udacity Nanodegree experience here.\n\nAnd if you feel intimidated by learning, then remember that the expert in anything was once a beginner."

        "title": "Use cases of Artificial Intelligence in different industries",
        "text": "\u201cArtificial Intelligence encompasses a huge variety of subfields, ranging from the general (learning and perception) to the specifics, such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, driving a car on a crowded street, and diagnosing diseases. AI is relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal field.\u201d\n\nThe above lines are taken from the book \u2018Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\u2019 by Stuart J. Russell & Peter Norvig. These lines rightly capture the various areas in which AI will, and, is affecting our lives. Historically, we have seen the application of AI techniques to the problems of game-playing and the development of search agents. The game-playing agents such as \u2018AlphaGo\u2019 make use of several important artificial intelligence concepts. Their paper [1] introduces a new approach to master the computer program for playing the game of Go by using value networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks to select moves. The deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human-expert games and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. The paper also introduces a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. With these search algorithms, the program AlphaGo, achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.\n\nFig 1: AlphaGo from DeepMind playing the game of Go with South Korea\u2019s Lee Sedol. Image source (A1)\n\nAn AI technique called \u2018Constraint Satisfaction\u2019 [2] is used in a variety of places like solving Sudoku problems, determining colors on map such that no two adjacent blocks have same color, solving the N-queens problem, etc.\n\nFig 2: The map coloring problem applied to Germany and its states. Image source (A2)\n\nAnother AI technique that is widely used in the industries is the \u2018Planning Search\u2019. This is applied in the kinds of problems where we have to find an optimum path from source to destination given a variety of paths and constraints. A typical example can be routing of a Cargo from one city to another, or devising an optimum path for an autonomous vehicle to follow. The Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) [3] was one of the earliest attempts at solving these kinds of problems. Recent advancements in the domain such as Reviving Partial Order Planning (RePOP) [4] have made significant improvements in the execution flexibility.\n\nRecently we are seeing the re-emergence of Deep Learning, another subfield of AI, and its applications to a lot of areas such as developing agents that can make use of the visual information around them and take decisions \u2014 self-driving cars, understand the voice commands and take necessary actions \u2014 voice user interfaces such as Alexa, or solve complex queries and understand the meaning of large quantities of text \u2014 natural language processing (IBM Watson) with zero or minimal human interventions. In fact, the recent advent of chatbots, such as that can answer your queries instantly and accurately are another manifestation of the developments in the AI algorithms.\n\nBut AI is not only solving complex and big problems as mentioned above. It is also being used in some very simple forms in our day to day lives. A smart thermostat that can adjust the room temperature according to the changing dynamics of its surrounding environment, a simple vacuum cleaner that navigates itself around the house, the tic-tac-toe player that plays with you online, an email categorizer and spam filter, all use some form of AI everyday to make our lives better.\n\nIf you are interested in diving into this exciting field of Artificial Intelligence, and are confused about where to begin, I would recommend looking at the Udacity\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. A lot of the concepts and applications that I have talked about are a part of the course. The application oriented nature of the course will leave you well equipped to tackle some of the challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence and their complementary career-services/career fairs will enable you to find amazing opportunities in the industry.\n\nI wish you all the best in your journey.\n\nReferences used in the article:\n\n[1] Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C.J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., Van Den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Antonoglou, I., Panneershelvam, V., Lanctot, M. and Dieleman, S., 2016.

        "text": "You have just learnt the basics of a programming language at school or college or through an online course. You now know the basic components of a program. You are also able to solve some basic problems using small amounts of code.\n\nBut somehow when you are writing pieces of codes in professional capacity, you are always making multiple changes in your code and are constantly discussing things over long meetings. Maybe you are not as good a programmer as you thought you were?\n\nI was faced with an exactly the same kind of problem a couple of years back, when I started my career as a software developer working on large code bases and developing pieces of software that would run in production and impact thousands of systems. Fortunately for me, I had the support of extremely patient peers and colleagues who were kind enough to spend some of their valuable time guiding me. These were people who had almost 15 to 20 years of experience writing programs that were efficient, easy to debug and easy to modify in face of frequent changes in requirements.\n\nIn this post I will list a few resources that were recommended by these seasoned programmers and why every programmer should have a look at them as well. Going through these resources surely changed the way I approached the problems and made me realize the immense knowledge that is still to be gained.\n\nHere are some of the recommended readings for anyone who wants to program for a living:\n\nIf you are also working with developing analytics solutions, using machine learning in your work and are looking to get a better understanding of the various algorithms that you are working with, then you should also have a look at these books:\n\nThe second list of books are not for light reading and require a sufficient amount of devotion. I am still reading some of them even after 2 years and going back to them multiple times for better understanding. However, they are all worth your time and will definitely reward you over the next couple of years as we work on more complex problems and design more sophisticated systems.\n\nGood luck on your journey to becoming a better programmer \ud83d\ude03"

        "title": "Applications of Machine Learning in Fintech sector \u2013 Udacity India \u2013",
        "text": "Financial world presents a lot of opportunities to apply various machine learning techniques. Financial world is based on quantitative figures and statistics which is perfectly suited as a use case for data analytics, a sub field of machine learning. Even highly volatile and not easily interpretable phenomenons, even for human experts, such as market analysis and future prediction, machine learning models such as text/sentiment analysis, semantic analysis can come to rescue.\n\nHigh frequency trading (HFT) also known as algorithmic trading is the use of sophisticated computer algorithms and advanced electronic tools to fuel quantitative trading for high traffic, speed and turnover by setting up an automated pipeline with some sort of \u2018human intelligence\u2019 supervision. As trading and market continues to grow it\u2019s only reasonable and to the best of interest of financial industry that we employ some sort of automation pipeline. Based on various kinds of data from history we can have ML models trained for this exact purpose. In order to ensure accidental oversights and errors there can be human experts to approve/disapproved decisions made with confidence lower than the threshold.\n\nDetecting fraudulent and anomalous activities in financial sector is very crucial and equally difficult to accomplish too. Difficulty lies due to the fact that the wrong players come up with newer and newer tactics to game the system. Having a pre set rules to accomplish this task is simply not going to work in the long run because of the sheer dynamicity of the problem in hand. Having a constantly learning ML model which keeps changing and adapting to the new data, preferably some sort of reinforcement learning variation, can help solve this problem.\n\nFinancial planning is a very critical task not just for organizations and corporations but even for individuals. Keeping track of finances, making decisions regarding investment and trading require a detailed knowledge and analysis of what\u2019s going on in the fintech world. The growing magnitude of data and information in this segment is simply impossible to be reckoned with for human analysts. This is where the concept of robo-advisers has sprung up in the recent years where machine learning is used for financial planning.\n\nLoan underwriting is the process of assessing the risk before sanctioning loan or mortgage to an individual by the banks. Again, this is a huge domain. There could be literally millions of applications and to determine which one is eligible and which one is not is not an easy task. In order to evaluate such applications we can train a ML model against a dataset which contains various parameters of the applicant and the risk involved. Assisted with human intelligence this gigantic problem can be greatly simplified even to determine creditworthiness of insurance policy, regulatory and compliance risk assessment for individuals as well as organizations.\n\nSome sort of customer interaction is sought after just about in any industry dealing with finance. Most of these can now be handled using engaging conversational chatbots. These are guaranteed to be more factually correct (considered trained with proper data) and are less error prone because various human factors of judgement and prejudices are eliminated. Now with advance speech synthesis and improved human computer interaction accessing financial data and insights is easier than ever which gives a leverage to each individual to make better financial decisions.\n\nIn finance and economics there are a lot of emergent behaviours that cannot be explained clearly. Stock market is a perfect example. There is no central planning in place to direct stock prices. It\u2019s a cumulative result of the decisions made by thousands of investors based on their limited knowledge and intuition. Mathematically modelling such behaviours is not possible and thus ML comes into play. There are chances that the machine learning model itself might not be very interpretable but overall employing ML models in such scenarios is guaranteed to yield far useful and better insights. Talking about emergent behavior, the world wide web (WWW) is another example. We never know to what direction the overall opinion is going to swing to. Based on social media platforms and news trends financial industries have to constantly keep up with their next strategy in order to maximize profit. There are already numerous firms for micro-targeting markets for advertisements and infamously even for electoral politics as revealed by the recent Cambridge Analytica Scandal. The legal and ethical standards behind such practices must be regulated and individual\u2019s data should never be at stake. But for the most of the cases these principles work on anonymized dataset."

        "title": "Machine Learning for Finance \u2013 Udacity India \u2013",
        "text": "The finance domain has seen huge disruption by Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence in the recent times. The age-old brick and mortar banking systems are likely to be replaced by the new age FinTech organizations if they fail to keep pace with the new advances in technologies. Financial companies are now using machine learning to detect frauds in real time. Investment banks are now using machine learning to create what is known as robo-advisor which helps their customers to manage portfolios and many more applications like this have disrupted this industry.\n\nBut, machine learning in finance does not work the same way as it works in other domains, because of several reasons. In finance, most of the data are of medium size (not big data as we commonly see in tech companies like Google, Facebook) except high-frequency trading. Another property of financial data, that it is non-stationary which means that if we collect data from an economic regime which do not have any relation with the current economic scenarios that data is meaningless. So, in finance domain, collecting more data even if it possible is of no use. The next property of financial data is the noise-to-signal ratio. Financial data generally has a high noise-to-signal ratio, i.e. financial data are very noisy and it is difficult to observe the patterns or signals in the data. Another dimension of data in financial modelling is the uncertainty. In finance, uncertainty is very high, for example uncertainties associated with quantitative trading, commodities trading, foreign exchange rates etc or uncertainties in political-economic events like Brexit, uncertainty is commonplace in financial modelling. The next characteristics of finance modelling is the interpretability of the data. Interpretability of financial modelling is desired for trading, banking or other financial applications because of the complex nature of financial business problems. Keeping all these characteristics in mind we can divide most of the financial modelling applications in three broad categories of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. \n\nSupervised learning mainly consists of regression and classification problems. Regression is the most common machine learning techniques used in finance. Stock return prediction, credit loss forecasting, algorithmic trading are few examples of regression problems. Classification is also widely in finance applications. Rating prediction, default modelling, credit card fraud modelling, anti-money laundering are few examples of classification tasks in finance.\n\nUnsupervised learning in finance, where we do not have the target labels mainly consists of clustering and representation learning problems. Segmentation of stocks, segmentation of credit card holders (or customers in a broader sense) are examples of clustering problems in finance. Representation learning is also widely used in the finance, for instance, factor modelling, principal component analysis, de-noising of data, regime change detection are few examples of representation learning in finance. \n\nReinforcement learning which generally performs action-oriented tasks is also widely used in finance. Reinforcement learning involves optimization of strategy for a given problem, for example finding optimized trading strategies or building optimized strategy for asset management problem. The other variant of reinforcement learning is the inverse reinforcement learning, which aims to learn the objectives from the behaviour of customers/agents. For instance, generating insights about the preferences of your customers which can be used to offer them a better product or services.\n\nStart your career in Machine Learning with Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree .\n\nNo programming Experience?

        "title": "Machine Learning Programming Languages \u2014 which is the best and why?",
        "text": "Machine Learning\u2019s theoretical foundation dates to 1763 when Bayes Theorem was discovered. The first learning machine was also discovered as early as year 1950 by Alan Turing. But, this decade is truly the decade of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. This is purely because of adoption of various machine learning techniques to make machines intelligent (artificially for now). This adoption is possible purely because of three reasons: 1. Huge amount of data available 2. Enough computational power 3. New techniques like Deep Neural Network making machine better than humans in lot of tasks like image classification, audio synthesis etc.\n\nWith machine learning gaining more and more adoptability, almost every popular language is adding their support to ease the ML tasks. These are the four popular languages that comes to my mind when thinking about doing machine learning.\n\nThere can be multiple metrics to decide on the right programming language among the above. Those are:\n\nAlso, among other less popular DNN frameworks (like Theano), python is the only language that has universal support. This gives python a clear edge over other languages.\n\n6. Production Ready: R is more suited for statistical analysis. Matlab and octave are more suited for computer vision related tasks, but python is more suited for any generic tasks \u2014 like data pre-processing, results post-processing. Also, python being generic enough makes it more suitable if there is a need to integrate ML with other software.\n\nTaking above metric into consideration if we give 1 point to the language where it has an edge over others, the summary looks like the table below:\n\nBased on the summary, it\u2019s evident that Python is a better choice over other languages mainly because it being generic enough that it not just good for statistical/machine-learning related tasks but other generic tasks and having better support for all DNN frameworks like Tensorflow, Caffe. But, R can be very handy for a quick prototype that doesn\u2019t need to use DNN frameworks. So, to summarize, R is the choice of language for a quick prototype but for long term python is the most preferred language."

        "title": "How Machine Learning will revolutionize Marketing and Advertising",
        "text": "One of the major subjects concerning the future of technology and other various fields associated with it today is: \u201cHow is Machine learning and AI going to affect X?\u201d. There are worries about its regulation and usage and in the same time there is overwhelming optimism about the good things that AI and ML are and will be capable of accomplishing.Artificial Intelligence itself is a broad Umbrella terms encompassing various fields of study like Machine learning, Data Science, Statistics and so on. Sure, Machine learning is hyped up now by industries and academia alike and there are skeptics considering the fact that big companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft are looking for new ways to incentivize on this opportunity. The entry barrier to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence has been decreasing and we are witnessing the incorporation of Machine learning into various fields. As the web continues to proliferate and the sheer volume of data outgrows the capacity of our computing machines, it\u2019s various clever machine learning and optimization techniques that are going to be of any help. We have a limited computing resource (computers, programmers included) and the problem space is unlimited and is bound to increase non-stop which calls for a new paradigm of problem solving and engineering. We are getting to witness that machine learning is that new paradigm. Out of numerous areas which could leverage the power of machine learning like finance, healthcare and medicines, education I am going to focus on marketing and Advertising which have a very huge influence on our lifestyles in this digital age.\n\nMarketing and Advertising have been flourishing since the advent of digital media at a rapid rate. First it must have been the Radios, Televisions and the newspapers where advertisers could reach out to millions of people instantly. After the world wide web was built on top of the Internet a whole new door of digital media lay open. Web became the place to advertise. Big giants like Google and Facebook\u2019s primary source of revenue is advertising. Web didn\u2019t limit itself to pages. Streaming services for both videos, audios and now Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) sprang open. Web started becoming more and more personal to different users and this is where we are witnessing the power of machine learning.\n\nWhen advertising and marketing something in a giant pool such as the world wide web one of the problems that has baffled many marketing and advertising gurus has been how to maintain relevance at scale. Producers want to reach out to maximum number of audiences with their products who might actually be interested. As a general individual spends a majority of time in the internet doing transactions, visiting blogs and news articles, engaging in social media, buying stuffs online, interacting with bots there are innumerable ways s/he is sending her signals. These signals when captured efficiently, pruned and processed can give us a very coherent and detailed digital persona of the individual. Making maximum use of these signals we can create a machine learning model and use it to target consumers with products they might be interested in. In fact we can see that this is already happening.\n\nAs we browse the web our digital identity is almost always tracked gathering more signals about what we like. Marketing and advertising platforms can use this data and in real time they can advertise the suitable products to us. In fact it\u2019s not surprising that you search for some commodity to buy in Amazon and when you log into facebook you can already see the advertisements showing up in timeline.\n\nOne huge limiting factor in conventional marketing and advertising is Market Analysis. Still majority of the companies have \u2018Sales and Marketing\u2019 guys doing laborious manual work of market analysis, working over excel sheets, chasing targets. This process is very inefficient and error prone. There is a huge cost involved which is always at stake of the effectiveness of the outcome of whole operation. Us human beings can be trained in a particular domain and get really good at it but the problem is domain keeps changing almost every single day. There are way too many signals out there and to decide which one to pursue and which not to is a very big decision and involves a lot of risk behind it. With such a huge dataset of very high variance (too many features, we can\u2019t afford to lose some and can\u2019t come to conclusion with many features and few observations) it\u2019s only sub disciplines of machine learning like Deep learning that can come to rescue. The whole realm of market sizing and analysis can be automated using machine learning techniques.\n\nOne of the major advancements in the machine learning in the recent years apart from emerging new techniques and ideas has been the infrastructural development. It has become relatively easier if someone wants to foray into machine learning and leverage it in their product solution architecture. We have ready to train and deploy cloud infrastructures like Google\u2019s Cloud ML Engine. We have various well tested frameworks and libraries open sourced if we wish to build our own ML solutions and tinker under the hood. Google\u2019s Tensorflow and Python Scikit library are the perfect example. Even for mobile devices we have lighter versions of these frameworks like tensorflow lite which work by utilizing the power of cloud infrastructure. As we advance further in this digital age, its becoming more and more likely that even a basic understanding of Machine learning and it\u2019s applications can give an individual a prophetic power and a vision that\u2019s more likely to yield fruitful results."

        "title": "My experience with Udacity\u2019s Machine Learning Nanodegree Program",
        "text": "I graduated from Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree in July,2017 and I will be sharing how it has helped me learn,grow and apply my gained nanodegree skills to real world problems.\n\nWhat is Nanodegree anyway?\n\nA regular degree from a university takes around 4 years to complete. A regular degree also has a few core courses, some electives, and some open-ended projects. Regular degrees provide certification to signal that the student is ready to work in a field.\n\nA Nanodegree program is like a regular degree in the sense that it also has some core parts and electives. But the timeline for a Nanodegree program is much smaller, around 6\u201312 months. (hence \u2018nano\u2019). Udacity partners with different companies like Kaggle, Facebook, and Google for creating courses. Each Nanodegree program finishes with a capstone project. Students apply their knowledge gained in the coursework to the capstone in novel ways.\n\nI am a software developer having 2 years of experience in software development.My interest in machine learning piqued in final year of my engineering degree in which i was making a project using machine learning techniques.Since then i am continuously adding machine learning skills to my portfolio.But until completing my nanodegree i had only theoretical knowledge of machine learning.Udacity\u2019s MLND ensures that each term finishes with a project so as to give the student practical application of the gained skills.\n\nUdacity lists their prerequisites on the MLND homepage.\n\nThe Machine Learning Nanodegree program is now split up in two sub modules which was not there earlier.It facilitates a beginner to quickly pick up the track and an advanced to quickly choose the right course needed.\n\n>Basics : Contains two technical project with minimal prerequisites.\n\n>Advanced : Contains three technical projects including one capstone project.\n\nEach project has video lectures and in-lecture quizzes for practice.Each project has its own rubric. Reviewers grade projects based on these rubrics. Students can submit as many times as they like. Project submission is either via Github repository or zipped files.\n\nWhat is unique to Udacity is the peer review system in which the reviewers not only review your project submission but also give you additional friendly comments on strategy,machine learning trends and resources to read more about a particular topic of the project.Each project has a timeline duration in which you have to submit the project as github link or zipped files.\n\nI\u2019ll briefly cover my version of the syllabus which may be different from what is there now as Udacity keeps on reviewing and updating the project and course content to keep it industry ready.\n\nEach project container boilerplate python code in jupyter notebooks with instructions step by step so that you can start off quickly and code only what is required.\n\nThis is an optional project using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It\u2019s a classification problem where we have to predict the survival outcome of passengers. It\u2019s supposed to get students familiar with the submission and review cycle.\n\nThis is one of the mandatory projects. It uses supervised learning techniques to predict the price of houses in the Boston area. It\u2019s a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository . The goal is to choose the best performing model using supervised learning.\n\nThis is a classification problem where the task is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate.This project has been replaced by a newer version in current curriculum.\n\nUnsupervised learning techniques like PCA and clustering are explored here with the wholesale customers dataset from the UCI repository.\n\nThe lessons in this project focus on reinforcement learning. The goal is to take a smartcab from a starting point to an end point by giving it feedback through reinforcement learning.\n\nThis project implements deep learning methods to CIFAR-10 dataset using Tensorflow.\n\nThe capstone is the final technical project in the MLND. It\u2019s divided into two parts: proposal and project implementation. Students are supposed to choose a technical problem from a domain they are interested in, write-up a proposal, solve the problem using machine learning techniques, and submit a final report for the project.\n\nThis capstone project is what unique to Udacity.The proposal and implementation parts lets you document your project and your approach process so that you actually do a research on a particular topic just like writing a research paper.Its thoroughly reviewed by Udacity reviewers with friendly comments on places to improve.\n\nI worked on the Kaggle Invasive species monitoring competition using Keras for my capstone. It was a binary image classification problem.It took me a lot of research on which model to use which technique to use and document it in proper format as given by the capstone project rubric.But this helped get to know the research paper writing process and its implementation and later I published my own research paper in a national conference on machine learning.\n\nStudents who successfully complete all the program requirements earn and receive their Nanodegree credential.\n\nEach Nanodegree program has its own discussion forums. MLND also has a slack channel where many former graduates give advice. Also with new Udacity 1 to 1 mentorship be it a small doubt about course or be it if you are stuck in your projects you will always find someone to help.Also the project reviewers comments on your submitted projects gives you their experienced knowledge that you will not find easily.\n\nMy experience with this program has helped me to learn how to research, experiment, and finish an open-ended machine learning project on my own. It taught me how to start a project from scratch,document it and explain it to someone else.As said earlier the reviewers were incredibly helpful and gave leads to many great resources that you won\u2019t find just searching.\n\nEnroll Now into Machine Learning Nanodegree here\n\nEngineer by profession,Writer by heart and Musician by soul."

        "text": "I was always interested in Artificial Intelligence from an early age. It\u2019s potential and applications filled me with an inspiring awe. Adaptation of Artificial Intelligence in Hollywood like Iron Man and I, Robot showed great promise about the wonders of AI to a me as a kid. But, I had no idea on how to get started in this field practically. I first came to know about Machine Learning when Google open sourced TensorFlow in November 2015. I tried to understand the framework myself but could not make much progress at first. I had previously done a few free courses from Udacity and enjoyed their teaching style and content quality. I had been coding in Python since 2015 and fortunately it turned out to be the language of choice for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. Therefore, I finally enrolled in Machine Learning Nanodegree in 2017 after self-learning the libraries NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn for a few months.\n\nThe content of Udacity Nanodegree program is a perfect balance of equal parts theory and practical knowledge. The lecturers first explained theoretical concepts related to Maths and Algorithms, and then showed how to implement them in code.\n\nThe video lectures were intermittently followed by mini-exercises which served as points for revision and milestones in learning progress. If I ever got stuck on any topic, the Forums on Udacity and Slack team were always there to help. This was indeed the best part of Nanodegree experience for me. The Slack team has thousands of talented individuals who were either completing the Nanodegree or graduated from it. Therefore, someone was always there to help, no matter what time you ask a question. And instead of spilling the answer directly, they help you guide yourself towards it which is a great learning experience. Being a part of such an awesome community was a new and exhilarating experience for me.\n\nTo keep you on track, you are assigned a mentor until you complete your project. The mentor is available for 2\u20133 days/week. They are people with sound knowledge in Machine Learning and help you in every aspect to progress forward. My mentor guided me a lot when it came to complete my project. The initial boost gained by them helped me to complete the Nanodegree even after their unavailability.\n\nThe submission system for MLND allowed for two options: -\n\nI always preferred submission through a GitHub repository and I urge anyone reading this to do the same because it shows all your work (including your mistakes and how you fixed them) to others and also builds your portfolio.\n\nFor each project, there is a rubric stating the requirements clearly. The submission format was of Jupyter Notebooks. Earlier I was accustomed to using Python scripts for Machine Learning through the course of Nanodegree, I fell in love with Jupyter Notebooks which provide a perfect way to blend Code, Visualization and Documentation in a single file. I now use them on a regular basis and prefer them over plain scripts whenever needed.\n\nReviewers \u2014 The stars of the Nanodegree\n\nGoing through my project reviews felt simply awesome. Whenever, I failed to meet any requirements, the reviewer mentioned it clearly and showed possible workarounds. The project review was completely mapped to the rubric and hence it was super easy to zero in on the errors. Also, even when I had completed a requirement correctly, the reviewer discussed other possible methods to achieve it, which helped to expand my knowledge a lot.\n\nThe MLND curriculum consisted of the following sections when I graduated from it: -\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to complete them in the order specified, but this order would be beneficial if you are completely unfamiliar to Machine Learning. In fact, I attempted to complete Deep Learning section after Model Evaluation and Validation but after a failed try I returned to the original order. This only proved useful because by the time I sequentially reached Deep learning, it was more comprehendible. I got hands on experience of Keras library which was previously not a part of the project.\n\nThe Capstone project is a nice inclusion to the curriculum. It gave me a brief idea about the entire process which Machine Learning Engineers follow while solving a problem. It allows you to choose a problem/dataset of your choice and complete the following steps: -\n\nAnd the best part is that even though your idea is not ground breaking, or a convention defying research you still get acquainted with the entire Machine Learning process, which is a crucial factor for preparing you for a job in Machine Learning.\n\nMy Key Takeaways from the Nanodegree"

Trust me it will make you addictive towards learning.\n\n\u201cIn general every one of us is a teacher.\u201d \u2014 OK\u2026.Is it possible to teach a machine? Fortunately YES!!! This is where I started. I was fed up of manually deleting duplicate & blurry images from directories. Since I am a passionate CSE guy , I tried to find a solution to this problem by using technology, & at last I found a way to build a model using Machine Learning. I started learning Machine Learning especially fell in love with a section in Machine Learning known as Deep Learning.\n\nI believe it will open the doors of intelligence one by one for a machine in particular conditions. I enrolled in Deep Learning Nanodgree with a fear(will I make it?)but now I have the courage to complete my nanodgree. Thanks to Udacity! It formed a one way bridge between fear and courage. Every quiz at videos made me more intuitive about the concepts. I would sometimes jump into other sections of the course just for brief insight. During the process I got a lot of exposure in the form of :\n\n2. Project review \u2014 they have excellent supporting review system where I learnt in depth about some difficult concepts like parameter tuning.\n\n3. Forums \u2014 a place to learn and clarify doubts with a great community.\n\n3. Mentor support \u2014 a dedicated mentor checks your progress every week.I am lucky to have my mentor @NG Fang.\n\n4. AWS credits \u2014 gpu support is the best part for experimenting on projects.\n\nIn section-1 a good knowledge about deep learning along with some basics was given.\n\nIn section-2 I learned how to build a neural network, how neural network works, how to tune the parameters much more. After completing the section I had submitted a project. Working on this project review gave me a complete practical overview on the neural network.\n\nGoing through section-3 I learned about CNN and image processing to build a neural network, which analyzes dog image and predicts it\u2019s breed. I found this project the most amazing and fun project of all.\n\nMoving on to section-4 I built a RNN in tensor flow to process text and generate a new TV script.\n\nAt present I am going through section-5 where I will soon build a pair of multi layer neural networks and make them compete with each other in order to generate faces.\n\nAt every project I had a milestone to achieve, but still I came through. All thanks to the amazing support and help that my mentors and community gave me! The best part of Udacity is that it flexibly fir with my time & weekly goals and bracket due dates helped me to stay on track.\n\n\u201cDelay is nothing decision is everything\u201d"

        "text": "I had an opportunity to go through Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program(MLND) during the period of 2016\u20132017. The underlying motivation for choosing this program is industry relevant curriculum, projects and more importantly industry recognition. Below are some of the highlights and features of the nanodegree program.\n\nMLND consists of mandatory Core curriculum and optional Extra curriculum.The core curriculum consists of the following topics\n\nMLND is unique with respect to the structure. For each of these topics there is an associated project that needs to be submitted . This gets reviewed by reviewers as per the project rubric. The review is shared quickly and an opportunity to resubmit with improvements is provided. This helps grasp concepts and also polish the project submission. Once the submission is approved , this gets added to the dashboard which can be used as our profile.\n\nFollowing are the list of project which I had submitted as part of Udacity MLND:\n\nMachine Learning Capstone project is an integral component of the nanodegree program. This consists of submitting a proposal and then executing the project. Udacity provides resources such as guidelines and necessary templates to complete both the proposal and the final project report. I had selected an existing Kaggle problem where a driver\u2019s behaviour is to be predicted based on the image. CNN was developed as a baseline model in Keras. To further improve the model pre-trained model such as VGG16 was used and transfer learning was applied.Finally fine-turning was applied to arrive at the final algorithm for predicting driver\u2019s behaviour based on the given image.\n\nUdacity also provide one-one appointments with mentors so that we can obtain necessary feedback during the execution of Capstone project. This is an excellent opportunity to fine-tune the project before final submission.\n\nOnce all the projects submissions were successful and Capstone project is completed, the students were awarded the nanodegree certification after verifying their identity. Below is my nanodegree certification.\n\nOverall it was an excellent experience undergoing the nanodegree program. The variety of projects along with guidelines for capstone project by Udacity enriched my knowledge and increased my curiosity in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning."

        "title": "Why Python is the most popular language used for Machine Learning",
        "text": "Back in 1991 when Guido van Rossum released Python as his side project, he didn\u2019t expected that it would be the world\u2019s fastest growing computer language in the near future. If we follow the trends, Python turns out as a goto language for fast prototyping.\n\n\u201cPython shot to the most wanted language this year\u201d.\n\nIf we look at the philosophy of the Python language, you can say that this language was built for its readability and less complexity. You can easily understand it and make someone understand very fast.\n\nYou can read it for yourself. Just use below command in Python\n\nAlso Python wins the hearts of the users. According to the Hackerrank 2018 developer survey(https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/) \u201cJavaScript may be the most in-demand language by employers, but Python wins the heart of developers across all ages, according to our Love-Hate index.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s understand why would anyone want to use only Python in designing any Machine Learning project. Machine learning, in layman terms, is to use the data to make a machine make intelligent decision. For example \u2014 You can build a spam detection algorithm where the rules can be learned from the data or an anomaly detection of rare events by looking at previous data or arranging your email based on tags you had assigned by learning on email history and so on.\n\nMachine learning is nothing but to recognise patterns in your data.\n\nAn important task of a Machine learning engineer in his/her work life is to extract, process, define, clean, arrange and then understand the data to develop intelligent algorithms.\n\nSo for a Machine learning engineer/Computer Vision Engineer like me or a budding Data Scientist/Machine Learning/Algorithm Engineer/Deep learning engineer why I would recommend Python, because it\u2019s easy to understand.\n\nSometimes the concepts of Linear Algebra, Calculus are so complex, that they take the maximum amount of effort. A quick implementation in Python helps a ML engineer to validate an idea.\n\nSo it totally depends on the type of the task where you want to apply Machine learning. I work in computer vision projects. So the input data for me is the image or video. For someone else it would be a series of points over time or collection of language documents spreaded across various domains or audio files given or just some numbers.\n\nImagine everything that exists around you is data. And it\u2019s raw, unstructured, bad, incomplete, large. How Python can tackle all of them ? Lets see.\n\nYes you guessed it right. It\u2019s the collection and code stack of various open source repositories which is developed by people (still in process ) to continuously improve upon the existing methods.\n\nWant to work with images \u2014 numpy, opencv, scikit\n\nWant to work in text \u2014 nltk, numpy, scikit\n\nWant to work in audio \u2014 librosa\n\nWant to see the data clearly \u2014 matplotlib, seaborn, scikit\n\nWant to use deep learning \u2014 tensorflow, pytorch\n\nWant to do scientific computing \u2014 scipy\n\nWant to take a shower \u2026. Well\n\nThe best thing about using these packages is that they have zero learning curve. Once you have a basic understanding of Python, you can just implement it. They are free to use under GNU license. Just import the package and use.\n\nIf you do not want to use any of them, you can easily implement the functionality from scratch(which most of the developers do).\n\nYes it\u2019s not fast and takes more space but \u2026\n\nThe main reason or the only reason why Python will never be used very widely is because of the overhead it brings in. But to clear the case, it was never built for the system but for the usability. Small processors or low memory hardware won\u2019t accommodate Python codebase today, but for such cases we have C and C++ as our development tools.\n\nIn my case, when we implement an algorithm(Neural network) for a particular task, we use python(tensorflow). But for deployment in real systems where speed matters we switch to C.\n\nEaster egg \u2014 Cython is in development for many years. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython]. You get the readability of Python, but efficiency of C.\n\nOkay enough of the talk, now show me the way.\n\nNow we know the Why. Lets see the How.\n\nBefore jumping into any field of computer science, its very important to understand how the machine perceives the data. The atomic unit of value in C is 1 byte. Using the same byte we can code each input from the universe. If I were to make a list of things then, go to each and every implementation of data structures. This tutorial (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) would be a good starting point.\n\nOnce you get a understanding of the basics, jump into tutorial series of Learn Python the hard way by Zed Shaw. One of the statements from the book tells you that the hard way is easier. The foundation should always be strong.\n\nThe implementation of a clustering algorithm will open your insights more about the problem then just reading the algorithm. Here when a user implements the things in Python, it is going to be much faster to prototype the code and test it. One simple case of K means clustering is explained in following blog \u2014 K means in Python\n\nWhenever you implement a piece of code, always keep in mind that an equivalent optimised code is always there. Keep asking your peers that whether they can understand the underlying functionality by just seeing the code stack. Use of meaningful variables, modularity of code, comments, no hard coding are keypoint areas which make a piece of code complete.\n\nWorld\u2019s most popular frameworks for data scientist are Excel and SAS. The problem of using them is they can\u2019t handle large datasets and less community support for wide variety of usage i.e. You can\u2019t use Excel to handle a company\u2019s raw data.\n\nMATLAB also provides great libraries and packages for specific tasks of image analysis. You can find great number of toolboxes for the given task. The main con of using MATLAB is that it is very slow(execution time is slow). It can\u2019t be used in deployment, but only for prototyping. Also it\u2019s not free to use, unlike python which is open.\n\nAnother great tool is R. It\u2019s open source, free and made for statistical analysis. In my view, Python is a great tool for the development of programs which perform data manipulation whereas R is a statistical software which works on a particular format of dataset. Python provides the various development tools which can be used to work with other systems.\n\nR has a learning curve to it. The predefined functions need predefined input. In Python you can play around the data.\n\nWell if we focus on the overall task which is needed to train, validate and test the models \u2014 as far as it satisfy the aim of the problem, any language/tool/framework can be used. Be it extracting raw data from an API, analyzing it, doing an in depth visualization and making an classifier for the given task.\n\nBut the main reason for using Python would be its readability, versatility and easiness."

        "text": "Recently I wrote about my experience with the Udacity\u2019s Self Driving Car Nanodegree (SDCND).\n\nWhile pursuing this Nanodegree, I was so thrilled by the course material, that I decided to enroll in another nano-degree from Udacity at the end of my Term 2 of SDCND. This was the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. The first two terms of the SDCND had helped me to master the basics of Deep Learning and I wanted to explore some of the applications of Deep Learning in other domains like Natural Language Processing (think IBM Watson) and Voice User Interfaces (think Amazon Alexa). The AI-ND seemed like the perfect place to achieve this, partly due to my fantastic experience with the previous Udacity NDs.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree is a bit different from the other NDs. There are a total of 4 terms and you need to pay for and complete two of them in order to graduate. In case you desire, you can also enroll for the other modules as well and complete them.\n\nThe first term is common and compulsory for all. It teaches you the foundations of AI like Game-Playing, Search, Optimization, Probabilistic AIs, and Hidden Markov Models. The topics are taught by some of the pioneers of AI like Prof. Sebastian Thrun, Prof. Peter Norvig, and Prof. Thad Starner. All the topics are covered in detail with links to additional research papers and book chapters for additional study.\n\nThe course begins with an interesting project of creating a program to solve the Sudoku problem using the concepts of Search and Constraint Propagation. You get an opportunity to play with various heuristics as you try to design an optimum strategy for the game.\n\nThe next project continues from this by implementing an adversarial search agent to play the game of Isolation. Some of the topics that were covered included MinMax, AlphaBeta Search, Iterative Deepening, etc. The project also required an analysis of a research paper. I performed the review of the famous AlphaGo paper, which can be found on my GitHub project page.\n\nFrom game-playing agents we moved onto the domain of planning problems. I experimented with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems. Like the previous project, this one also required you to perform a research review.\n\nFrom planning, we moved to the domain of probabilistic inference. The final project of Term 1 required the understanding of Hidden Markov Models to design a sign-language recognizer. You also get an understanding of the different model selection techniques such as Log likelihood using cross-validation folds, Bayesian Information Criterion and Discriminative Information Criterion.\n\nThe next term focused on the concepts and applications of Deep Learning. It covered the basic concepts of Deep Learning like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Semi-supervised learning, etc. and then moved onto the latest developments in the filed like the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). At the end of the module, there was an option to choose a specialization. The three options available were Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Voice User Interfaces. Since the SDCND had already exposed me to the domain of computer vision and I had already worked on some NLP projects and gone through the Stanford\u2019s CS224d to some extent, I decided to pursue the Voice User Interfaces Specialization. The project involved building a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The pipeline accepts raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language. Some of the network architectures that I experimented with were RNN; RNN + TimeDistributed Dense; CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense; Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense and Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense.\n\nOne of the major feature of the projects was the research component. To pass any project you had to give a detailed scientific reasoning and empirical evidence for your implementations and programs. This helped me to develop the skill of critical thinking and efficient problem solving. As is true with any nano-degree, this course was also full of interactions with people from around the world and from all aspects of industry. It was also heavily focused on applications which kept me excited for the entire duration of six-months.\n\nI have continued my learning from this course by following the books \u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2014 A modern approach\u201d by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig and \u201cDeep Learning\u201d by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. I still have a long way to go before I master this interesting field of AI, but the nano-degree has definitely shown me the way forward."

        "title": "My experience with Udacity Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program",
        "text": "When I entered college, I had zero programming experience and I literally mean it. ZERO! I was taught basic programming and algorithms for two years but couldn\u2019t find myself enjoying a lot because I was only theoretically understanding stuff without implementing it in real life. I started looking for various online courses & projects but not a lot of them were actually engaging so I ended up switching interests quite a few times. I tried to learn Robotics, Web-Development, Android Development etc., everything a typical college student would dream of learning. However, I couldn\u2019t find any of this much to my interest. I started watching Youtube for new technological videos and started researching about their applications. One day, I came across a video by Siraj Raval and that got me very excited about Machine Learning. I had heard about Machine Learning earlier but this time i dug in deeper, and I found the applications to be intriguing. I then decided to take the Udacity Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program in my summer break at the end of second year and that is where it all started.\n\nUdacity\u2019s nanodegrees programs are priced with a premium. However, they are absolutely worth every penny i spent! I had vacillated in deciding whether to pay for it or not and then I finally went ahead and took a calculated risk. I was not sure on how to convince my parents for it but I did somehow.\n\nAfter paying for the nanodegree Program, I was immediately enrolled and I was assigned a mentor. I was also asked to join the slack community where the other students and alums of the same nanodegree program discuss doubts and help each other. The videos are awesome and very coherent. The instructors are the world\u2019s best. You\u2019ll learn to go from the very basics to a great level having intuitive views about the topic that you\u2019re learning. Also, every concept has a quiz or programming assignment at the end which helps us to understand what we have learnt better. The nanodegree started with basic python programming and I built a movie trailer website using python. The next few modules talked about data science and statistics and I did projects on statistical hypothesis testing and analysing the titanic dataset. After making sure that the basics are lucid, machine learning was introduced and a regression project to predict Boston housing prices was given. Every project was reviewed after submission and the passing criteria was dependent on a particular rubric that was properly designed to take care of all the aspects. If the reviewers found the project below the satisfactory levels, I had to redo it and this time, make it better. This taught me about the industrial scenario of making things perfect and clean. The mentor helped me whenever I asked for help, and the slack community was awesome.\n\nThere were challenges I faced at every project I was given. Along the way, I learnt a very helpful skill \u2014 to google the right stuff. This is one skill which would take anyone a long way. Whenever I wanted to do something in my head and didn\u2019t know what exactly to do, I googled a lot and got familiar with a lot of other extra concepts that wasn\u2019t touched in the course. I invested around six to eight hours every week and was comfortably able to complete the course in the given timeline. Another thing that I was taught is to write clean code following the guidelines. Whenever I tried to escape with a quick fix and submit the project, my project reviewer held me and asked me to make changes in my project. This helped me to not escape but to actually research and learn.\n\nAt the end of the nanodegree program, my github profile was full of projects that I could show off. I updated my LinkedIn profile because I actually had something to show off. I added a few new skills and updated my profile. I built a sample resume using the google drive template. After all this, people started asking me general machine learning stuff at college and it felt great to answer them confidently. I felt motivated and went on to learn more about the field on youtube, using books and projects and most importantly, I began to understand terms that people used in ML. I also took various free courses after that which gave me a greater insight into ML. I then took the Deep Learning course at Udacity and it\u2019s going great for me."

        "title": "Udacity from a student\u2019s perspective \u2013 Udacity India \u2013",
        "text": "In the second half of 2017, I was looking for ways to upgrade my skill set. What the IT industry has taught me over the last 11 years is to constantly keep updating myself with latest trends and technologies to maintain employability & relevant. I was trying to find something that would be simple enough for me to start from scratch as well as complex enough to teach me skills to be able to solve real world scenarios and problems that I could face in the industry.\n\nIn recent years the rise of MOOCs has been phenomenal, offering learning material across multiple domains and discipline across geographies for a fraction of price. More importantly, owing to the enrolments in MOOCs the students also get to connect with peers across geographies and hence expand their professional networks. I have closely checked the courses in the top 3 MOOCs and looked into their course materials. I wanted to experience Machine Learning concepts and see whether I would like to continue with this as a career option.\n\nWhy I finally chose Udacity out of the top three is owing to these three distinct reasons:\n\n1) The introductory courses which act as pre-requisites for the main course (Machine Learning in my case) are very well explained and instils the concepts very clearly so that the same can be used in the future.\n\n2) The course material is easy to follow and the Udacity community is pretty big and extremely helpful (In form of Udacity Forums/Communities, Nanodegree channels in SLACK, blogposts in Medium etc.)\n\n3) If the above 2 points were not good enough to convince me to immediately enroll, the next point certainly did. A limited time offer was going on the Udacity India site, where the Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree was being offered for a big discount. Well, that was the final catalyst.\n\nThe overall experience over the last 2 months have been extremely wonderful. Although the courses are self-paced, there are tentative due dates for each module which always ensures that you are constantly in touch with the course material. Based on my experience, having worked on multiple programming languages in my career, the first module on Python programming passed on like a breeze. The reviews on project submission has been really helpful and the communities are awesome. However, the learning challenges started flowing in from the second and third modules when descriptive and inferential statistics knocked my door.\n\nI had previously studied statistics when I was in school. So, starting again with all these concepts packed up in one module initially seemed too much work! However, the instructors were really motivating and the videos were pretty well organised to ensure concepts are slowly built up. Also hands on exercises after every single module ensures that you clearly understand what you are learning. The initial phase quickly bore off after I started putting a little extra time and effort. Once the same was done, I felt really confident with what I had learned. Whenever I would see data in a spreadsheet, I would literally start planning in my mind the type of analysis that could potentially be performed. The really good aspect about the courses in Udacity is that you are expected to build up your concepts and be strong enough to face real world scenarios once you have obtained your Nanodegree.\n\nAnother question which I usually receive from my friends when they hear that I am enrolled in a Nanodegree program is whether the Nanodegree program really worth it. I bet a lot of you would have the same question.\n\nWell I cannot answer it simply as a Yes or No. Rather let me explain you a few points which should help in understanding the scenario.\n\n1) You get to list the Nanodegree in your profile in LinkedIn and your resume thereby highlighting the fact that you have been associated with an organisation and have completed certain assignments and gained specific knowledge on a specific skill set. For employers, a candidate that showcases skill set is lot more job worthy than those who don\u2019t.\n\n2) The Nanodegree Program keeps you motivated to complete your course once you have enrolled. Just like a conventional degree, completing the course will give you enormous satisfaction for the hard work. It will also give you the confidence to highlight your new skill set.\n\n3) Udacity provides a state of the art course material along with real world data sets and files for analysis. While you are working on the Nanodegree program, you can decide to showcase your findings in your blog/website and play around with the datasets and files to freely create/analyze something that you had not been asked to do in your course. This will not only help you to explore your skillset, highlighting the same in your blog/website will be an added advantage for highlighting your skills in the next job interview.\n\n4) The big multinational companies have started prioritising candidates with additional certifications & determine the competencies and skill sets of an associate. Hence a Nanodegree may allow you to switch career path within your current organisation itself.\n\n5) Last but not the least, the feedback that you receive from peers all around the world as well as mentors help in building your professional network as well as builds up your competency.\n\nSo, that\u2019s all I have for today. I hope you have enjoyed reading and I have been able to address some of your questions as well as provide an overview of a Udacity Nanodegree Program from a student\u2019s perspective."

        "text": "From Nothing to Something : A Udacity Story\n\nLearning how to code can be intimidating. But, learning how to build a complete application from scratch is more intimidating than facing Lord Voldemort (OK, yeah I\u2019m exaggerating a bit). And by the end of my second year as a computer science undergraduate, I was in the same scary place that you are in right now(I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re too looking forward to learn how to build apps). I knew how to code, but I had no clue how full-scale applications are built. And I wanted to learn how to go from an idea of a web application to a fully deployed app on the Internet. And so, I enrolled at Hogwarts! Umm\u2026Okay, I enrolled in a Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree Program.\n\nSo, this story has 3 parts:\n\nSo I hope your pizza is ready because I\u2019m going to start blabbering now.\n\nWell, it all started with a good old-fashioned Google search. And Voila! There were way too many websites that wanted to teach me how to code and how to build applications. So I started going through all the websites and their offerings, prices, reviews and all else that you go through before diving into something. And after a lot of Sherlock-ing, I finally ended up at Udacity\u2019s homepage. It had plenty of options, from Android to iOS to Web to VR, it had it all. The course\u2019s syllabus seemed good, the instructors looked like they knew what they were doing, Sebastian Thrun(The founder of Udacity) definitely looked like someone who knows what he\u2019s doing. And so with all that, I decided to enroll in the Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree Program and, unlike the Star Wars prequels, it was actually great.\n\nThe Nanodegree that Udacity offers is much more than just a course. It is a lifetime access to Udacity\u2019s various resources and opportunities that keep helping you along the road. The course is just the main course, but there are many sides and dessert too.\n\nNow first, the boring part. What exactly did I learn?\n\nThe Nanodegree started with teaching Python. It doesn\u2019t go in-depth but dabbled into the constructs of the language, enough to get me started. Then it moved onto teaching me HTML and CSS and all the intricacies of developing the front-end of a web application. After that, it taught me how to build the back-end of a web application using Python and Google App Engine, eventually deploying it to the cloud. Then, we moved onto learning how to develop a complete web application in Flask (A Python Framework), along with working with databases(Postgresql and SQLite), and how to integrate the front-end and the back-end of a web application together. After this, I moved onto creating a complete front-end application using JavaScript and Knockout JS. And the course concluded with me learning how to set up an Amazon EC2 instance to deploy my application and serve it to users.\n\nSo what was so interesting about this?\n\nThe interesting part was that by the end of it I had about 4 complete projects that I could put on my Github and my resume. This is because Udacity focuses on a learning-by-doing approach. So, I ended up watching videos and reading articles and blogs about topics. And then I was supposed to create a project and submit it, which was then reviewed by a human reviewer and I needed to pass the review in order to complete it. If I failed a review (which I did a lot), the reviewer provided a complete analysis of the project and what I needed to improve and why.\n\nAlong with this, it also had mini-courses on git, algorithms and data structures, and a few more which I forgot, sadly. So, by the end of the course, I felt confident that I could work at a tech company as a developer without feeling like a total noob.\n\nIn dessert, the Nanodegree provided various courses on creating my Github profile, Linkedin profile, Udacity\u2019s profile and resume. And as a topping, it also provided reviews of those profiles by a professional Udacity reviewer who told me what my profile was lacking or in some cases, like Han Solo, how cool it was.\n\nOnce the Nanodegree was complete, I got a cool digital certificate and my access to my course content remains open even until now. But more interestingly, I still am a part of Udacity\u2019s alumni network on Linkedin and Slack, and Udacity still keeps on providing me access to various resources and opportunities that help me (or could help me in the potential future) in getting my foot in the tech arena.\n\nReally? After all that, you still have that question? Of course, it was useful and I had a lot of fun learning with Udacity and it\u2019s super cool instructors. So what happened next? Well, I ended up getting a software engineering internship at a startup in Bangalore, India and all thanks to the projects I created during this Nanodegree. But more importantly, it gave me the confidence that I could also be a web developer/ software engineer and I can learn it all on the Internet.\n\nSo yes, learning how to code and build applications is super intimidating but with the right resources that are available on the Internet, I feel if you really want to learn, then you can learn it and become legendary at it."

        "text": "As with any machine learning exercise, we first need to gather our data on which we will train the model. The simulator images look something like this:\n\nWhile the actual images from the track look something like this:\n\nThe next step is to manually annotate the images for the network. There are many open source tools available for this like LabelImg, Sloth, etc. The annotation tools create a yaml file that looks something like this:\n\nThis step was the most time consuming of all. When I started, it took me almost 3 hours to understand the working of the tools, install the dependencies and then annotate the simulator data-set. Luckily, one of the main advantages of the Nano-degree is the immense amount of support that you get from discussion with your peers from around the world. One of my peers, Anthony Sarkis has graciously made his annotated data-set openly available for all to use. Thank you Anthony Sarkis for this :)\n\nFor training the model with the API, we first need to convert our data into the TFRecord format. This format basically takes your images and the yaml file of annotations and combines them into one that can be given as input for training. The starter code is provided on the tensorflow\u2019s Github page.\n\nNext we need to setup an object detection pipeline. TensorFlow team also provides sample config files on their repo. For my training, I used two models, ssd_inception_v2_coco and faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco. These models can be downloaded from here.\n\nI needed to adjust the to 4 and also set the path ( ) for the model checkpoint, the train and test data files as well as the label map. I also reduced the number of region proposals from the author\u2019s original suggestion of 300, to 10 for faster_rcnn and from 100 to 50 for ssd_inception. In terms of other configurations like the learning rate, batch size and many more, I used their default settings. (Note: the must be less than or equal to the so I reduced that to 10 as well for faster_rcnn else it will throw an error.)\n\nNote: The is very interesting if your dataset doesn\u2019t have much of variability like different scale, pose etc. A full list of options can be found here (see ).\n\nWe also need to create a label map for each class. Example of how to create label maps can be found here. For my case it looked something like this:\n\nSo in the end, we need the following things before going to the next step:\n\nNext steps are pretty straightforward. You need access to a GPU for training. I used the AWS p2.xlarge with the udacity-carnd-advanced-deep-learning AMI which has all the dependencies like TensorFlow and Anaconda installed. I trained in total 4 different models \u2014 two models with faster-rcnn (one each for simulator images and real images) and two with ssd_inception.\n\nThe output of the model inference looks something like this:"

        "text": "Nanodegree? Udacity? That\u2019s the one! For those of you who aren\u2019t aware of term Nanodegree, it\u2019s a credential which you can earn by enrolling for a course of your choice offered by Udacity. As a beginner, I enrolled for Data Analyst Nanodegree Program and, currently wrapping up Advanced Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.\n\nI am a firm believer of lifelong learning \u2014 being proactive to learn new skills. Also, it was a great experience to watch some of the freely available content. This eventually led to admiration for the way Udacity strived to teach any concept in an engaging and fun manner.\n\nAs most of us know, Data Analytics and Machine Learning is important for many reasons but I had an interest for this field which I had picked up intuitively. There will be rise of data, and hence Machine Learning Applications is an useful skill to learn.\n\nThe course design played an important role because that gave me a first impression of what my learning experience will look like. Multiple instructors experts in their varied backgrounds yet complimenting each other, and the course as a whole \u2014 helped me understand the broad context of Machine Learning. The quizzes helped me gain confidence and completing the projects gave me a sense of confidence.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Data Wrangling module which involved wrangling of Open Street Map Data. You can check my work here. My love for details was discovered while I immersed myself in this process. Wrangling is all about getting the data right as the sources of data are mostly not consistent. It requires attention to detail within the data. A few other experiences included Data Visualisation using D3.js which is a great tool to create interactive viz stuff. Challenging yet fun \u2014 Spotting fraud at Enron using their email datasets(simulated), gave me great insights. :-D. TensorFlow and Deep Learning by Vincent Vanhoucke was wonderful!\n\nAll of this wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the unsung heroes \u2014 The Project Reviewers! Yes, Udacity reviews your work based on certain rubrics and sometimes I had to make submissions as many as 5 (or 6) times for the same project! The constructive feedback from the reviewers helped me to think and made the learning process better.\n\nI am an undergrad. Though my typical academic life should allow me some space to work on extra-curricular activities, it\u2019s tough to keep up the pace of completing the projects and courses on time if the motivation levels are low. Sometimes, the priorities change while making decisions to dedicate time on your career. But when I used to get the deadline notification \u2014 that\u2019s when the \u201cpanic monster\u201d in me aggravated to finish up the projects and capstone.\n\nThe projects isn\u2019t just about writing successful code. It\u2019s also about documenting the work I have done. I repeat, a lot of writing to explain your output of your work. However, the \u201cpanic monster\u201d might lead you to do things in a wrong way. Yes, I am talking about plagiarism. There were three cases (I remember all the bad things I do :-P ) when I was clueless about the tasks and I admit having copied from sources to write very long reports because I only had short amount of time. Is it ok to do that? Definitely not! It\u2019s extremely important to be disciplined to complete the Nanodegree. I learnt my lesson the hard way!\n\nThis unique learning experience gave me the necessary skills I had desired to acquire. It\u2019s like a toolkit in your brain to start experimenting and building things related to Machine Learning. I worked for DataKind as a Pro Bono volunteer in one of their weekend events. Applied these skills in many of my undergrad projects as well.\n\nI also had an opportunity to interact with some of the hiring partners from Udacity Propel. It\u2019s a platform to showcase your Nanodegree work and select companies hire you if you are a compatible player."

        "text": "Prior to proactively making informed career decision of becoming an Android Developer, I was an automation test engineer using selenium in a web application at Infosys. It was a nice settling job, however I wanted something more in my life. So I started looking around and decided to become an Android Developer. A few months later, at present I am a software developer at Infosys and I work on mobile application development using native android and react native. I\u2019m a Google certified Associate Android Developer and I\u2019m extremely passionate about my work. But I have decided that my learning won\u2019t stop here. I have interest in Machine Learning and I have started another coursework in the same. Further, once I have a solid machine learning background to support my career as a Machine Learning researcher, I am planning to apply for MS in Machine Learning at KTH/Aalto University and I wish to pursue a research career in Convolutional Neural Networks.\n\nI would like to share with you that I am Google certified alumni & a member at GDG-Chennai. I have attended Google India Certification Summit, GDD India 2017. The reason I am sharing this with you is because I want to tell you how significant being in these communities was for me to take my step ahead towards my dream career. These people share mindsets similar to mine and have helped me reach new heights in my career. Most importantly I would like to tell you that I\u2019m a part of all of these communities because my learning curve increased exponentially after i enrolled with Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree Programs! Apart from teaching me how to learn and implement things, they taught me how to learn everything quickly, efficiently, and in a community of learners my quality of learning was at its best! The Quality of education provided by Udacity is priceless as compared to the other platforms. Udacity\u2019s community, project evaluation & feedback team and Udacity Propel \u2014 their offline flagship job fair- has done an excellent job so far. The reason I say this is because I was taught by some of the finest android developers around the world including Dan Galphin, Katherine Kaun and Lyla Fujiwara. The features that set Udacity apart from others is their coursework, lectures, multiple \u2014 practical project submissions and their personalised project feedbacks. Apart from the nanodegree courses, I also learned Git, Linear Algebra etc. from Udacity.\n\nI had once read an article featuring Peeyush Ranjan CTO of Flipkart where he spoke about \u201cInterview-less Hiring\u201d. I was extremely impressed by the idea back then. I used to wonder, how would that feel, and if i would ever get a chance to experience that elite process of interview-less hirings!\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only thing I had fantasised about. During my nanodegree courses I also dreamt of meeting the people who working with technology giants like Google. But today, Thanks to Udacity\u2019s Google developers program, I have a photograph with Dan Galphin! I currently have 2 offers in hand, one from Commutatus at Udacity Propel for the position of React Native Developer and another from Olam International. Thanks to Udacity\u2019s Propel event! I also got to experience the interview-less hiring process! Joining Udacity makes you a part of this Elite Learners Club where you get the best of everything!\n\nYou should certainly go ahead and start your learning journey with Udacity today!"

There is a plethora of career options, and free online courses available, to pursue. But the ultimate challenge is to pick the right option out of the hundred feasible ones. It took me months before I could finally put my finger on Machine Learning(ML) as a potential direction that seems to be logical and also has a bright future. Since the apps are also getting smarter along with the phones, machine learning is becoming a requirement that all developers need to be skilled at. After identifying \u201cwhat\u201d now began the next phase of identifying \u201chow\u201d of the upskilling process \u2014 Finding the right place to learn and develop my ML skills. I am sure you would have had come across a hundreds of paid and free courses available online. And just like everybody else, I also dipped my toes in some of the free courses. I saw some youtube videos, searched through some Github repositories and took my sweet time to understand it better. But the reality is that they hold little credibility in the job market. So after another month or two i realised that I\u2019ll need to find a better & more credible place to upskill and become visible in the market to get employed. Since I am from Gujarat, it was difficult for me to locate a good offline training institute to learn Machine Learning, hence online platforms were my best bets!\n\nMost of the paid courses have similar offerings so it became difficult to choose one. Until I came across Udacity\u2019s platform. I took some free foundation courses to experience their content structure. I soon realised that they were offering far more than just recorded online courses! I enrolled quickly after they told me that they offer one on one mentoring to each student, and they respond back with the assignment review in just 48 hours \u2014 sometimes as short as 6 hours \u2014 which is unmatchable! I realised that I was the one who could decide the pace of the course as per my ability to learn. I decided to join Udacity\u2019s paid Nanodegree Programs. I found three Machine Learning courses out of which I chose the one with the live projects that interested me the most.\n\nI took Udacity\u2019s Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree program. My mentor certainly being the best part about the program since he proactively kept me updated with the weekly news related to ML and providing constant guidance for my project submissions, providing additional feedback on how to make my code better. I till this day can\u2019t express my gratitude to the mentor that was assigned to me with this course. He has inspired me everyday, until the the end of the course, and is the main reason why I was able to successfully complete the course by exceeding my own expectations of me. Apart from the mentorship, I also appreciate Udacity\u2019s online slack community \u2014 an online discussion forum \u2014 which had dedicated channel for each project. This is important for in depth learning and topics don\u2019t get mixed up. Also I could learn what other coders across India were thinking while approaching a problem, and I realised that there are so many perspectives to a single line of code! Whenever there was an instance of me getting stuck in a project or assignment, I conveniently spent time skimming through the discussions we had in the online slack channels and have almost always found a solution overnight. In case I still had a doubt, I knew talking to my mentor is always an option. Learning became extremely convenient with Udacity\u2019s learning channels.\n\nI always thought that offline classrooms are better than the online classrooms, however Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree programs has absolutely flipped my belief. Instead I found these classrooms to be more connected. I could comfortably interact with my teachers and mentors anytime, sitting in Gujarat, geography is no long a barrier to access quality teachers! The slack community kept me engaged, and interacting with the people who have similar goal, are knowledgeable helps me to keep my motivation levels high.\n\nI would any day recommend learning online with Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree Programs to the ones who are confused about choosing the right place to learn and connect with a community of inspiring lifelong learners!"

        "title": "How Machine Learning/Data Science/AI is going to revolutionise marketing in future?",
        "text": "With the advent of big data, opportunities for artificial intelligence to revolutionise marketing is growing on day by day. Artificial intelligence technologies are now used to transform every aspect of marketing. Right from the beginning of the marketing process itself till the customer engagement. AI can build a website for the marketers at much less time and cost than a team of developers would take to complete the project. Another area that AI can disrupt is the content creation in marketing process. Tools like ThingLink and Articoolo are already in use by many media houses to create clickable news content. These content creation tools use built in templates and keywords to create content which resembles the content created by the humans. Not only these, artificial intelligence is also used in customer engagement by many big brands. Netflix and Amazon use artificial intelligence to recommend movies and products and keep customers engaged.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the consumer behaviour in marketing, artificial intelligence systems like IBM Watson can analyse behaviour of the customers from their past shopping/buying data and can provide personalized recommendations to them. For example, companies like The North Face using IBM Watson to drive what they call it as cognitive retail to find the perfect fit for the customers need. Artificial intelligence has also been used by marketers to study how customers search for brands online and thereby creating and optimizing content to drive better marketing campaign. Google\u2019s AI advances like voice search and RankBrain has revolutionized the search engine optimization. Not only Google, Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri, Amazon Echo are few examples which had made it easier for customers to search online. These new AI technologies has changed the way customers search online and marketers now need to adapt to these new technologies to understand customer demand. Another area artificial intelligence has disrupted is the customer personalization. The above-mentioned AI technologies has completely automated the customer segmentation for the marketers. Now the marketers can target those customers by sending content relevant to each customers lifestyle. At last go for brand positioning by engaging them more and prompt them make a purchase again and again.\n\nAnother area which revolutionizing marketing is the combination social media and artificial intelligence. Today billions of people are connected through social media which marketers can tap to capitalize their marketing campaigns. In all of these social media platforms customers can customize their preferences on what content they want to see or what they care for and this provides marketers the audience insights to target relevant content for their audiences. The other disruption by artificial intelligence in marketing is the advertisements. AI is now driving the automated bidding systems to purchase keywords in Google AdWords. Marketers can automatically bid for the lowest possible CPC to capture traffic from Google results.\n\nLastly, I will talk about the chatbots, where AI is setting new marketing avenues for the marketers. Many brands are now using chatbots to connect with their customers. Customers can ask about different industries, brands or different offerings of the same brand (as in assistant bots). Not only that, AI powered customer service chatbots are also in use now by many organizations to create a better customer engagement."

        "title": "How Machine Learning can help in retaining customers by targeted marketing?",
        "text": "I always believe an engaged customer is a retained customer, and engagement, much like entertainment, is the means to grab and retain someone\u2019s attention. The basic rule we are taught in business development and customer relationship management is to build trust. The more a customer trusts you the more they will give their business to you over your competitors. It\u2019s important to understand though what trust means in the context of a relationship between a service provider and a client/customer, and how trust can be built via targeted marketing.\n\nIn the industry that I work in, which is patent and market research services, the customers come from diverse industry backgrounds. They work with service providers and consultants to keep a tab on their industry, their competitors, and their customers, and they outsource their research studies to these companies \u2014 which is the business model. In some cases, the customers work with many different service providers and then circle-down on a specific one depending on their experience with the company. While this experience depends on many factors such as the price of the service, the quality of the output, and other performance-related criteria, it also depends on the relationship the customer has with the point-of-contact in the company, and how much they trust the relationship. It isn\u2019t uncommon for customers to work with a company in spite of the existence of low-cost options from competitors, just because of the relationship.\n\nOne way to build trust by keeping customers engaged is doing something for them when it isn\u2019t asked for. This can be, for example, sharing a snippet of something interesting happening in their industry along with your own insights (instead of just facts). It\u2019s important in this case that you are the first one to share that snippet, and it is relevant for the customer. This is a clever way on maintaining the relationship and also a subtle marketing tool to showcase your research and insight generation capabilities.\n\nSometimes, though, using traditional methods, this is easier said than done. When you have many customers, catering to them individually for finding these interesting snippets is time-consuming and sharing general snippets for every customer based on just their industry will probably not be too relevant.\n\nIt may also happen that customers from different industries are interested in the same area (automotive customers and power tools customers can both be interested in developments happening in higher energy density batteries, for example) or that customers from the same industry might be interested in two very different areas (one customer from automotive might be interested in batteries and the other in fuel-cells).\n\nSo, how do you effectively segment your customers based on their historical assignments to you, their industry, their department details, the product groups they handle, and so on? Since there can be many input characteristics for defining a customer\u2019s potential interest area, this problem is much better solved by Machine learning algorithms, specifically the algorithms that enable unsupervised clustering.\n\nWhat these Machine learning techniques will do is they will take all the input elements describing your customers as \u2018features\u2019 and they will help in segmenting the customers who have closest features in multiple groups or clusters. This will be done without any input from you on what cluster you want to have and hence will be unsupervised.\n\nAn example of this can be where you describe each customer with the following features:\n\nIn this case, the customers from different industries who have given assignments in similar or the same technology area might end up in the same cluster enabling you to get a common snippet with something interesting for them created.\n\nSimilarly, if you take customers from two different industries with a common location of interest, you can create a common snippet for them which provides interesting information on their common location of interest and save time.\n\nOnce you have a tuned machine learning model, and you get these clusters, you can then identify internal teams to do some quick research for finding interesting snippets to share with each cluster.\n\nThis way the task of finding the customer clusters will be optimised, and it will be easier for you to generate relevant snippets faster."

        "text": "I\u2019m a college dropout and a Software Engineer. I chose to study Telecommunication Engineering in my second year of college. However, unfortunately I couldn\u2019t make sense of what I studied and inevitable it reflected badly on my grades as well. I soon realised that maybe my decision to become a telecommunication engineer isn\u2019t the best of the decisions I had made lately. So I eventually decided to drop out of the college. Like the majority students of my age I was absolutely clueless about making career decisions. While I was in my reflective phase one day, I was wondering how I would put my current situation in a software code I had learnt when I was in my high school. And that was the aha moment of my life when I realised the joy and excitement i felt in my High School computer science classes. I still remembering getting goosebumps when I had executed my first \u201cHello World\u201d program in C language. Back then coding had amazed me, but I had no clue about the world of career opportunities it beholds. Wasting no further time, I started connecting the dots and decided that I want to become a Software Engineer. I knew I will have to start from the scratch and surprisingly it didn\u2019t scare me! I started learning online on my own with no one to guide or mentor me. More power to the internet! It has so much more power than we realise & it played a significant role in pushing me forward. The next obvious step was to find a credible space to start learning and earning degrees, and once I found Udacity, I knew this is the best place for me. So I enrolled in the Nanodegree program.\n\nUdacity is the place where I immersed myself in learning. With a lot of free courses covering different domains, preceded the Nanodegree programs for me. This enabled me to pursue the degrees ,of which I had no prior background from scratch, without going elsewhere. All of their courses are structured, which make them student friendly and convenient. I have benefitted the most out of Udacity\u2019s code review of the project assignments I have submitted. Since they were detailed, they taught me more about my thinking process while I code Vs. the best/alternative ways to write it to eventually improve.\n\nI think Udacity is the best place to learn technology and I have seen this for myself. I am also sure about this since I started learning with Udacity when I had no Job & I was exploring places to learning online. At the beginning I had no clear path or a guiding mentor. However everything flipped once I enrolled with Udacity\u2019s React Nanodegree Program. I got stark clarity about the further learning steps and got a mentor who helped me in following best practices to write code.\n\nAfter successfully completing my React Nanodegree Program, I updated my Linkedin profile & following that attended Udacity\u2019s Propel event \u2014 Udacity\u2019s Job fair- held in bangalore. Thanks to Udacity\u2019s Propel Event I am now a Full time Software Developer.\n\nAt Udacity apart from learning how to code, I have also learnt that learning should never start. I have hence after completing my React Nanodegree program, I\u2019m now enrolled in Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree program. In IT change is the only constant, hence constantly upskilling is the only way ahead to a bright promising career!"

I have a Bachelors in Management Studies Degree and before completing Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree in Android Development , I worked as a Finance Manager / Head Audio Engineer for an artist management company. I have been trying to switch to the Programming field for a while. I really got interested in programming when I stumbled upon Linux while browsing through the internet. I couldn\u2019t stop falling down that rabbit hole once I started to learn all that there was about Linux. I soon realised that I finally knew what I wanted to further my career in.\n\nSince I had absolutely zero programming background, I realised that I had to start from ground zero. To be able to pick up Udacity\u2019s android development \u2014 1 Nanodegree Program, I had to first learn coding in C & java. Udacity is amazingly planned about designing courses, since they had designed a FREE Foundation Android Development course for students like me who are curious to learn but have no coding background. So I picked up the free course which took me just 4 weeks to complete. Taking up this course was great since this helped me reinforce my interest in the android development field, and I could learn the basics for absolutely free! I know that there are other free courses available on the internet, however I found this course better structured. It was bound to happen since it was curated in association with Google! So in case you are wondering where to start, start right here, with this FREE Foundation Android Development Course by Udacity.\n\nUdacity is the one of the most connected online technical learning platform I have come across. They have courses designed & certified by the Industry leaders unlike the zillion other platforms. The choice was easy! Coming from the standard style of educational institutions, I enjoyed the fact that the course is completely practical and not biased towards teaching just the theory. The most important part of taking Android Development course is that they trained me to be completely job ready. Since they are working directly with the leading silicon valley recruiters, Udacity\u2019s mentors effortlessly trained me, inculcating the industrial overview along with the technical courses. This is their priceless offering that no other competitor is offering!\n\nMy priority goal is to start off as an android programmer, but I will continue to upskill myself and expanding my knowledge base. I am planning to take up machine learning, IOS Dev, etc later as i progress in my career. Since Udacity\u2019s goal of lifelong learning resonated with my long term goal of doing something I love for the rest of my life, upskilling is the only way forward!"

However, I also had active interest in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Robotics.\n\nI am currently in Term 2 of this program. Prior to this program, I had enrolled in Computer Vision Program and Reinforcement Learning courses in Udacity. These programs have helped me transition to my dream role of being a Computer Vision/Deep Learning Engineer.\n\nI have done courses in other platforms as well but what sets Udacity apart from others is that the Nanodegree programs have very strong industry focus. Curriculum is truly world-class and taught by the best in the business. Some of the modules are taught by the Industry leaders and engineers who have developed the technology/product (for e.g., some of the modules in Term 2 of Self Driving car program are taught by Mercedez Benz team).

        "text": "I am an avid learner & love keeping tabs on the latest technology trends. Before enrolling for Udacity\u2019s Frontend Developer Nanodegree program, I was pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University(GGSIPU). After my regular engineering degree, like the most engineer graduates, I got successfully placed in an IT firm. I worked there as a software development intern. It was a great kick start to my career since there, I got my first-hand experience of a startup culture and real-world problem solving which motivated me to expand my skill set. During this I realised my capability to be able to make bigger contributions to a product based company.\n\nAfter choosing to pursue my dreams with Udacity, I graduated from the Frontend Developer Nanodegree Program in June 2017. This successfully laid the foundation for my dream career that I am currently pursuing. Thanks to Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree, as it played a huge role in helping me achieve my goals.\n\nI can\u2019t start to explain how impressed I am by the coursework content. Pursuing the nanodegree program eventually ignited my interest in solving real-world problems. Adding to the amazing course structure is the flexibility to download all the video lectures, which I used to watch offline while travelling. This helped me to maximise my learning time & learn on the go.\n\nThere were various project submissions as a part of my coursework and udacity\u2019s academic team provided the feedback to each of my assignment I submitted which is worth mentioning. The feedback on each submission was extremely personalised and sharp.\n\nOnce i joined the nanodegree program, I was promptly added to a social online degree specific slack groups along with other enrolled students and the most importantly \u2014 Mentors. All my mentors were just a text away! This helped me in building close-knit communities, as i connected with everyone interested in the same domain. It helped me in discussing challenges & difficult topics with the rest of the students while studying.\n\nThe most crucial part that allowed me to finish the degree successfully was Udacity Propel, the flagship career fair. They were organized by Udacity and provided me a platform to interact with like-minded people and helped me in understanding the upcoming industry trends. I strongly feel that the communities I happen to become a part of, played a crucial role in my journey with Udacity.\n\nMy learning experience at Udacity was amazing, and would certainly recommend Udacity\u2019s Frontend Developer Nanodegree."

        "text": "I am an entrepreneur and am currently working towards upskilling myself by doing various small-medium size web development projects.\n\nIn my 2nd year college - SRM University Sonipat- I was assigned a project that was relatively difficult as compared to the ones I had done before.I soon realised that this project will add a lot of value to my profile, however I did not have the skill or the confidence to be able to work on that project alone. This situation lead me to the realise the necessity of pursuing a professional course to upskill my skill set and gain confidence. When I started looking for the right platform, I came across Udacity and was convinced about starting my journey of becoming a confident Developer with Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree Programs.\n\nOne predominant thing that I really like about Udacity over the other platforms is quality of videos & that they are brief. This helps, since short videos keep me engaged while viewing the course content, making the course modules just perfect.\n\nI ended up enrolling in React Nanodegree & AI Foundations Nanodegree after successfully earning my Front End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity. This is because there is always something new to learn & look forward to with every module of Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree programs. Keeping in mind the future goals, I enrolled in Udacity\u2019s AI Foundations Nanodegree. I had previously done a small chatbot project using Google Assistant and starting there, I got extremely fascinated with the immense potential AI beholds. So taking up AI was the next inevitable step.\n\nUdacity Community is a closely knit group of like minded individuals. The community vied the Slack groups, Meetups, Propel have not only kept me engaged but also has given me an opportunity to interact with people from all walks of life, to learn from their journey of becoming a ND graduate.\n\nUdacity\u2019s online Community is very unique, unlike any other MOOC platform, where no quality connect with the other graduates is formed online. Being a fresher, it\u2019s difficult to point out a right career option without proper guidance. These courses however, taught me what Universities lack- the practical exposure- and moreover they taught me the old school tools. Since the technological developments are extremely fast paced, it becomes really difficult to keep up. Hence one of the major reasons behind choosing Udacity was that they offer career guidance throughout the course and job opportunities at the end of the course with top tier companies.\n\nAt the end of my first course i felt more employable. I am saying this because when I attended Udacity\u2019s offline career fair \u2014 Propel X, employers showed great interest in my profile and I was surprised! Being a fresher, yet receiving quality offers from recruiters such as Reliance Jio, Engineer.AI, Nobroker, Rentomojo ; speaks for itself. It definitely proved to me how through simple videos, Udacity\u2019s Career team had successfully helped me improve my personality and profile simultaneously.\n\nKnow more about Front End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity Here!"

        "text": "Stories that re-affirm the importance of lifelong learning,\n\nStories that make our belief stronger in what we do everyday!\n\nEvery success story is special in their own way. These stories come in all shapes and sizes. For some of the stories, it is about students coming out of their comfort zone and finding a new career path. For other stories, it is about the students learning new things and getting a dream job. These stories are bound to renew your belief in learning with the sheer grit and courage that the students have shown to change their destiny and be what they always wanted to be. We are overwhelmed to be a part of their journey.\n\nA throwback of some of the best stories we have come across this year:\n\nAyan\u2019s story is not something you will come across every day. It takes courage to do what he has done and become what he is today. After some unforeseen circumstances in the family, Ayan had to drop out from his school to support his family. From his little knowledge of Java programming, he started looking for courses in Android Development online. With great determination and support from his extended family, Ayan finished his Android Developer Nanodegree. He is currently working on West Bengal government\u2019s health project and pursuing Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about Udacity:\n\n\u201cI am 17 years old now and am the one who develops and creates all Apps used by Facilitators of West Bengal Government. Udacity made this possible\u201d. I feel proud when I think of my life as a normal school student a year ago and now am a professional Android Developer also a web developer and presently studying Machine Learning from Udacity only.\u201d\n\nJimit\u2019s father is a mechanic with a small shop in Ahmedabad. Growing up, Jimit\u2019s family always assumed he\u2019d follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. But, Jimit had other plans and always loved to code. After completing his 6-month training to become a mechanic \u2014 he asked his father if he could take some time to pursue his real dreams of becoming a developer. His father agreed to give him 12 months. The journey that Jimit undertook after that, could easily inspire a movie\n\nWith absolute no money to go for formal education, and very few opportunities to pursue his dream, Jimit found his calling through Udacity. Jimit travelled miles every day to use the free wi-fi at Kakaria lake in Ahmedabad & connect to Udacity. He sat on the footpath you see here, where the signal was the strongest, and began taking Android free courses through Udacity. After he completed this training, he began applying for jobs as a professional developer and today, Jimit supports his family with the salary he is earning as a developer.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about his experience \u201cI started my android development journey with Udacity. Given the resources I had, Udacity free courses was a blessing to me. What I really liked about Udacity is their industry-relevant content and hands-on project. The content is much relevant to what\u2019s needed by the industry. We\u2019re taught by expert instructors from Google who are working in this field since inception. I would really like to thank Udacity for everything that I have achieved till now.\u201d\n\nComing from tier \u2014 2 engineering college, Vaibhav Singh had to face multiple difficulties skilling himself in Mobile development field. While he was looking for a course which can help build his foundations strong, he came across Udacity Nanodegree Programs. After learning the basics of Android, he took up Android Developer Nanodegree which helped him further grow his skills in Android Development. Currently, he is working on two projects \u2014 one of them is creating a Conference App for ICHSA 2018\n\nIn his own words, \u201cI learned so much from my instructors, mentors (people you actually interact with the most) and Udacity forums (an amazing place where you can share your learning; get help from others). When you regularly interact with your peer group, reading their code and getting them to debug your code, your learning curve is bound to speed up.\u201d\n\nShantanu came across Data Analysis field, when it was introduced as an elective in his college. He was amazed with the role data plays in the important decision-making process. A research on an online course which would provide him in-depth knowledge of essential data analytics field led him to Udacity. His Nanodegree experience helped him to win hackathon which now holds a Guinness World Record of the biggest hackathon. He also published an International research paper on detecting fraud news on social media.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about Udacity- \u201cThe Nanodegree provided the complete learning path and structure that every student would need during this AI and Data Science boom. The courses were lined up and ordered in such a way that it would help anyone who is new to the field to understand which field to explore first. The projects are tailored to industry needs so you never feel that you\u2019re learning something that might go to waste.\u201d\n\nMariam Fatima holds a Masters degree in Geography and Bachelors in Education. In her previous avatar, she was a middle school Social Science teacher. Her interest in web development bloomed when she shifted to the \u2018Silicon Valley of India\u2019. She wanted to build websites on her own. After a few initial research on a full-fledged online course, she came across Udacity\u2019s Front-End Developer Nanodegree. As a Nanodegree student, she got a chance to participate in Propel and she did it \u2014 Her first internship as a Front-end Developer :)\n\nHere\u2019s how she describes her journey, \u201cFor someone like me, who is changing career paths, Udacity was quite helpful. It seems to have a passion to provide support and encouragement to people from varied backgrounds.\u201d\n\nComing from a commerce background, the magic binary numbers were always fascinating to Amen. The idea of being able to build something from scratch that could help or entertain millions & billions of people around the world was an ultimate motivation. He started his Udacity journey with a couple of free courses in Android development and then turned to Android Developer Nanodegree. Currently, he is further working on enhancing his skills as a developer and has an android application published on Google Play Store with around 18K downloads.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said \u201cA few weeks ago, I would have never imagined that I\u2019ll ever be able to design or create something of my own by coding, but I did that, and did it well. Thanks to Udacity!\u201d\n\nRohan\u2019s passion for software development started back in childhood days. Watching his father work on laptops and coding, he always aspired to become one. As a member of Google Developers Group, he received an invitation to join Google Udacity Scholarship. And, life took a turn! The Android Developer Nanodegree helped him polish his skills as an Android Developer. The best part \u2014 He received 4 job offers in Udacity Propel early this year.\n\nIn his own words, \u201cUdacity\u2019s courses are laid out brilliantly. Their video content has actual people talking to you, and not just screencasts of an IDE is what made me trust Udacity. The lectures are so interactive that it feels like a connection just like that of an actual classroom. The Android course creators at Udacity are developer advocates from Google itself and their content certainly shows the amount of research they have put into 2 things:\n\n1. What a student wants when he\u2019s learning\n\n2. What the IT industry wants from developers\u201d\n\nBuilding automated and smart solutions to solve day-to-day problems was always a passion for Sarvaswa. He started his journey in automation back in college days with courses in robotics and embedded systems. He turned to Udacity to develop his skills in computer vision and Artificial Intelligence. After building up the foundation in advanced Machine learning concepts & Deep learning algorithms, he enrolled into Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. A strong background and Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree made him a spotlight at Propel. Currently, he is working as AI and Machine Learning Ninja at Engineer.ai.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about Udacity \u201cComing from a non-Computer Science background it is difficult to become a part of a fast-growing and highly competitive industry such as AI. Learning the core concepts of a new industry and implementing them helps a lot in building a good resume for that industry. All the interviews that I was able to qualify were because of my work and the projects that I have done.\u201d\n\nAbhishek is a researcher, published novelist, linguist, and social sciences enthusiast. While talking to Machine Learning expert, Abhishek was fascinated with the fact how technologies could be applied creatively and in designing applications. And, that\u2019s when he decided to learn more about data analytics. He started with Udacity\u2019s beginner courses to build his basic knowledge in data analytics and then turned to Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. He transitioned from being a \u2018Technical Administrator\u2019 to a \u2018Data Specialist\u2019 within the same NGO and is helping middle schools in Bihar to generate actionable insights on students\u2019 engagement with the school.\n\nIn his words \u201cBack in 2014, when I first stumbled on Udacity, there weren\u2019t as many players in the data science education field as you see today. While many courses were teaching programming languages through game design, I liked how grounded Udacity\u2019s courses and exercises were in real-world data. \u201d\n\nShivanand is an electrical engineering graduate from IIT Roorkee and an MBA graduate from Essex Business School. After working in Oracle for about two years, he decided to become an entrepreneur. It was during his entrepreneurship that he felt a strong need of top level understanding of data driven approach, and enrolled in Business Analyst Nanodegree Program. He then moved to advanced technologies with Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Currently, he is working in Wipro Digital as a software architect.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say about Udacity \u201cThe theoretical concepts could be entirely different from real life applications, the Nanodegrees at Udacity mainly in focus with the industry perspective and the real life application of technologies. In other words, it\u2019s tailored for the acquiring the skill sets you might need every day.\u201d\n\nInspired to start your success story, Start learning today with Udacity!"

        "title": "From political science and economics researcher to a programmer \u2014 Career Transition with Udacity",
        "text": "I am a researcher, published novelist, linguist and social sciences enthusiast who loves to combine the worlds of the quantitative and qualitative for novel insights. I have worked primarily in the development sector for the poor and underprivileged across a range of organizations- the Reserve Bank of India, the Harvard Kennedy School, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation and most recently, at QUEST Alliance. In all these roles and during my studies at the University of London, I have been harnessing economics and data analysis for improved interventions in education, financial inclusion and good governance. I also speak 11 languages. Lately, I have been working on combining them with my new programming skills to capture voices from communities that usually go unheard by policymakers.\n\nI had just returned from the UK with a Master\u2019s Degree in Economics. I had learnt some specific programming in a language called Stata. But only in my last month in London, I befriended a machine learning expert who opened my eyes to how these technologies could be applied creatively and in designing applications. As a student of Political Science, English Literature and Economics at St. Xavier\u2019s College, I had for many years told myself that general coding was for engineers. Not my cup of tea. But I realized I was the one being robotic in my thinking. As I began to apply for my first jobs in India from home, I stumbled upon Udacity videos on Python. The rest is history.\n\nBack in 2014, when I first stumbled on Udacity, there weren\u2019t as many players in the data science education field as you see today. While many courses were teaching programming languages through game design, I liked how grounded Udacity\u2019s courses and exercises were in real-world data. Everything from Beatles discography to Enron fraud to diamond quality and Hans Rosling\u2019s famous animated visualization of health and economic statistics. I particularly loved how in several courses, we would see interviews with actual practitioners, and read their work in the context of our learning. It all felt so tangible. And necessary.\n\nWhen I eventually signed up as a paid student in November 2016, I had felt the need to link concepts in the classroom to actual problems at my workplace. Udacity does an excellent job of providing support. Their new feature of line Q&A truly is a blessing- I\u2019d have finished much faster if I\u2019d joined with that kind of support. And it\u2019s a testament to the quality of Udacity\u2019s work that much of the content I saw back in 2014 remains as relevant in 2017. I\u2019m both at the cutting edge, and yet fully immersed in the unchanging core of the subject.\n\nFor one thing, I received a promotion. I had become stuck doing a lot of technology contract management and technical administration. Which would be fine per se, but felt disconnected from all my experiences before it. Starting with database design in late 2016 (using the Data Wrangling course), I proved my mettle in the analytics domain. I was then assigned the designation of a \u2018Data Specialist\u2019. I have continued to lead my department with the latest in the field this year- including making Tableau, R and qualitative software a mainstay of our work. Work on visualization also allowed me to shape my role closer to communication- which ties in with my love of languages and writing.\n\nVery recently, I got to see my new skills leading to social impact in person. At QUEST Alliance, we often collected data from our partner organizations on the ground. Then we would run our analyses and take decisions accordingly. But by using interactive and easy to use platforms like Tableau to share our findings, we were able to help those field partners take decisions too.\n\nIn our Anandshala programme, we work with teachers, principals and various government officials to turn government schools into joyful learning spaces. In one of the rural schools we visited in Samastipur district of Bihar, the headmaster talked about how he managed his various duties and pointed at thick attendance registers. When we digitized that same data, cleaned it in Python, explored it in R and visualized it on Tableau, we could show them some charts with clear trends on my laptop. Those trends would have been impossible to notice just from the written entries in the register.\n\nWe could now see that students would who came to school did engage with classroom learning and did not run away as soon as they had the Midday Meal. But by comparing against the enrollment numbers, we could see that we could not be sure how many students would come in which month, especially around the festive season and floods.\n\nEven the principal\u2019s supervisor- a Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator stood transfixed. She immediately asked for us to send more such data analyses to help them improve their schools\u2019 performance. So for anyone who thinks that all government schools and those in charge of them do not care about the quality of education, perhaps it\u2019s time for a rethink. Armed with timely data and the tools to find insights from it, the possibilities are truly limitless. Even in places many people have given up hope on.\n\nI thank Udacity for allowing me to savour that moment with those teachers in a small sunlit school in the middle of cowsheds and verdant paddy fields. Where my own data science training was in some way helping hundreds of poor, underprivileged children with their basic education. So that we could give them the opportunity to discover their potential and stand a fair chance in the world, and bring a smile to them and their parents\u2019 faces."

It was quite normal for me to get pulled into a discussion about apps and ideas over coffee, brunch, dinner \u2026 you name it. I decided to be a maker too and started tinkering with javascript. I started learning on my own. I invested most of the time in researching the best resources online, enrolled in free courses, and read a few books. A couple of months later, found Udacity Nanodegree which promised me a break into this fantastic world.\n\nI started my Udacity journey with Front-End Nanodegree Program. Udacity is a platform which doesn\u2019t use a condescending tone for non-CS background and is quite approachable. This was apparent from the introduction and free courses. For someone like me, who is changing career paths, Udacity was quite helpful. It seems to have a passion to provide support and encouragement to people from varied backgrounds. It played an important role in boosting my confidence level very strongly.\n\nThe thing I really liked about Udacity and what makes it different from rest of the online courses are the projects. It is not like any other online portal where you submit the project, and that\u2019s it. Your project reviewers review the project thoroughly and approve only when it is 110% perfect. It helps you pay attention to minute details which you generally tend to miss.\n\nUdacity Nanodegrees also provide extensive career services which are beneficial for people like me. It includes specific tutorials on writing resumes, CV and interview preparation. \n\nAfter completing my Nanodegree, I also got a chance to attend Udacity Propel-their flagship job fair. And, yes I did get an internship in Frontend development :)\n\nGoing forward, I am really looking forward to enhancing my web developer skills and establish my career as a Front-end developer. Nano steps were taken but yes a big road ahead of me!"

        "text": "Automation was something that interested me since the first year of my college days. I am passionate about building automated and smart solutions to solve day-to-day problems. My Journey in automation in initial college days only with classroom training programs in Robotics and Embedded Systems. Further I participated in various robotics competitions, where I was introduced to Computer Vision and AI in general. Udacity\u2019s Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program helped me hone my skills further.\n\nI completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology Goa in 2016. In order to gain more experience and knowledge in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and AI, I worked at Bharti School, IIT-Delhi on automatic Object Detection in images along with a PhD scholar at IIT. We published our research work at the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2017, Beijing, China. I then joined the Health Technologies team at Public Health Foundation of India, Gurugram as a Machine Learning Consultant. I was given the opportunity to work with medical data and build solutions using Computer Vision and Machine Learning.\n\nWith the recent boom in Artificial Intelligence algorithms and technologies, I was really excited to learn how to implement Machine Learning and Deep learning solutions. I turned towards Udacity\u2019s highly appreciated Nanodegree programs for the same. First, I completed Udacity\u2019s open courses on Deep learning to build some foundation and then moved on to enrol myself in the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. I chose this Nanodegree since the curriculum of its first term included content that would help me in working on projects around the foundations of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.\n\nThe first term helped me learn about building Deep Learning systems and Computer Vision solutions in the context of Self-Driving Cars. The projects included real-world videos taken under highway-like conditions to build a foundation. I successfully built a Lane-Lines Detection system, German Traffic Sign Classifier, taught a car to drive itself in a simulator (Behavioural Cloning), Lane Finding System, and a Vehicle Tracking System. All these projects are well recognised in the industry and help in building the foundations in Computer Vision, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. The successive terms contain much more complex projects which I am yet to undertake.\n\nThe concepts that I learnt from the Nanodegree and other courses on Udacity have helped me in building a career in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Coming from a non-Computer Science background it is difficult to become a part of a fast-growing and highly competitive industry such as AI. Learning the core concepts of a new industry and implementing them helps a lot in building a good resume for that industry. All the interviews that I was able to qualify were because of my work and the projects that I have done. Projects instil confidence into the employer\u2019s mind that the candidate is well experienced with the methodology and roadblocks that anyone faces while actually implementing a solution.\n\nBeing a part of Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree program also helped me in becoming a part of the Udacity PropelX, where I was able to get interviews with disruptive tech-companies. I eventually secured an offer and joined Engineer.ai in Gurugram, Haryana as an AI and Machine Learning Ninja.\n\nUdacity has helped me become a part of the mainstream AI industry and I plan to build a career in Artificial Intelligence"

        "title": "Reinventing Recruiting Through Artificial Intelligence",
        "text": "Artificial Intelligence is the major transformer of today\u2019s industries and businesses. Simply put, it\u2019s the technology that uses algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data; or in other words, the technology we\u2019ve all been excited about. Many of 2017\u2019s businesses are using AI as an effective tool for their growth. In the networked digital era of today, it only seems right. Artificial intelligence is, according to Anuj Agrawal, \u201cthe new buzzword in the corporate world (\u2026) With the massive presence of smart devices and the surge of Big Data, AI is the new battleground that is roiling multiple sectors.\u201d An example of an industry who has been importantly shook up by AI is the recruitment industry, given that the data-driven approach of artificial intelligence not only creates a cure for the weaknesses of recruitment, but also has the ability to deliver strong efficiency. With that in mind, there\u2019s no doubt that the recruiter\u2019s role will (or already has) drastically change(d).\n\nAs almost 46% of recruiters consider that the most challenging part of their job is to identify the right candidates for a large applicant pool, AI is here to change the game by facilitating applicant vetting and matching candidates with jobs.\n\nYou may ask yourself: how does it work?\n\nAlgorithms use keyword matching (pretty much like Google uses Search Engine algorithms) to spot what is interesting or relevant to the information given. Keyword matching is useful when looking for specialized data. In the recruitment industry, this basically means that algorithms can identify the best available candidate for each job placement and vice versa. In fact, the idea of using algorithms in recruiting isn\u2019t new. As early as 2010, Matt Biddulph was already writing about his machine-based approach to identifying technology talent. With this elaborated technology\u2019s abilities, recruiters are better equipped to tackle massive amounts of information from resumes that would otherwise be piled up in hundreds\u2026 and maybe never even seen. Essentially, this is called \u2018Candidate Screening\u2019 or \u2018Automated Resume Screening\u2019. It is currently being used in today\u2019s biggest job platforms. Particularly, artificial intelligence is improving the process for applicant/job matchmaking to a greater extent.\n\nAlthough, AI doesn\u2019t only facilitate matchmaking \u2014 it also enhances candidate engagement in a very powerful way.\n\n\u201cCandidate engagement is good for your candidates, good for your brand, and good for your business.\u201d Mitesh Ashar, Vice President of Technical Product Management at Bullhorn\n\nA majority of job applicants are so used to never hearing anything back after sending their resumes that not only discourages them as candidates, but also leads to affecting the company\u2019s reputation in the long term. But thanks to artificial intelligence, recruiters now have the possibility to make it so much easier and reliable for job seekers to look and apply for placements \u2014 more than ever before. And in today\u2019s candidate-driven market, attracting talents by improving the candidate experience remains essential. In fact, recruiters have to start treating candidates as customers. By doing so, it evidently means saving a huge amount of time, for both ends of the spectrum: Job seekers and recruiters will benefit from it equally.\n\nIn that sense, AI is revolutionary in matchmaking and candidate engagement. But let\u2019s stop and think for a second, who is behind the magic?\n\nSome will argue that AI is inhumane\u2026 But at the end of the day, artificial intelligence is built by humans for humans. In other words, the algorithms are only as effective as the humans who develop them. Additionally, recruiting is a people\u2019s industry. If AI is used in recruiting, it\u2019s in order to facilitate human\u2019s processes of finding valuable individuals\u2026Algorithms have the ability to simplify candidate classification, surely, but that\u2019s not what recruitment is only about. Once candidates have been identified, recruiters still have to take charge of the whole hiring process. To this day, only humans have the capability to reach out and have a conversation, learn about someone, feel their energy, understand what they enjoy, etc. No software is capable of doing that\u2026yet. Essentially, AI is used to automate these banal tasks to allow recruiters to focus on their clients. So instead of finding people, recruiters can now focus on what they do best: recruiting people. Steve Levy, director of global sourcing at Indeed in Texas, once declared: \u201cThe evolutionary beauty behind these algorithms and \u2018talent analysis\u2019 is that they\u2019ll actually enable sourcers and recruiters to be more human (\u2026) and this will have a positive impact on hiring and retention.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence has the power to immensely change the recruiting industry, for better or for worse\u2026 We are only at the beginning of this \u2018robotics\u2019 era. Here\u2019s to revolutionizing the core function of human resource management!\n\nDigital Marketer at Jobable. Writes content on HR and career-related topics.

You will find out in the blog \u2018why\u2019.\n\n\u2018Never really thought about it\u2019 Or \u2018Yes, but I am skeptical if I am there.\u2019 Okay, now let\u2019s talk about what is that one thing that\u2019s stopping you from achieving that life goal. Probably, the answer would be \u2018you.\u2019 You are probably your biggest barrier and accelerator towards achieving your life goals.\n\nI am IIT Roorkee graduate in Electrical Engineering, but my heart lies in technical entrepreneurship. I have always thought about how technology helps solve complex business problems. Following my passion, I moved to Essex Business School, Paris for my MBA after working at Oracle for about two years. During this period, I worked on my startup called \u2018Leafbook\u2019 \u2014 discovering real-time and visually appealing digital content by scanning print media. It was during my venture that I felt a strong need for a top level understanding of data driven approach to big businesses and how businesses run, which led me to Udacity.\n\nThe Udacity Nanodegrees are built by companies like Google & Facebook, it is something in trend and updated. The theoretical concepts could be entirely different from real life applications, the Nanodegrees at Udacity mainly in focus with the industry perspective and the real life application of technologies. In other words, it\u2019s tailored for the acquiring the skillsets you might need every day.\n\nThere won\u2019t be a single moment that you will feel bored during your nanodegree. All thanks to interactive videos, quizzes, and projects. The videos are short and crisp which you can watch on-the-go. The course curriculum is a lot of fun than you would expect.\n\nA person like me with no exposure to technology, for us to stay in sync with technologies, we need strong content which is on-point and industry relevant. Udacity solves that need entirely.\n\nThe support that you have fellow learners is tremendously fantastic. Unlike other traditional education systems, you are a part of a community which is highly motivated in that particular field and is interested in growing together. You can see that energy and enthusiasm in various slack communities and community forums.\n\nI was amongst the first few graduates of Business Analyst Nanodegree and helped other students with feedback on their projects and resolving their queries.\n\nA part of your Nanodegree includes career support and guidance which will help in preparing you for your prospective job. Recently, I got to be a part of Udacity Propel \u2014 an initiative by Udacity to connect it\u2019s Nanodegree graduates to companies. I was selected for \u2018Software Architect\u2019 role at Wipro Digital. My role includes high-level design choices and dictating technical standards of the software. Through my role at Wipro, I got much clearer view of particular business solutions.\n\nI would highly recommend Udacity to individuals who are looking at enhancing specific skill sets and great industry relevant content. Pretty sure, with the right guidance and passion you will be a few more steps closer to your life goals."

        "text": "Our adoption of Kotlin started through the recognition of \u201cpain points\u201d that we experienced on a regular basis. During code review, comments like this started to crop up often:\n\nHaving experimented with Kotlin outside Udacity, we knew the language might help us solve these problems and build better Android apps. Because of this, it wasn\u2019t long before we had our first Kotlin PR\n\nA small feature was implemented in Java, and a pull-request opened; but along with that PR another was created that provided the same feature; only written in Kotlin. The Kotlin PR wasn\u2019t merged in that instance, but it demonstrated that we could easily integrate Kotlin into our existing app without compatibility issues or a slowdown in development time.\n\nThat was the jumping off point. We decided we would migrate a single, small feature in the app to Kotlin and see how it did in production.\n\nWe started by migrating our Settings screens in a separate develop branch. This branch received a lot of internal testing while we evaluated closely for 2 types of issues:\n\nWhen nothing arose, we shipped the new Kotlin feature to users and crossed our fingers. Thankfully, as we expected, no major issues were found. We were now happily using Kotlin in production.\n\nAfter that, we slowed down a bit. We loved using Kotlin, but recognized the potential risks of going all-in on an unofficially supported language. We continued to add/convert some tests to Kotlin, but no new feature code was using it.\n\nThen Google announced support for Kotlin as a first-class language for Android development."

Some of the new technologies like Machine Learning and Deep Learning are playing a major role in detecting rare diseases like cancer, medical history, image analysis in radiology and pathology, and much more!\n\nI am a Data Scientist with my expertise in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am a Machine Learning Nanodegree as well as Self-Driving Car Nanodegree graduate from Udacity.\n\nAfter my graduation, I had some offers from many big firms. I didn\u2019t want to join any of them because I didn\u2019t want to do what everyone else was doing. There was no course on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning in my university, but I knew that these were the real game changers. So, I started learning these things online. I started Machine Learning courses from other platforms. Then after completing it, I came across a free course on Deep Learning from Udacity. But, when I started doing Kaggle in August 2016, I realized that there is a lot of things that I am missing in applied Machine Learning. I thought to give a shot to Machine Learning Nanodegree as it covered a lot of aspects I wasn\u2019t even aware of, for e.g., Reinforcement learning. I liked the content and the way in which it was taught. It was the first time I paid for an online course, but it was damn good in every aspect.\n\n I opted for Machine Learning in Sep 2016, binge-studied, and finished it in Oct 2016.\n\nTechnology-wise, I am biased towards Machine Learning, and have much interest in that. Things made me interested in Self-Driving Car and its role in saving lives was a personal incident where I lost one of my very close friends. I believe autonomous vehicles could be the great public-health achievement of the 21st century. Driver-less Cars are poised to save millions of lives in future.\n\nWhen Self-Driving Car Nanodegree was announced, I knew that it was a lot of money for an online course. But my past experience with Nanodegree was so good that I knew that it would be good no matter what. Also, some of my fellow Kagglers also opted for the same. To be very honest, I was going to opt out in the first week, but then I realized that this could be my chance to stand out from the crowd even without having MS or Ph.D. Also, as one of my friends suggested: \u201cLook for the future. You will be years ahead of others by the time they get into this thing. \u201d I don\u2019t think I could have made a better decision. Every aspect of Nanodegree was worth doing it.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Udacity is much better than other platforms but some of the things that really make Udacity stand out of the crowd are: \n\n1) Top notch content developed by tech giants: Yes, you heard it right. The content is developed by some of the big names in the industry. For example, term 2 in SDCND was developed by Mercedes-Benz while term 3 was developed by Nvidia. These are the things that engineers in these companies use for research and production. You don\u2019t get this kind of content anywhere else.\n\n2) Highly talented instructors: Not only the content is developed by tech giants, even the instructors are the highly talented engineers working in these companies. For example, during SDCND, term 1 was taught by Sr. engineers, and team lead at Uber whereas, term 2 was taught by the robotics team at Mercedes-Benz and term3 was taught by leading researchers at Nvidia.\n\n3) Real-world projects: During my SDCND, we did Behavioral cloning, Vehicle detection and tracking in real time, path planning, semantic segmentation of road. All these projects are a part of a real self-driving car. Each of these is done at scale by self-driving car companies.\n\n4) Hiring Partners: Udacity not only trains you for a particular field but it also helps you in getting a job in that field. There are dozens of hiring partners associated with each Nanodegree.\n\nNo other platform provides such things. And trust me, I have checked almost all good platforms for e-learning but, none compares to the standards of Udacity.\n\nI think it\u2019s the learning curve that matters the most. After doing the Nanodegrees, I found that my skills have leveled up a lot as compared to the people I was working with. I learned so many things in the field of robotics as well as Machine Learning or Deep Learning, while doing the Nanodegrees. In short, Nanodegrees has helped in polishing my skills. If you are currently enrolled into a Nanodegre, My advise would be \u201cDon\u2019t give up. Commitment and focus, that\u2019s all you need while pursuing the Nanodegrees. Things can be overwhelming at times. Trust me, it is going to be worth it in the end. You don\u2019t get such opportunities every day. Learn as much as you can. This is the time and this is the platform.\u201d\n\nThrough the skills that I have acquired, I want to contribute to the society as much as I can. I want to apply my knowledge the fields of healthcare, self-driving cars, flying cars, drones, etc. These are the things that actually matter, create an impact, and would save millions of lives every year."

It helps get not only hands-on experience but also a strong testament to your skills during job interviews.\n\nThe community and mentors are very helpful whenever you are stuck at a project or struggling with any problem statement. Unlike other platforms, Udacity has an amazing community of fellow learners who are always ready to help you out and share learnings. Here are some of the projects I built in my Nanodegree:\n\nDuring my Nanodegree itself, I got selected for an internship at Limetray. Luckily, got a chance to attend Udacity Propel and got four job offers. Although all these job profiles required experienced professionals, Udacity Nanodegree and projects helped a lot in highlighting the skills. Currently, I am working on my own start-up called KoinOK \u2014 Cryptocurrency Exchange.\n\nIf you are looking for a career in Full Stack development, Udacity\u2019s Full Stack Nanodegree would be a great start."

It gave me a chance to understand how the education system works over the world and also, learn from them. Exploration has been an integral part of my life and, that\u2019s how lifelong learning became a passion to me.\n\nIn my first two years at DTU, I loved practicing problems on online platforms like Codechef and Codeforces, however, in my third year, I realized I didn\u2019t know about developing \u2018cool\u2019 things that can impact millions of people in India. On recommendation from my brother, I stumbled across Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. I started the Android journey, and eventually got selected as a Software Engineer in Edfora and also got selected for GSoC at FOSSASIA for an Android project.\n\nAfter this, I never look back and always wait for new nanodegrees from Udacity. Recently I completed the Deep Learning Nanodegree, and a month later I got my research paper selected at an International Conference to be held later this month. I am currently enrolled into Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. I believe Autonomous vehicles have an enormous potential in future and the key to saving millions to lives.\n\nTwo things that make Udacity Nanodegrees better than rest of online education platforms is their content quality and mentorship support. Udacity Nanodegrees have rich and engaging content, which has much more practical relevance for the industry. The mentorship support during the Nanodegrees have been phenomenal whenever I am stuck with a project or course content; I can always count on my mentors. The Udacity mentors will help you achieve your goals and guide you through getting the best out of your Nanodegree. If you have enrolled into Udacity Nanodegrees, I would advise you to make full use of community and mentorship support.\n\nSome of things I worked upon after my Nanodegrees:\n\nThe big difference I see in myself is I have improved as a programmer each day than earlier when I just aimed at solving a competitive problem and be happy about I approached it. It didn\u2019t make me a better programmer as for me I want my code to change lives of others. I am have been an active contributor to a lot of mobile and web forums, continuing my path on lifelong-learning."

        "text": "My father has worked in the IT industry all his life. Watching him work on his laptop all day and hear stories about how technology is doing wonders in the real world are one of my treasured childhood memories. I had programming as a part of my curriculum at school and it felt good to write code for fun. This was back in 2011 and Android had just started to pick up speed in the market.\n\nAnd a few years later, it hit me. I realised that I could create apps on my own that people would use every day and that got me excited.\n\nAt first, I used to think of an idea and Google around to see how I could design a solution for that. I toiled around for hours and days but ultimately I would create something which I would be proud of, and it made me want to create something more, something better.\n\nI am a member of Google Developers Group (GDG) New Delhi, and one day I got an email from them informing me about the Android Developer Nanodegree scholarships being offered by Udacity. That\u2019s when I went through the Udacity website and found out that Udacity offers great courses and that too for free. I applied for the scholarship as well. Meanwhile, I was already learning Android on my own but when I tried out Udacity\u2019s courses on Android, I wished that I had come across them earlier. Luckily, I got the Android Developer Nanodegree scholarship as well.\n\nUdacity\u2019s courses are laid out brilliantly. Their video content has actual people talking to you and not just screencasts of an IDE is what made me trust Udacity. The lectures are so interactive that it feels like a connection just like that of an actual classroom. The Android course creators at Udacity are developer advocates from Google itself and their content certainly shows the amount of research they have put into 2 things:\n\n \n\n 1. What a student wants when he\u2019s learning\n\n 2. What the IT industry wants from developers\n\nTheir content has quizzes, exercises and models real-world situations where you get to work on starter codes. I developed 6 projects during my Nanodegree and I felt that I got better with each one of them. That\u2019s what kept me motivated.\n\nI completed my Nanodegree in January this year and the skills I obtained during my Nanodegree helped me get 3 job offers from app development companies before I graduated. I\u2019d recommend their Android Developer Nanodegree to every college student who wants to build amazing apps.. If you have no prior experience with Android, their Android Foundation Nanodegree could do wonders for you. Udacity also offers NDs for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Digital Marketing and much more.\n\nIn July, I appeared for Google\u2019s Associate Android Developer Certification Exam in collaboration with Udacity and managed to get certification on my first attempt since I already had the skills required for it, thanks to my Nanodegree. If you\u2019d like to know about the exam as it happened, tips & FAQs, please go through the following 2 posts:\n\nIn April this year, I got a chance to attend Udacity Propel held in Gurgaon since I was an Android Developer Nanodegree graduate.\n\nWhen I was in college, I took the Git & Github course by Udacity as well. I\u2019d also recommend their HTML & CSS course which I\u2019m currently pursuing so that I can build my own website.\n\nIf you are looking for an online course to launch your career in Android app development, Udacity might be a great choice for you as well \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nFollow me on Medium here."

        "text": "Nearly nine out of ten smartphones run on Android. This makes the Google\u2019s OS a very attractive target for developers all over the world. This article should help us understand different components that make an Android app.\n\nThis article is a part of Udacity\u2019s Mobile Development series. While not required, it is recommended to read Introduction to Mobile Development.\n\nAndroid was conceptualized almost a decade ago. First version of Android was released to public in 2008. Since then, Android has undergone a lot of changes. This article is relevant to the last few versions of Android.\n\nUser interface forms the first impression of the app. Good visuals and smooth animations can mean the difference between a good app and a great app. Google recommends the Material Design language to provide a beautiful and consistent experience. Material.io is a great resource for designers and developers alike. Android SDK provides multiple tools and APIs that enable developers to create awesome user experiences.\n\nLayouts: A layout describes how different pieces of UI fit on the screen. In Android, layouts are typically described using XML files. Each such layout file may contain descriptions of one or more UI components. Layout files also describe how the components are positioned on the screen.\n\nFor a sufficiently complex app, separating UI into different files is very important. Android SDK allows us to have different layouts depending on factors like screen size, device orientation, pixel density, etc.\n\nActivities and Fragments: In a typical app, a screen (or a page) roughly corresponds to an activity. The activity may chose one or more layouts and render them on the screen. Activity is also responsible for handling different object events (like button clicks, list scrolls, etc.) occurring on the user interface.\n\nFragments, as the name suggest, define pieces of the UI in a screen. Fragments play very important role in an app targeting multiple screen sizes. The app may need to display more information on a tablet to take advantage of the larger screen as opposed to a phone. Fragments enable reuse of layout and code in such cases.\n\nAnimations: Animations serve dual purpose in an app. Firstly, they guide the user\u2019s focus to relevant content. Secondly, they reduce the perceived latency by keeping the user interface active while loading is done in the background.\n\nAndroid SDK provides multiple ways to animate objects. A developer can animate multiple properties of an object such as length, height, position, opacity, etc. The SDK also provides ways to add transition animations to the app so that different screens within an app smoothly transition from one another.\n\nResources: Resources define the static information in an app. This may involve text, colors, sizes, images etc. Android SDK provides ways to load different resources depending on the runtime conditions.\n\nText resources contain the text used for introduction tutorials, form titles, button labels, etc. Since we can load different resource based on the device language, it is easy to provide translations of an app without touching the code. All one needs to do is create a resource file for the new language that contains all the necessary text.\n\nImage resources consist of app logos, in app images, etc. Having different resources for different screen sizes allows us to selectively use high resolution images on a high density display to provide sharp picture and use smaller images on smaller displays \u2014 thereby saving memory.\n\nBusiness logic consists of database interactions, web service calls, data manipulation, calculations, etc. Android provides multiple ways to achieve this.\n\nCore APIs: Java is the primary programming language for Android development. This means that plethora of libraries written for Java over the years are instantly available for Android. Most of the Android platform APIs are available using Java.\n\nIn addition to Java, Android team recognizes Kotlin as an official app development language.\n\nNative APIs: C++ is the language of choice for developers consuming native APIs. Since these APIs provide better control over the underlying hardware \u2014 especially the GPU \u2014 C++ is heavily used in game development.\n\nAndroid Support Library: Android has come a long way since its inception. A lot of new features and APIs have been added. However, plenty of devices are still on the older versions of Android.\n\nThe chart shows what percentage of users using each of the Android version as of August 2017. While the latest version \u2014 Nougat \u2014 has 13.5% users, 77.5% of the users still user one of the three older versions of Android.\n\nAndroid Support Library provides backward compatibility for the APIs added in newer versions. In other words, the support library provides us with the features that otherwise would only be available on the newer platform versions.\n\nIn this post we looked at the core components of an Android app. This post mainly dealt with the official way of building an Android app. Android Nanodegree by Udacity is a great resource for people willing to learn end to end app development.\n\nThere are many other frameworks and platforms that can make app development process easier. Some platforms like Xamarin and PhoneGap allow developers to use different stacks like C#/.NET and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. We will take a look at those technologies in upcoming articles. Stay tuned.\n\nAbout author: Akshay is a software engineer who works on Mobile, Big Data and anything in between.

A family that lives in the housing in the sky, has a robotic maid \u2018Rosie\u2019, and drive \u2018saucer like\u2019 flying cars. Looks like the future is already here, this time sooner than you\u2019d expect.\n\nBig companies around the world are working towards how we travel today. The first-ever project on flying car dates back to 1926, when Henry Ford displayed an experiment of single-seat aeroplane called \u2018skyfliver\u2019. In recent developments, companies like Lilium, Aeromobil and Skydiver have been working aggressively towards making Flying Cars a reality and the first prototypes are already in the air.\n\nThrough our Flying Car Nanodegree program launch, our goal is to teach a new generation of engineers the skills necessary to build this smart transportation future. We want to teach students to push beyond the current generation of quadrotors and remote-controlled drones, and give them the skills to create autonomous flight vehicles that will be crucial to the transportation systems of the future.\n\nOn the other hand, our new Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program lets anyone with minimal programming experience taste the thrills of building self-driving cars. We empower you to understand the essentials of programming a self-driving car: from machine learning to object-oriented programming to probabilistic robotics. When you graduate from this program with your very own Nanodegree credential in hand, you won\u2019t quite be an expert (yet). However, you would have experienced what it means to build self-driving cars, and hopefully will engage in a path of learning that will forever change your life. You will get guaranteed admission into the advanced Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program upon completion.\n\nWith Toyota\u2019s new announcement of launching flying cars in 2020 Olympics and all-new self driving car revolution, the future of smart transportation looks shining bright. And, you have the power to influence it."

With specific targeting and re-marketing, it delivers relevant and timely ads that resonate with your audience.\n\nLet us help you witheverything you need to get started with Google Display Advertising:\n\nYou can target audiences on the display network to narrow your reach to people more likely to be interested in your products or services. This can be achieved via:\n\nPlacement targeting refers to the option of choosing which websites you want to appear on, thus giving you the most control over where you\u2019re going to appear on the GDNs.\n\nThis is the most common targeting type, since it utilizes the keywords related to the products and services you offer. Instead of trying to come up with likely search queries like you would do for a search network campaign, you should be writing a list of 5\u201320 words or short phrases that are very closely related to the subject of your Ads.\n\nTopic targeting allows you to choose from an existing list of page topics, meaning that your ads will only display on pages about that topic. For example, a topic can be as broad as \u2018fitness\u2019, whereas your ad may be highly targeted towards \u2018Tai-chi\u2019.\n\nInterest targeting lets advertisers target the user, not the page content, this means that the user might be looking at anything when your ad appears (provided they\u2019re on a site within the GDN).\n\nRemarketing allows you to deposit a cookie on the computers of the visitors to pages on your website. Google will then display ads specifically to those people whenever they visit sites on the Google Display Network.\n\nAdWords display targeting is most effective when a combination of targeting methods are used. If an advertiser applies more than one targeting method to an ad group, their ads will only display to people who match both targeting criteria.\n\nCombining one or more different targeting methods will reduce the potential impressions of your ads, but will leave you with extremely well targeted ad groups. If you create enough of these kind of Ad Groups, you\u2019ll be able to mimic your high traffic ad groups, but with much more effective targeting.\n\nFor example, you could combine topics and interest targeting. If a user visits a site within the topic an advertiser selects, and they\u2019re in a matching interest category too then it\u2019s clear that the user consistently reads that material. This combination improves the advertisers chances of getting the right type of visitor compared to either topics or interest categories alone.\n\nThe main method for optimizing display campaigns is to regularly review the automatic placements report, and add relevant placements. We\u2019d also advise adding any irrelevant or poor performing sites as negative placements in your automatic placement campaign.\n\nThere are plenty of other strategies you could implement to continually improve the performance of your display network campaigns but if you\u2019re just starting out on the Display Network and want to closely monitor performance on specific sites then reviewing your placements report on a regular basis is where you should focus your time.\n\nHope this article will helped you in understanding the basics of Google Display Networks.\n\nWant to learn more about \u2018Display Advertising\u2019?

Everyone had a major heartbreak in episode 6 when Daenerys\u2019s dragon \u2018Viserion\u2019 slowly shudders into the ice, and moreover becomes a wight. With Season Finale coming up, there\u2019s much anticipation about which character is going to die next?\n\nIn the finale trailer, major stakeholders will gather in King\u2019s Landing to discuss a ceasefire. Will Cersei try and pull a gambit similar to when she blew up the Sept of Baelor and take out all her enemies at once? We will discuss in this article all the possibilities.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some major Fan theories first about how Game of thrones end would look like:\n\nJaime has seen Daenerys\u2019 dragons first-hand, he knows Cersei won\u2019t win in an open battle, and he\u2019s clearly not happy with the direction the kingdom and his family are taking. Even though Jaime has said repeatedly that Cersei is the most important thing in his life, he may be more sympathetic to Tyrion\u2019s pleas after discovering his little brother didn\u2019t murder Joffrey at the Purple Wedding. Given his reputation as the Kingslayer, it would be much justice to have Jaime kill the Mad Queen.\n\nThere has been a widely popular theory that the Stark kids have been plotting against Littlefinger all this while. Firstly, Sansa\u2019s never kept her distrust of Littlefinger a secret; just last season she told Jon Snow: \u201cOnly a fool would trust Littlefinger.\u201d And, then she tells Bran \u201cHe\u2019s not a generous man. He wouldn\u2019t give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back\u201d. There\u2019s a high possibility that Arya Stark might execute Littlefinger on the orders of Sansa Stark, and Bran will help his sisters in finding out the true reality.\n\nAccording to the prophecy, \u201cWhen the red star bleeds, and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.\u201d Melisandre has been putting her bet on Jon Snow. For Jon Snow to be Azor Ahai, he must kill his beloved wife. The direction of the show right now has clear signals that Jon and Daenerys are in love. Hence, there is a huge possibility Jon Snow will kill Daenerys.\n\nBran = Night King is one of the most mind-blowing fan theory yet!\n\nBran has green sight and the ability to warg. He keeps traveling back and forth in time in a bid to fix things, and destroy the White Walkers once for all. In season 6, he goes back to the time when the first white walker was created by Children of the forests. In this episode, Bran wakes up by flinching his eyes as if he is experiencing the pain. There might be a possibility that he is into the man\u2019s body but, since he can\u2019t change the past, he is stuck in that body now. Jon Snow, the prince who was promised, will eventually have to kill his own brother to save others.\n\nResearcher \u2018Milan Janosov\u2019 used the techniques of Machine Learning to come up with an \u201caggregated network of the realm\u2019s social system\u201d:\n\nHe also came up with this probability of character deaths:\n\nDo you have any theory who will die in the season Finale and the last season?

        "text": "Data science is big, and it\u2019s going to be bigger. The fact itself \u2018there was much more data generated in last two years than the last 5000 years\u2019 says everything about how we are consuming data today. It is becoming crucial not just for large IT industries, but also for industries like healthcare, travel, entertainment, and gaming. It\u2019s helping businesses understand customer needs, challenges, and insights about things that work better. Here\u2019s is a brief look at how various industries have been using data for their success:\n\n1) Healthcare Healthcare industries use data mining technologies like machine learning, deep learning, relational databases to extract key insights from patient\u2019s medical history. The trends, patterns and other information help doctors identify the risk of chronic diseases and prescribe better treatment options.\n\n2) Travel Access to faster internet, social media influence, unparalleled growth in the travel industry. Personalization being one of the top offerings, travel industry is using big data to enhance customer experience, build customer relationships, enhance recommendation process. Pricing is one of the important decision-making factors for travel customers. Smart automation of data analysis helps industries gather, index and filter real-time data from multiple sources to create perfect suggestions and forecast fare changes in future.\n\nWondering how fitness companies can leverage fitness? Actually, they can in many ways! One of the most premium fitness company is big data to collect & analyze data on customer\u2019s workouts, calories burned, calories consumed, and total steps in a day to act as \u2018virtual coach\u2019 to help meet their fitness goals.\n\nKnowing your customers the most important aspect of marketing. Marketers just don\u2019t just need an abundance of insights; we need the ability to turn them into actions, and more importantly, we need to be able to automate those actions. The data collected local advertisements, social profiles, mobiles has given birth to a new era of marketing called as \u2018Real-time marketing\u2019. It helps to get a precise and accurate view into their audiences helping them understand buyer behavioral patterns. The future of marketing would be based totally on how to analyze this data generated to send relevant information. at the very beginning of buyer\u2019s cycle.\n\n5) Crime & Investigation\n\nMuch of the criminal investigative process is conducted through gathering evidence, which is impossible without complex data mining procedures that follow mathematical algorithms. Forensic investigators and data scientists use data science to prepare data for analysis, find crime patterns, and study the criminal mind, which assists criminal investigation agencies in arriving at quicker, correct conclusions.\n\nAgriculture is based on various factors soil, climate, seed, cultivation methods, irrigation facilities, fertilizers, pesticides, harvesting etc.Agriculture companies analyze data to predict important factors that will impact the overall produce including weather trends, soil fertility recommendations, harvesting time, etc.\n\nWith the concept of Digital India and demonization, banking is becoming more digital than ever. Digital wallets and UPI are becoming a much more convenient way of transactions. Banks are using insights from data to analyze the patterns of transactions, cross sell products, detect fraudulent activities, improve screening for loans and customer retention.\n\nMaster the skills you need to establish a successful data science career with our Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. Our curriculum was developed with leading industry partners to ensure students master the most cutting-edge skills.

Sadly, we didn\u2019t have any such course in our curriculum covering each and every basics of Android development. I had only a little experience in Andriod app development and, hence I have been looking out for developing my skills in this area through some online courses which would open prospects for me in future. Then, one of my friend introduced me to Udacity\u2019s Android Nanodegrees. I started my journey with Android Basics Nanodegree and so far loving my experience. The Nanodegree aims to \u201censure you master the exact skills necessary to build a career in Android development.\u201d I learned so much from my instructors, mentors (people you actually interact with the most) and Udacity forums (an amazing place where you can share your learning; get help from others). When regularly interact with your peer group, reading their code and getting them to debug your code, your learning curve is bound to speed up.\n\nHalf way through my Nanodegree, I already have two projects in my hand, one of them being an application for an International conference.\n\nThere is one thing I would really want to share. Before opting for the ABND (Android Basics Nanodegree) I have done android development in my university, so I was somewhat familiar with android but I was not confident what I write, I always tend to Google in order to develop something and which was not working out. This happens because when we were taught android they assumed that we know everything in Java and OOPS(Object Oriented Programming System).\n\nOn the other hand, Udacity Nanodegree started with basic and raise student to intermediate. As they assumed that student pursuing ABND don\u2019t have knowledge of OOPS and Java. I was amazed by their teaching style during my trial period of the Nanodegree and it was my first time experience with the Udacity. I recommend this course to everyone who wanted to learn Android (Best course in the world). Another part I really like are the concepts through real world applications which help students to grasp the concept quickly. I have learn so many things but never forgot because whenever I try to remember I just look at all the images used to explain those concepts.\n\nI love the way Katherine Kuan teaches; she engages student by small activities so that student don\u2019t get bored in the course. Small interviews from the experts in android helped me to gain insight into the industry and how they tackle problems and provide solutions. Indeed, it helped changed my way of thinking :)\n\nAgain, there are projects where Udacity distinguishes itself from the rest of the online education platforms. They invest in their project review process, and it makes your investment and time totally worth it. All the projects reinforce the content you learn in the video, the project evaluation is based on the rubrics. They review your project in detail so that you get to know what is wrong/correct/ supervise you on how to make it much better. Mentors of forums and communities are particularly useful when you are stuck in projects. Find the forums to see if your problem is normal (they are usually). No luck finding one, post your question, a forum mentor or someone from the forum will reply to you within some time.\n\nUdacity Nanodegree taught me necessary technical skills, helped me in building confidence and much more \u2014 A must course for the budding Android developers. Udacity is an awesome platform to start your upskilling journey, and I am happy to be a part of it. I would highly recommend Udacity to any Android Developer aspirants :)"

It might be one of the ultimate solutions to reduce traffic related accidents and environmental concerns. But there are some major challenges that the SDCs may face such as unpredictable pedestrians, lighting changes, construction zones and an absolute human error probability of 0.000001%. Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence are one of the major key components helping us make fully automated vehicles a reality.\n\nDeep Learning is the closest algorithm how a human would learn. Rather being a set of codes, there are a lot of situations that come up in the real-world (ground truths) for e.g. which side is right or wrong, if it\u2019s a car or bicycle, pole or a tree. And, it gradually will start to generate its own set of rules on how to navigate on the road.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re developing a self-driving car, the hard part is handling the edge cases. These include weather conditions like rain or snow, for example. Right now, people program in specific rules to get this to work. The deep learning approach instead learns what to do by fundamentally understanding the data.\u201d \u2014 Carol Reiley, President \u2014 Drive.ai.\n\nThe core approach of Deep Learning in Self-Driving cars lies on the concept of teaching them how you would ideally teach a human. This involves providing the system with multiple situations, objects, and scenarios, then letting the system apply the rules to real world situations. Task-oriented Deep learning will help feed the system with localization and mapping, scene understanding, movement planning and driver\u2019s state. End-to-end deep learning maps sensor data directly to vehicle controls and predict steering wheel positions, accelerator or break strength, and for making decisions.\n\nUdacity\u2019s Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree virtually the only program of its kind to provide 360 learning experience \u2014 one that allows professionals to develop the in-demand skills and gain actual hands-on experience with self-driving systems.\n\nProbably, start with understanding the basic foundations of Deep Learning that would further help you master advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Self-Driving Car.\n\nAlready a Deep Learning expert, apply for the below:"

It\u2019s just your will and actions that make it easier for you to achieve your dreams!\n\nMost of you might have seen movies like Lakshya, Wake Up Sid and Tamasha. Some of these might be very close to your heart. Because it tells a story. The story of a guy whom you meet every day when you see yourself in the mirror.\n\nMy story is no different or unusual. 20 years old, born and brought up in New Delhi, pursuing B.COM from Delhi University and chasing dreams the society kept in front of me. But, I always wanted to be different, play with those binary numbers, and build something of my own that would bring an impact. The idea of being able to build something from scratch that could help or entertain millions & billions of people around the world was my ultimate motivation. That\u2019s what brought me to Udacity!\n\nI searched for best online courses to learn to program on Google, and \u2018Udacity\u2019 was the top result to show up. I also read tons of reviews of courses and the website itself, and soon enough I realized that it is the one I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve found one of the best (if not the best) resources to start my dream career in the programming world. Coming from a commerce background, I had never written a single line of code ever before and watching all the code at once was very-very overwhelming and intimidating but I had decided that I won\u2019t be scared of these funny looking lines and would do my best to understand everything. Fortunately, the teachers here at Udacity are amazing people and great teachers. It\u2019s all because of them that I was able to finish my course so quick and easily. Here is a screenshot of one of my current projects:\n\nA few weeks ago, I would have never imagined that I\u2019ll ever be able to design or create something of my own from scratch by coding but I did that and did it well, I believe. Thanks Katherine Kuan ma\u2019am for all the guidance and support throughout!\n\nRecently, I have built an app for my uncle for his local business, and he is quite impressed. The focus right now is to improve my skills as much as I can and build as many apps as possible in one year.\n\nThe best part I realized after completing my Nanodegree was, that it leaves you with immense intellect and the desire to create better technology. One such desire is to contribute to the society through my newly acquired skills. I am also looking forward to coming up with a great idea that I could share with people all around the world."

        "title": "5 ingredients of a successful digital marketing plan",
        "text": "There\u2019s no doubt; Digital Marketing is at its pinnacle! Digital Marketing is an integral part of every Marketer core strategy. You might have run various marketing campaigns for business; some of them really succeed, and some of them fail with absolute no ROI. So, what\u2019s makes a successful digital marketing plan ensuring great results? Some of the key ingredients of a successful plan:\n\nP.S. For a better understanding, let\u2019s assume, we are a travel agency called \u2018Adventure Calling\u2019, focusing on adventure travel, whose main target audience is people of 21\u201340 age bracket and from Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities.\n\nThe first & most important step of creating a plan is to define exactly what do you want to achieve from digital. For e.g. Position \u2018Adventure calling\u2019 as a go-to destination for all travel seekers.\n\nNow, that you have an objective, define your KPIs. Analyze your previous digital marketing efforts, if any.\n\nIdentify tools to measure your KPIs for e.g. Using Google Analytics to track conversions and Hootsuite for social media analytics.\n\nA lot of us make this mistake of not keeping digital and offline communication in sync. For e.g. You launch an email campaign along the lines of \u201cMonsoon Sale \u2014 20% off on all packages\u201d. And, when people come to your social media, your assets are not yet updated. It\u2019s a failed communication plan.\n\nAlways create your plan in a way that it has similar communication across all platforms. So, your audience can connect the dots. Your digital marketing plan must be a fit to your overall marketing plan.\n\nKeeping your content relevant to your target audience is a must. Speak their language and serve emotional needs from your brand. Dig deeper into audience insights \u2014 Age, Gender, Location. Understand their tonality and what do they want from your brand. For e.g. Here your brand tonality has to be casual, light-hearted and inspiring you to travel more.\n\nIdentify your possible influencers to create a positive word-of-mouth in your target audience. Influencers, in this case, play a major role in extending the reach and increasing brand awareness.\n\nA lot of us get very ambitious while working on this part and end up spending money on irrelevant things with zero ROI. It\u2019s important to define your budget and specific KPI of each channel. Learn from your previous campaigns; it is not necessarily important to invest on every platform. For e.g. In this case, Blogs and Instagram could be the most relevant platform for you.\n\nLast but very important plan, don\u2019t let your plan be set in stone. Keep analyzing and decide what\u2019s working for you and what\u2019s not. There might be a high possibility that you thought something would get x amount of reach and it performed way below your expectations. Experiment, do a lot more A/B tests, try to analyze what did not work for you and improvise. Was it the creative? Or the copy? Maybe the same copy with a different creative will perform exceptionally well.\n\nInterested in learning more digital, Enroll Now in Udacity Digital Marketing course\n\nAlso, let us know your feedback in the comments section below!"

        "text": "Video games have always been an interest for AI researchers. Might be sounding unreal, but video games like Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft can actually help you a lot in learning how Artificial Intelligence works.\n\nUnderstanding and learning how to navigate in a 3D structure is a great tool to learn AI. As you get to learn how AI might work in complex real-life situations. In previous attempts to learn embodied cognition, there involved a lot of robots with sensors, teaching them how to operate into the real world and bumping into the things. And hence, there was a lot of maintenance work involved into it. This didn\u2019t turn to be a huge success as there were many problems in scaling up this business. With virtual robot in a virtual world, there is obviously no maintenance required, no specifications and maintaining separate parts involved. The environment can be easily altered and manipulated. A computer can run thousands of such simulations at a time, allowing legions of virtual robots to try tasks, again and again, learning with each attempt. That kind of large-scale testing, which permits the learning process itself to be monitored and understood, is simply not practical using real machines. Hence, is a much logical approach towards learning embodied cognitive.\n\nAccording to a team of from Intel and Darmstadt University in Germany, Video games are not only in the high fidelity of material appearance and light transport simulation. It is also in the content of the game worlds: the layout of objects and environments, the realistic textures, the motion of vehicles and autonomous characters, the presence of small objects that add detail, and the interaction between the player and the environment.\n\nBack in 2015, Google AI was successfully able to win 50 Atari games.But, almost forgot it\u2019s strategy right after the game, after it had moved on to the next game. It is not only teaching them to train it\u2019s DeepMind artificial intelligence to remember the strategies using an algorithm called Elastic Weight Consolidation. This algorithm will help the AI to learn things instead just dumping the data. So far, it has been great at beating Breakout.\n\nThis year has been tremendous in the field of Artificial Intelligence winning games. Here is a brief throwback why:\n\nRecently, Google\u2019s AlphaGo software has defeated its human opponent in the first of a three-game Go match held this week at the Future of Go festival in China. While AlphaGo is making its mastery of the game look effortless, Go has typically been harder for AI to beat than chess.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI is the first to reach a perfect score of 999,990 in PacMan, surpassing the best human score by 4x. The scientists used a method called Hybrid Reward Architecture, used more than 150 agents, each of which worked in parallel with the other agents to master Pac-Man.\n\nHere\u2019s how they did it\n\nA team of AI researchers from Princeton University has been teaching AI how to drive with \u2018Grand Theft Auto V.\u2019 Using the graphic library in the game and injecting some additional software, providing labels that you come across while driving including pedestrians, traffic signals, cyclists, electric poles, trees and the sky. Here\u2019s how Youtuber Python Plays explains it.\n\nIt\u2019s quite apparent that AI is getting closer to start learning and behaving like humans. And, the future is quite near than you think.

        "text": "\u201cLook at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push \u2014 in just the right place \u2014 it can be tipped.\u201d \n\n\u2015 Malcolm Gladwell, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard inspiring stories of individuals who follow their passions and become successful entrepreneurs. What sets them apart? Successful entrepreneurs understand the needs of the community and come up with creative ideas to address those needs. Often these ideas are breathtakingly imaginative and challenge the status quo. Resonating with the customer and maintaining an emotional bond is an integral part of their success.\n\nThe Internet and the influx of social media networks enable the formation of online communities based on shared relationships and interests. Customers are expressing their opinions, sentiments, and emotions in their communities. Although the current digital landscape makes customers accessible, its complex and often conflicting layers of information make building trust challenging.\n\nIt requires an effective digital strategy to navigate through rapidly evolving platforms and establish a positive relationship with customers.A holistic understanding of the digital marketing field can help aspiring entrepreneurs avoid unnecessary expenses and hire the right talent wherever needed. Following are some key areas.\n\nIt is important to understand how well your idea addresses the customers\u2019 needs, its competitiveness, its long-term growth, its ability to sustain changing trends. Performing market research can help define the value proposition for your business. There are many market research tools available for free or at a low cost. For example, Survey Monkey helps conduct customized surveys on your customer needs, preferences, etc.\n\nUnderstanding your customers\u2019 likes, dislikes, sentiments, and behavior patterns is important to connect with them emotionally. Customer research through surveys, interviews, and data about their demographics, age, income, relationship status, and interests can help define your target customer. MakeMyPersona by HubSpot is a great tool to create a target customer persona.\n\nAn online presence can help build a brand for your business. Create a website that focuses on user experience and responsive web design. Optimize for search, generate content that engages your customer, and maintain an active presence in the social media channels your customers use. HootSuite helps you manage multiple social media profiles from its platform.\n\nMaintaining positive image across all online platforms is essential for gaining customer trust. Monitor and respond to feedback and improve customer experience. Social Mention can help you monitor social media presence based on keywords. Google Alerts generates email alerts with a search around your brand.\n\nInvesting in digital marketing education is an advantage. Udacity offers a Digital Marketing Nano Degree program built by industry leaders. It covers various platforms, frameworks, and tools in the field. Students also gain practical experience by working on live marketing campaigns.\n\nNote: This medium article was originally published by Shilpa Madini."

        "text": "IT industry is blossoming with around 18.2 million software developers worldwide, a number that is due to rise to 26.4 million by 2019, a 45% increase. With so many other developers out there I always used to wonder what can I do to stand out, I realized the only way to do it was to upskill myself and learn emerging technologies.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW UDACITY\n\nFirst time I heard of Udacity was from a friend whom I met during a hackathon. His review of Udacity was something which tempted me to check out their courses and Nanodegrees.\n\nOnce I checked it out, I started enrolling in different courses one after another. The things that I totally like about Udacity courses are their:-\n\nI always wanted to enroll into a nanodegree from a long time but was not sure whether I should spend my money on it or not. Finally one fine day I just signed up for a free one-week trial and that\u2019s how my journey began.\n\nOnce I started pursuing Nanodegree, it was an awesome experience that I used to skip college and stay on it for more than 17 hours a day. The best part of nanodegree was that we had to create & submit projects. That feeling of creating something entirely by myself would boost my confidence levels. After every project there would be a detailed review and assessment of your project. These reviews were actually helpful as I got to know about butterknife library suggested by one of my project reviewers. I used to leave too many blanks in my code, these suggestions help improve my programming skills. This might be a small habit but then these small habits make more proficient and are useful once you start working in big IT companies.\n\nAnother exciting thing about Nanodegree is the networking opportunities and access to peer students communities through slack groups and discussion forums. You can discuss all your problems with fellow learners and get help instantly.\n\nSo, It was my one of best experiences so far. Looking forward to my next Nanodegree this summer now."

Meeting great minds in the same field and winning a handsome amount of money, didn\u2019t harm anyone.\n\nGo attend conferences, e.g. PyCon and meet other folks.

        "text": "2016 has not been the best year for job hunters and hiring managers alike. With the job market a little dicey, there is ONE thing most CXOs and CTOs agree on \u2014 companies are always hiring good engineers.\n\nWe at Udacity India interacted with thousands of learners, many of whom have successfully upgraded their career, and with the top tech companies in India.\n\nIt takes time and commitment to go through the drill. Lack of time is cited as the most common reason for drop-off among online learners. But as with most things in life, availability of time is a function of priorities. Best solution is to assess time availability in 2017 and allocate fixed time for learning anything new.\n\nMost successful professionals never stop learning new things and practicing what they have already learnt. For example, in a Udacity Nanodegree program, every concept is followed by quizzes and every lesson (group of concepts) is followed by projects. This has proven to be a much more effective way to learn a new skill, retain it and apply it in the context of a real world problem. In fact, most successful Udacity Nanodegree graduates continue to build on their personal portfolio of interesting projects beyond what they build as part of Nanodegree curriculum.\n\nNo amount of learning can cover the requirements of every hiring organisation. There will always be some specific stack, framework or system that you might not have covered and is used in the organisation you are applying to.\n\nThe best way to increase the hiring probability is to customise your preparation. Read the job description carefully, especially the \u201cgood to have\u201d section, which often contains information on actual technology or stack that the organisation is using.\n\nRead the blogs by the team members and organisation. They discuss culture and work environment. An informed conversation regarding the target employer, their technology stack, product or culture during the interview can help swing the vote in your favour.\n\nTry to find someone in your network who works for the organisation and try to know more about the company, product, work style etc..\n\nMost often, in absence of deep experience in the job skill you are switching to, interviewers rely on fundamentals to test technical capabilities. Algorithms and data structures are the most tested topics in tech interviews for development roles and same goes for Statistics concepts like P Value, Type or error, CLT etc. in data analysis interviews.\n\nApplying for a new job is a often a long process and getting selected for a desirable position takes more than just the technical skills. Quoting Mike Miller, a Udacity student, \u201cMarket yourself the most you possibly can. Apply for lots of different things. And do whatever you can to stand out and make an impression \u2014 put time into cover letters and follow up. Even if a job isn\u2019t the right fit, you never know who will remember you if something comes along that might be a better fit\u201d\n\nOn an average, a new job hunt requires at least 2\u20133 months of search and applications, and candidates apply for more than 15\u201320 positions to get more than a few interview calls.\n\nHave more questions or would like to contribute to the discussion? Come join us, for an AMA and the LAST live chat session of 2016 \u2014 where we talk about improving your Skill Index, cracking the employability code, how to prepare for the most in-demand jobs and what sets rockstar engineers apart."

        "text": "In our efforts to make learning more engaging, social and accelerated, we are launching the Udacity Co-Learn program. The program aims to create a close-knit network of Nanodegree students and foster collaborative learning.\n\nWe took inspiration and suggestions from the Udacity Communities. The community members suggested that learning with peers is motivating. It helps them set up commitments and fulfill them. Onwards there, comes in the Co-Learn program.\n\nThe program will have cohorts of Nanodegree students. Co-Learn will run through a series of meetups, where students will come together and do their Nanodegree. The meetups will be lead by facilitators who will help the students set up and achieve commitments.\n\nEach meetup will have a session on hiring trends by an industry expert. These sessions will help in providing an industry perspective to the students and give them an edge.\n\nThe Co-Learn will be a #100DaysOfNanodegree. Students will be learning and graduating from the Nanodegree in 100 days. This is competitive but we believe with a strong peer support, it can be achieved.\n\nThe program is open for new Nanodegree students and pilot run is in Bangalore. We soon plan to expand it further to other Udacity Communities as well. Current Nanodegree students can also join the meetups, and would make great mentors to new Udacians.\n\nWe strongly believe collaborative learning is going to make it easier for students to break through challenges. It\u2019s good to know others who are learning along and relate with them over the similar challenges that they face. Helping peers overcome shortcomings is a success. Overcoming a challenge with somebody is progress.\n\nReady to take the beautiful journey of learning with us and so many others like you? Sign up for the Co-Learn Cohort here."

        "text": "Technology is constantly upgrading itself to a better version. We also need to keep up with the change. Thus, learning never stops.\n\nAt Udacity, we continuously are revamping the courses and teaching techniques to keep up with changing trends. We come across students who have years of experience in the work industry and still continue to learn to keep themselves updated. Let\u2019s read more about Abhinav Tyagi.\n\nAbhinav has an experience of 8 years in the industry and 5 years of experience in Android. He is one of our Android Nanodegree student and a Top Forum Contributor.\n\nAn Electronics engineer, Abhinav ventured into programming in 2008 with Computer Science Corporation. He learnt Java programming and worked with Sun Microsystem. He came across, J2ME and it excited him to deploy and run the code on a mobile phone. It found it similar to deploying programs on hardware as back in college. Working on mobile programming was different from usual work of working on web services.\n\nAbhinav also started to devote extra time to initiatives running in the company. One of it was with Blackberry applications. He learnt the platform, developed application for the Blackberry Playbook. This won him a Playbook before the global launch of the product. Here onwards he received recognition in the office and started building applications for playbook. This got him many Blackberry devices and monetary rewards. Abhinav has various apps in the Blackberry Appworld.\n\nBetween 2010\u201311, Abhinav initiated the setting up of a Center of Excellence in CSC, Noida. This marked the setting up of first Center of Excellence outside USA. When CSC got Android projects he took them up because of his experience in Java.\n\nAbhinav learnt Android through the official documentation and stackoverflow. This is when, he switched his role and moved to Android development. He also developed various Android apps.\n\nIn 2013, Abhinav joined Genpact as a Principal Consultant. He researched for CVS Health and his implementation with Radius Networks was featured in Google I/O 2016.\n\nAbhinav got introduced to the Android Nanodegree with its announcement in the Google I/O.\n\n\u201cThrough the Nanodegree, I learnt many new concepts that I had never worked upon. I learnt various new techniques and best practices about the platform\u201d, says Abhinav.\n\nHe decided to take up the Nanodegree to get a well-structured knowledge of the platform. He also felt that through the Nanodegree he could fill in gaps he had in his experience with Android app development.\n\nAbhinav says, \u201cThe online course gives working professionals the flexibility to learn whenever they want to and at their own pace. Experience holders can skip the basics if needed. But the advance part of the course helps you catch up with the latest trends in the technology. There are many technical details and methods we do not encounter on a daily basis but they tend to make work easier and thus are good to be learnt\u201d"

We also come across stories of students who experiment with their careers to make them more interesting.\n\nNiharika Sharma has an amusing story. From being a Mechanical Engineer to a Human Resource Manager to becoming an Android Developer. Let\u2019s read more about her here -\n\nNiharika graduated as a Mechanical Engineer in 2013. She started her career in Mechanical Engineering but soon lost interest in pursuing it. She then moved to Bangalore in 2014 and started working in as an Human Resource Manager in a firm.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with recruitment and handling clients as and when required. But I was not satisfied at all. I used to talk to software engineers, as part of recruitment and soon started feeling like to be on the other side of the phone.\u201d, says Niharika.\n\nOne day while reading some articles in office, she came across an article on Bluetooth Smart. She was completely blown away by the fact that how Android is changing people\u2019s lives. Evolving from a simple operating system for smartphones, it is now powering smart watches, smart TVs, smart ACs and even satellite.\n\nNiharika says, \u201cThat was the moment when I realized I want to be a part of it too. I would love to develop something which can create a big impact on our day-to-day lives.\u201d\n\nAt this moment, Niharika started the search for a coaching to learn Android. This is when Udacity was introducing the Android Nanodegree in India. She considered online education because it would fit in flexibly with her work hours. The fact that the Android Nanodegree was co-created by Google was one big reason for her to look no further and begin her Android journey with Udacity.\n\nNiharika has no formal Computer Science degree or any knowledge of programming. This made it difficult to cope up in the beginning since everything was new. There were moments when she had to spend hours over one bug. But she aced through it with the help of discussion forums and 1-on-1s.\n\nInto her third month of the Android Nanodegree, Niharika started working as an Android developer for a Bangalore based startup."

        "text": "Opportunities, hidden under doubts and challenges wait for us to discover them. While we at Udacity discover opportunities to democratize education globally. It is inspiring to meet our students who are discovering many opportunities for themselves.\n\nOne such story is of Garima Aggrawal. Garima has just finished her second year of Computer Science engineering. She has graduate from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree (IPND). Also, is half-way through the Front-End Nanodegree.\n\nGarima is from Amritsar, Punjab. She is doing everything that a normal engineering student does apart from the fact that she is uncovering more and more opportunities everyday. It\u2019s common in engineering colleges for students to focus on getting a campus placement. Only few care about what they learn and what sort of jobs they finally end up in. Unlike many around her, Garima chose to build her career into computer science and programming. She wanted to take up something challenging.\n\nGarima and her parents believe that the world is competitive these days. Thus girls should be financially independent. It\u2019s important for girls to stay competent and at par with industry standards.\n\nGarima says, \u201cIt\u2019s my parents who were the key people to develop my interest in programming.\u201d\n\nHer mother who already had an experience in programming and logic building motivated her to learn programming. To pursue her career in programming, Garima joined a local coaching to learn C++. In the days to come, she read about Massive Open Online Courses. This is where she was introduced to Udacity.\n\nGarima decided to do the Intro to Programming Nanodegree. \u201cThe course looked pricey. But my parents insisted me to do it, considering the value it added to my profile\u201d, says Garima.\n\nShe found Python to be easier than C++. One of the IPND project required her to develop a Web Scrawler. She recalls making multiple iterations and submissions on this project. When her project finally matched expectations, she had built a real-time web scrawler.\n\nAfter graduating from Intro to Programming, Garima picked up Front-End Nanodegree. She wanted to learn more on developing websites. She was also suggested to go for the Front-End Nanodegree by her project instructor. Now she is half-way into the Front-End Nanodegree.\n\nOn learning about how Kelly got a job at Google, she got inspired to nail down a similar opportunity and is working towards turning that into a reality.\n\nGarima says, \u201cThe syllabus of online course is different than what we study in college. The online education is helping me create a portfolio to share it with my potential employers. Also, it\u2019s I can customize my study hours online so it does not affect my college academics in any manner.\u201d\n\nA huge fan of online education, Garima feels she would have been stuck tinkering around only C/C++ until now. She feels online education provides her a lot of exposure, which she would not have got in her college. Not just the knowledge she gets from the course but other online events like the Udacity Talks also provide her a bigger perspective of things."

        "text": "From learning Front-End development to becoming a Code Reviewer \u2014 the Adhyan Shrivastav story\n\nEfforts. Successive efforts. That is what takes to be growing. We make successive efforts to democratize education and make our students successful. We are talking about a similar story of successive efforts. Let\u2019s read about Adhyan Shrivastav -\n\nAdhyan joined Computer Science engineering at Jamia Milia Islamia University. What he did differently was to be aware of the industry trends, pick them up and execute them. He is entering his 7th semester of Engineering. He is already a Front-End Nanodegree code reviewer at Udacity and a Google Summer of Code intern with Mifos Initiative.\n\nAdhyan got introduced and interested in programming through competitive programming. He participated in competitive programming for 5\u20136 months. Then he realized that he wanted to build something meaningful from code.\n\n\u201cIn competitive programming you cannot see what you are building. I wanted to build something meaningful\u201d, quotes Adhyan.\n\nIn 2014, his sister told him about Udacity courses. He became a regular visitor at Udacity and learnt Python and Django. When Udacity launched the Nanodegree, he liked the its project-based approach. He then enrolled in the Front-End Nanodegree. He graduated in the Front-End Nanodegree in 3 months.\n\nNanodegree helped Adhyan get comfortable with large code bases. Helped him become better at handling codes that he is not familiar with. Adhyan says, \u201cThe Nanodegree taught me perseverance. I had to consistently work on the projects. It also played an important role in getting selected for the GSoC internship\u201d\n\nUpon graduation Adhyan received a mail asking for his interest in becoming a code reviewer at Udacity. Adhyan wanted to take up Code Reviewing to stay in touch with what he had learnt in the Nanodegree. As a code reviewer, Adhyan learnt new perspectives to solve the projects. It has also helped him become an efficient Technical and Non-Technical writer.\n\nOn selection process of Code Reviewers, Adhyan tells, \u201cThere are projects that a prospective code reviewer has to solve. The projects\u2019 difficulty level is according to the complexity of the project that somebody is applying for as a project reviewer. There is also a limit to the number of times an applicant can fail in these projects.\u201d\n\nAdhyan became a Udacity Front-End code reviewer in November 2015. He\u2019s been doing 15\u201320 code reviews per month in the past few months.\n\nAdhyan got introduced to Google Summer of Code by his seniors and got interested to apply in it. It was fascinating for him to know about a summer program where 18,000 developers applied and 1000 got selected. For Google Summer of Code, Adhyan started to contribute to Open Source in January 2016. He started fixing bugs for Mozilla Webmaker.\n\nLater he started working on the Mifos Initiative. He contributed to the Mifos\u2019 community app, where he did 2\u20133 bug fixes. He liked the community activity at the Mifos Initiative. Also the fact that, he was working towards building a meaningful product meant a lot to Adhyan.\n\nAdhyan had applied to work on the hybrid app of the organization. But, he got assigned to a different project in the internship. He had to work both on Front-end and Back-end. He had to learn new technologies for this. The Nanodegree and Open Source experience made it easy for Adhyan to adapt with new technologies quickly.\n\n\u201cWith just 1 week into the internship, I have learnt so much. I am excited to learn more about the developer community and how it works\u201d, says Adhyan about his GSoC internship.\n\nAdhyan came to know about the Android Developer Nanodegree from Sebastian Thrun\u2019s announcement about the Google and Tata Trust scholarship for India. Adhyan chose to learn Android development because it gave him a better edge in developing products. About his transition he says, \u201cTransition was smooth from web to mobile development. I found Android Nanodegree to be more challenging than the Front-end Nanodegree. It teaches all components about Android in depth.\u201d\n\nAdhyan quotes about online education, \u201cOnline education helps a person to be independent. Before learning online I did not know that I can learn myself. Also it develops skill-set apart from college education. Projects help you showcase what you know apart from theoretical knowledge.\u201d\n\nWith one year of engineering left, Adhyan is excited to work with a product-based company once he graduates as an engineer."

        "text": "With the world growing so quickly, all of us are working towards keeping ourselves updated and adapted. We met the ambitious Dhruv Bhatti, who is learning programming to adapt better with his field of work and expand his field of expertise. How are these two related you ask? Read on -\n\nDhruv is a 2nd year Electronics and Telecommunication engineering student from Mumbai. An Intro to Programming Nanodegree student, it was incidentally Dhruv\u2019s love of electronics got him into programming.\n\nBack in his school days, Dhruv found Computer Programming boring. He even dropped learning C++ before within two weeks of pursuing it. When in college, he had Java in his academic credits. But this wasn\u2019t taught well either.\n\nBeing an Electronics and Telecommunication student, Dhruv has worked on various electronics projects. His first project was the Smart Wifi which is an IoT-enabler tool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s application is only limited to your imagination\u201d, says Dhruv. To demonstrate the device\u2019s application, Dhruv connected it with a temperature sensor. The recorded temperature was automatically uploaded online and then we could see the data from anywhere in the world.\n\nDhruv could do the calculations for the projects but putting these calculations into a programming flow and programming them to work the way he wanted it to was problematic.\n\nRight after this project, Dhruv got fascinated with the power of programming and wanted to learn it better. He wanted to work on projects where he could program and make things work. Being introduced to Udacity by one of his relatives, Dhruv enrolled for Intro to Programming Nanodegree(IPND).\n\nNext up, Dhruv began his second electronics project \u2014 a speech recognition implementation with arduino. During this project he was familiar with how to use an Arduino but programming still perplexed him. Dhruv says, \u201cAs I moved ahead in IPND, I was able to understand the programs written by others. And I was happy because it was a big leap for me, from not being able to understand code to it becoming a simple thing for me.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Dhruv is working on an Autonomous Quadcopter using a Raspberry Pi and Python programming. He is confident about succeeding in this project because after learning python, he can easily program the Raspberry Pi and also understand the program flow better.\n\nSimultaneously, Dhruv is working on the Nanodegree\u2019s capstone project, where he is building an iOS application. He is also developing a website using Python for his mother\u2019s business on her birthday.\n\n\u201cWith no programming experience, the Nanodegree was difficult initially. I remember when I couldn\u2019t clear my project submission at first attempt. The reviewer was very humble and pointed my mistakes and there was a small video where they said there is no need to be demotivated as I can try again and learn more.\u201d, says Dhruv.\n\nDhruv says, \u201cBut with all this what makes me think that online education will change the way people learn. The exposure we get while learning is the best. Our classroom circle is bigger and we have students of all ages, who are ready to help each other and different stories of other peers motivate you a lot. Knowing that a person started with IPND after 30 years of experience in business is so amazing, because knowing this a person is ready to learn new things at that age then what\u2019s stopping me.\u201d\n\nDhruv is also starting the Udacity for College community in his college. He believes through UCollege everybody can learn and grow together. And also show his peers how powerful coding is and can help each other achieve their goals.\n\nThe journey of not being interested in programming to programming in python has got Dhruv very interested in Computer Science."

        "text": "Already know Android? The Android Nanodegree can still help! \u2014 the Shalini Puri story\n\nIn our time at Udacity India, we\u2019re seeing some interesting trends. So many of our Nanodegree students are those who already know a technology. iOS engineers, who take up the iOS Nanodegree. Experienced android engineers taking up the Android Nanodegree. Today\u2019s story is about one, who\u2019s the latter.\n\nShalini Puri is an Android Application Developer at Nagarro. She is Bachelors in Computer Science with about 5 years in Android application development. Owing to this, she took all of 2.5 months while simultaneously working at a full time job. She also received an offer from Flipkart, as a part of our interview-less hiring initiate!\n\nShalini was first introduced to Android back in 2010, when Android app development had started gaining popularity in the industry. Her knowledge of Java allowed her an easy switch to Android development. Initially Shalini learnt Android app development through the official Android documentation and Stackoverflow.\n\nWhen Shalini was introduced to the Android Nanodegree, she took the free trial for a week. She found great value in the course design and decided to go pursue the Nanodegree. Since she had prior experience in Android, she found the beginning of the course to be fairly simple. But as she progressed in the course, she learnt a lot of new things and found projects\u2019 difficulty level increased.\n\n\u201cWhen stuck in a problem I tends to use Google and Stackoverflow as the first approach towards the solution. If that doesn\u2019t work, I would consult another developer. And if I still can\u2019t find a solution, I sleep over it,\u201d she laughs.\n\n\u201cLooking at a problem with fresh eyes often helps me debug issues faster. I Design by Priority \u2014 I start with the main features first and then gradually start to work on the secondary features.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shalini, from the first online classes in 1989 to the present day, students are finding new life and career education opportunities online more than ever. \u201cStudents are embracing this format because of its flexibility, and instructors appreciate the versatility they provide,\u201d she says.\n\nShalini says \u201cThe project/code review is the best thing about the Nanodegree. I learnt many new things from reviewer\u2019s suggestions. Project reviews didn\u2019t just concentrate on functionality but taught her key concepts like app performance and how to design for the future. Career oriented projects specially resume and Linkedin profile reviews helped me a lot in finding a new job. Android interview dry run was very helpful in preparing for an interview\u201d.\n\n\u201cI actually got more than what I expected from this nanodegree. Getting call from Flipkart was a dream come true. I didn\u2019t really believe them until I got the offer letter. Getting an offer letter from a company like Flipkart without giving an interview is an amazing feeling.\u201d, she quotes.\n\nFurther, Udacity offered Shalini to work as Android project reviewer, which she currently does part time. This wasn\u2019t end of the success story. Shalini also received an offer from Nagarro with a promotion to her current job role.\n\nShalini loves to learn new things, that\u2019s why she started to pursue the Android Nanodegree. Currently she is learning HTML game development and after this she is planning to take up the senior web developer Nanodegree."

        "text": "10 startup lessons from the inventor of the iPod\n\nWhen Steve Jobs envisioned putting a 1000 songs in your pocket, one of the key people he turned to, was a design contractor \u2014 Tony Fadell. Over the years, Fadell designed the iPod and was later hired full time by Apple to oversee the design and production of the iPod and iSight devices.\n\nFadell would go on to co-founding a company that made energy efficient thermostats, Nest, which recently got acquired by Google for over 3 billion dollars. And now, at Google, he\u2019s designing the next iteration of Google Glass.\n\nUdacity hosted Tony Fadell last week in an hour long chat with our founder and chairman, Sebastian Thrun. This Q&A session saw Fadell come into his own and sharing valuable advice to technologists and entrepreneurs, drawn from being a top innovator for over 20 years in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere are 10 top pieces of advice from Tony Fadell -\n\n\u201cThe way I knew I wanted to go to school, is because of the roadblocks I kept meeting. Right from my high school days, I kept co-founding companies, which were engineering based, and I kept realising that I needed formal training. I think that\u2019s the right way to learn. You want to do something, go ahead and do it and learn the things that you need to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a startup company in Michigan, where I felt like I was big fish in a small pond. I had heard of Silicon Valley, and in my heart, I just knew that I had to be there and work with amazing people whom I can learn from. I literally knocked on the door of General Magic (an Apple spinoff), wearing a tie, asking them to hire me! And I eventually did get hired, only because I was persistent and the fact that I was a young guy, who had done things in programming. It was not because of my college degree, or my recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn this field, things keep evolving so fast \u2014 I started off writing programming programs in FORTRAN and COBOL and now you\u2019ve got things like JavaScript, Perl etc \u2014 you always have to continually learn. If you\u2019re in a well settled job, do Nanodegrees, because you have to constantly learn. This technology field moves very rapidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learnt this from Steve Jobs. People always went up to him and asked him, \u2018oh you could be doing so many things\u2019 and his main job was to say no to anything that wasn\u2019t absolutely important. You can only do something great, if you can focus your efforts, your emotions, your passion into the things that really matter, and that means saying no to many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften, engineers and designers, who\u2019re building B2C companies, design and build products and features that impresses the person next to them. That\u2019s geeky, but how does that make a difference to the common person who might want to use this product? As designers and engineers, it is our job to take powerful and robust software, and simplify it, so much so, that users feel like they have a new superpower they can use. Google is a great example. Your product team needs to always wear their beginners hats and think of how the end customer would look at this product.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeneral Magic was one of the biggest failures in Silicon Valley, because we spent 4 years building many features into a product. We lost a billion dollars in that time. And at the time, it\u2019s going to feel like the end of the world. But you need to focus on the future. There\u2019s a learning moment that happens during failure, and you need to project yourself in the future, and see what you can learn from here so this never happens again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI changed 15 schools in 12 years. This meant that I was never a master of my environment and I had to keep learning. And to keep learning, you need to be curious and to listen to others. Curiosity is one of the main ingredients for innovation. Keep asking questions, and you will learn. Also, you don\u2019t have to always take a course to learn. Most of our learning happens because of the people around us. Keep listening.\n\n\u201cWhen you run something by your parents, they are more often than not going to encourage you and tell you how great your idea is and how you\u2019re going to be awesome. That\u2019s not going to help. Ask your spouse! When I told my wife about NEST, she told me, \u2018that\u2019s nothing like an iPod!\u2019 But 5 minutes of explaining what we were trying to do, and she said \u2018I think that\u2019s a great idea!\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re starting a company, you need to know if you have the vision and the expertise to build what you want, but you also need a set of people who will help you get there. Through life, you\u2019re collecting experiences and making connections and these will help you build a better startup. Keep looking for different experience and keep learning. If you\u2019ve started up or worked at a startup, work at a bigger company and see what that\u2019s like. Even in a bigger company, don\u2019t just stick to the job that you\u2019re doing, keep talking to others. See what they\u2019re doing and that\u2019s how you learn.\n\n\u201cInnovation is a result of frustration and curiosity. Problems will frustrate you and you have to channel that frustration to figure out why you\u2019re feeling that way. Then curiosity kicks in and you start asking questions about why the problem exists in the first place. That will help you build a great product, and a great company. Don\u2019t do it for the money \u2014 do it because it a problem that frustrates you, and you\u2019re curious about it. That\u2019s the only way you can build a top startup."

        "title": "From a regular tech job to a cutting-edge data science career \u2014 the Soumya Ranjan Mohanty story",
        "text": "Soumya Ranjan Mohanty was an engineering student from Orissa, India, when the first MOOC was broadcast from Stanford in 2011. He couldn\u2019t know it then, but this would prove to be a pivotal moment in his life.\n\nA student of a government college in India, Soumya says, \u201cThe teaching infrastructure and faculty in my college weren\u2019t very good, and students were always on the the lookout for avenues to skill up.\u201d\n\nThis is Soumya\u2019s story, of how he went from being a \u201cregular\u201d engineering graduate to doing innovative work in data science, with the help of Udacity\u2019s Data Analyst Nanodegree program.\n\nLike many other Indian engineering graduates, Soumya got a job placement at an IT services company. He could certainly have settled into the role for the long-term, but his zeal for problem solving kept him on the lookout for more challenging work. \u201cI was really interested in the field of data science and I was looking for other opportunities.\u201d The growing presence of high-quality online education represented just such an opportunity.\n\n\u201cI had been following MOOCs since the first one by Sebastian Thrun on AI, and I had taken a lot of MOOCs while at college. Even now, there are so many people in my college who are taking up MOOCs to skill up. During an internship, I was introduced to data science and around the same time, Udacity launched its Data Analyst Nanodegree program.\u201d\n\nThe Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program covers topics such as statistics, machine learning, data wrangling and data visualisation. It generally takes 8\u201312 months to complete. Soumya, however, finished it in just four months. He says, \u201cBetween graduating from college and starting my job, I had a lot of time on my hands. I thought I could finish it in 3 months. But work started by then, so I had to take an extra month to do it.\u201d\n\nSoumya now works for Gramener, one of India\u2019s leading data visualisation startups. He credits Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree program with helping him land the job.\n\n\u201cWhen I was applying for jobs before the Nanodegree program, I usually got no responses as there wasn\u2019t any relevant work experience in my application. That changed after I earned my Data Analyst Nanodegree credential. The projects I worked on really helped me to build a strong resume, and the response I received after that was very good.\u201d\n\nThe company is engaged in a number of fascinating projects, including data visualisation projects for the government of India. (Check it out here)\n\nSoumya knows that pursuing a Nanodegree credential represents a number of challenges for people, including a financial one. \u201cI have encouraged a lot of my friends \u2014 many of whom are still in college \u2014 to enroll at Udacity. Some say that it is a little expensive, but I think the fact that I had paid money to enroll actually drove me to complete my program faster. Furthermore, I remind them that I got most of my money back, through Udacity\u2019s 50% tuition refund offer, and through my other work with Udacity as a reviewer.\u201d\n\nAs parting advice, Soumya shares what he thinks it takes to be a Nanodegree program graduate: \u201cIt takes discipline and consistency.\u201d"

        "title": "Actions speak louder than words \u2014 the Kushal Sharma story",
        "text": "At Udacity, we have great respect for those who have a zeal for learning and want to use what they\u2019ve learnt to have a positive impact on the world. Take Kushal for example \u2014 he\u2019s passionate about programming, and strongly believes that the Android platform will help him impact billions of lives.\n\nIt is this sort of passion that has helped Kushal work with a high impact company like Flipkart. Interesting bit of trivia \u2014 he also got this job without having to go through an interview!\n\nWant to know how? Read on -\n\nKushal is passionate about programming and learning new things every day. He loves to read and travel, and enjoy learning about math and philosophy. He enrolled in Android Developer Nanodegree because of his love to write programs and figured this was a great way to reach thousands of users.\n\nAccording to Kushal, Android is one of the best platforms to work on. He says, \u201cit has a huge open-source community and a user base of millions.\u201d Through the Nanodegree he also wanted to validate his online learning from blogs and tutorials. And the fact that this course is a collaboration with Google, made him take it even more seriously.\n\nKushal is a graduate in Computer Science from Delhi University. Prior to enrolling at Udacity, he was mostly working on his Android applications, some of which are published on Google Play Store. At the same time, Kushal was pursuing a Master\u2019s Degree from a university at New Delhi, but he only ended up completing the first year.\n\n\u201cThere was really nothing that excited me about going to a university. I cleared all my exams for the first year, but sticking to the university curriculum didn\u2019t feel like it would properly prepare me for the kind of work opportunity I wanted.\u201d, says Kushal\n\nKushal believes formal education is only needed until a certain point. He doesn\u2019t feel the need to study everything because on the off chance he might need it five to ten years down the line. He wants to learn the latest things, and to implement those things now. He wants to take on bigger challenges and find a way to solve them. Kushal loves to learn on the go. And he wants to train himself not only to write programs but to think like a programmer and learn new technologies as they evolve.\n\nSpending a lot of time online (often learning new things about programming) enabled Kushal to share ideas and access information that might require years to learn via classrooms and textbooks.\n\nAccording to Kushal, online education helped keep him updated with every new bit of tech that he wanted to learn. \u201cThere are no boundaries and no restrictions with the curriculum,\u201d he says.\n\nKushal was introduced to Udacity during the Google I/O \u2014 He says, \u201cfrom that moment on, I was completely excited about it!\u201d The Android Developer Nanodegree was a learning experience for him right from the beginning. Although he had already developed Android apps a year before enrolling in the Nanodegree, he found the learning curve to be exponential.\n\nHe credits the Nanodegree for helping him validate his approach towards writing Android applications. The Nanodegree encouraged him to push the limits and write code in new situations. This helped him gain experience and also exceed his own expectations!\n\nKushal admits that he found the Nanodegree program challenging. One challenge in particular he mentions, was with a project called Super Duo. The project contains half-written code for two applications and some user feedback. One needs to add the missing features in the app and fix the bugs from the given user reviews.\n\nHey says, \u201cI was never put in such a situation before and had to decide if I should rewrite the entire code or just make changes. It was such a valid real-life scenario that someone would face joining a new company. So I rewrote the code for the first application and made changes to the second application.\u201d\n\nThere were several times, he got stuck on almost every project. But the resources helped guide him through the struggles. These resources included Android documentation, Udacity forums, Stack overflow, Github and Udacity Google Plus groups.\n\nWhen Kushal started looking for a job, he focused on showcasing his projects and working on his Udacity profile. Kushal did not have to give any formal interview for Flipkart.\n\nKushal has recently joined Flipkart and is excited to work with the best teams on awesome projects. He is excited about the opportunity and aims to put all his efforts towards making the world a better place.\n\nUp next, Kushal plans to start with the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. It\u2019s something he has always been very curious about."

        "title": "3/8th Nanodegree = Internship \u2014 The Aagam Shah Story",
        "text": "While it is our aim to continuously work towards boosting hireability of our students by enhancing their skillset, there are stories that even surprise us. Take Aagam Shah for instance. He has got an internship with an Ahmedabad based startup, Interestship, as an Android Developer. While he credits this to the Nanodegree, he hasn\u2019t completed it yet. He is still on his third project (P3) of the Nanodegree!\n\nThe early days and the Udacity advantage\n\nCurrently a third year Computer Science Engineering student, Aagam first started learning on Udacity back in 2013. After his first course on Algorithms, he never stopped. He credits him being consistent with Udacity to the content quality and the platform UI.\n\nWhen you teach someone how to learn, that person can learn anything. More than the subjects they cover, MOOC\u2019s have motivated people to learn by themselves. A self-learner, Aagam believes that online education is changing the way people learn.\n\nTalking specifically about India, Aagam says, \u201ctraditional college education is just about theory. No practical applications are taught or encouraged in Indian universities. If you want to do it, you have to do it by yourself. The things that are used the most in industry like Github are never taught in a university. The only benefit of college education is that you get a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you are learning from industry experts you know you are in good hands. The knowledge you get from these lectures by experts can never be found in a book. Most courses I have seen follow a particular book but at Udacity you get to learn from the documentation itself. And that is a big plus because when in a job you got to know how to use the documentation. The best part is \u2018After you complete the course cake will be served\u2019 and I always got one,\u201d added Aagam.\n\n\u201cAt Udacity we learn by doing, and this helped me when I went for the interview. I was not asked any theory based questions. I showed the apps that I created in the Nanodegree to the interviewer. He asked me questions based on my apps. And I got selected!\u201d, he says.\n\nThere were many challenges that Aagam faced especially when he started the Nanodegree. He didn\u2019t know anything about Android. His first app it took him time as he had to do a lot of research to implement a specific functionality. At times he even missed the Nanodegree project deadlines, because he had to manage his college studies too. But these setbacks did not deter Aagam from pursuing his interest.\n\nIf not anything else, this Nanodegree has taught me how to face and overcome challenges.\u201d, quotes Aagam.\n\nAagam\u2019s dream from the beginning is to work at Google. And he feels that Nanodegree is bringing him a step closer to this dream."

        "title": "Interviewless hiring is real \u2014 The Anirudh Ramanan Story",
        "text": "At Udacity, our aim has always been to equip students with skills, which would help them do meaningful work. In the last 5 years, Flipkart has been doing some pathbreaking work in the field of e-commerce. It has the reputation of being a tech led company and is an aspirational brand for engineers across the India.\n\nAnirudh Ramanan was one of Udacity\u2019s success stories from our interviewless hiring deal with Flipkart. He\u2019s interning at Flipkart as a software developer, in their Android team, which he hails as one of the best teams at Flipkart.\n\nStill a 4th year, B.Tech (Computer Science) student from Galgotias University, Noida, he started programming out of interest. He says, \u201cI started with android development in my 2nd year of B.Tech. and I developed some basic apps for android, and published them in the Play Store.\u201d\n\nAnirudh\u2019s story is one that you hear about \u2014 from being interested in a technology and that interest leading to working with an industry pioneer.\n\nAnirudh credits Udacity with being more than an resource. He says, \u201cUdacity has been a tutorial partner for me from my early days of android programming. Opting for Android Nanodegree was one of the best decisions I have ever taken.\u201d Anirudh joined the course around July 2015.\n\nHe says, \u201cdue to my previous experience in Android, the early projects were easy for me. But from then on, each project was a learning experience for me. They motivated me to push my limits, and yes I ended up learning something new every single time.\u201d Anirudh finished I his course in just 22 days, spending around 12\u201313 hours a day for the course.\n\nHe says, \u201cthe good thing about online education is that you can learn whenever and wherever. Sometimes I would stay on Udacity courses till 5.00am. I truly think that online education can prove to be more useful than traditional offline education.\u201d\n\nLife after the Nanodegree and a surprise\n\n\u201cAfter graduating from Nanodegree, my life was back to the daily routine. Going to college and attending the ongoing placement sessions,\u201d says Anirudh.\n\nOne day around November 2015, Anirudh got a shocker \u2014 \u201cI got a call from Flipkart, that I have been selected for a 6 months internship program. I could not believe that it happened, that too without any interview. IT was a memorable moment that I can never forget.\u201d\n\nHe says, \u201cthe Udacity Nanodegree is up to date with the latest technologies in the market. The projects are challenging. There were times when I was completely stuck. But, there were plenty of online resources (Udacity Forums, stack overflows, the Udacity G+ group). These resources helped me to overcome those bottlenecks. The code reviews were also useful. The reviewers advised me for a better replacement libraries that I could have used in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most exciting project of the entire course was \u2018SuperDuo\u2019. This project had a list of user reviews, and the issues that the users were facing. The aim was to fix all the mentioned bugs, and to add any features that were missing. In my opinion, debugging and fixing bugs in a code that has not been written by you is more difficult than creating an app from scratch. This is one of the problem that anyone can face when he/she joins a new company,\u201d He says\n\nWhen asked about what he would do next, he says, \u201cas of now, I am excited about of my work at Flipkart, the current and future projects. As a next step, I am planning to join the Tech-entrepreneur Nanodegree course soon.\u201d\n\nAnirudh also loves contributing to open source projects.
