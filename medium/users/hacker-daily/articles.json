        "text": "Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a task not to be taken lightly. The startup or enterprise business must clearly understand the goal of doing it, the possible limitations and the need to build something AWESOME.\n\nLet\u2019s be frank: MVP, as we know it today, has drifted quite a long way aside from the concept initially proposed by Eric Ries in his The Lean Startup book around 7 years ago. The idea was to build a product with an absolute minimum of features, as a Proof of Concept, to ensure the main product idea is feasible and there is a market for it.\n\nSince then quite a lot of project managers fell for the fallacy of \u201cminimum viability\u201d of the product. Unfortunately, in waaay many cases this meant the sub-par quality of the design and limited functionality, as everything was sacrificed in order to implement several core features fast. This has lead us to the situation we witness today \u2014 where a plenty of poorly-built MVPs try to compete for the customer\u2019s attention in order to get the next round of funding and have enough resources to become fully-featured products.\n\nWhile being a somewhat depressing picture, this situation provides a unique opportunity for any fast-witted entrepreneur. All a startup needs to do to win the hearts of their audience is provide a well-designed and smoothly performing product with essential features and one (or two) GREAT bonuses that allow the product to stand out from the competition.\n\nYes, designing and developing an awesome feature will need some time and resources. However, it is better to do the things slowly and end up with a high-quality product than add another meager offer to the line of wannabe successes.\n\nThis all applies to entering the densely populated market, of course. When there are zero alternatives, as you try to conquer the underserved market niche, your MVP will be awesome because it will be unique. In that case, you need just to implement the core functionality that solves the customer\u2019s pain and provide smooth UI/UX. This way you will provision a Proof of Concept that will ensure there will be a demand for a fully-featured product.\n\nIt is quite obvious the software developers have to make trade-offs from time to time. However, we think product quality should not be sacrificed at any cost. If you are building an MVP \u2014 just make sure it solves the real-world pain it is intended to solve and does so with style. Include fewer features, but make them run smoothly and provide an AWESOME user experience. This way your product will test the market, gain positive feedback and cause the needed traction to ensure the target audience is willing to buy a full-scale product you will deliver in some time.\n\nWhat do you think of the concept of adding some awesomeness to an MVP? Do you follow the same concept while creating your products? Please share your experience below!"

        "title": "Facial Emotion Detection using AI: Use-Cases \u2013",
        "text": "Sentiment Analysis is already widely used by different companies to gauge consumer mood towards their product or brand in the digital world. However, in offline world users are also interacting with the brands and products in retail stores, showrooms, etc. and solutions to measure user\u2019s reaction automatically under such settings has remained a challenging task. Emotion Detection from facial expressions using AI can be a viable alternative to automatically measure consumer\u2019s engagement with their content and brands.\n\nAt ParallelDots, we have combined the science of psychology, human expressions and artificial intelligence to recognize different emotions on an individual\u2019s face automatically. Our facial emotion detection algorithm can identify seven different type of emotional states in real-time.\n\nIn this post, we will discuss how such a technology can be used to solve a variety of real-world use-cases effectively.\n\nCar Manufacturers around the world are increasingly focusing on making cars more personal and safe for us to drive. In their pursuit to build more smart car features, it makes sense for makers to use AI to help them understand the human emotions. Using facial emotion detection smart cars can alert the driver when he is feeling drowsy.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation claims that driving-related errors cause around 95% of fatal road accidents. Facial Emotion Detection can find subtle changes in facial micro-expressions that precedes drowsiness and send personalized alerts to the driver asking him to stop for a coffee break, change music or temperature.\n\nA candidate-interviewer interaction is susceptible to many categories of judgment and subjectivity. Such subjectivity makes it hard to determine whether candidate\u2019s personality is a good fit for the job. Identifying what a candidate is trying to say is out of our hands because of the multiple layers of language interpretation, cognitive biases, and context that lie in between. That\u2019s where AI comes in, which can measure candidate\u2019s facial expressions to capture their moods and further assess their personality traits.\n\nNotably, Unilever is already starting to incorporate this technology into their recruitment process. With this technology, a recruiter will be able to know, say, the overall confidence level of an interviewee and make a decision about whether or not this candidate will be able to perform well at a client-facing job. Similarly, it will be possible to find whether the candidate is honestly replying to all the questions by measuring the change in emotions during his responses and correlating it the vast amount of knowledge available in this area.\n\nEmployee morale can also be perceived using this technology by holding and recording interactions on the job. As an HR tool, it can help not only in devising recruiting strategies but also in designing HR policies that bring about best performance from employees.\n\nVideo games are designed keeping in mind a specific target audience. Each video game aims to evoke a particular behavior and set of emotions from the users. During the testing phase, users are asked to play the game for a given period and their feedback is incorporated to make the final product. Using facial emotion detection can aid in understanding which emotions a user is going through in real-time as he is playing without analyzing the complete video manually.\n\nSuch product feedback can be taken by analyzing a live feed of the user and detecting his facial emotions. While feelings of frustration and anger are commonly experienced in advanced video games, making use of facial emotion detection will help understand which emotions are experienced at what points in the game. It is also possible that some unexpected or undesirable emotions are observed during the game. Taking feedback from the user has experienced the game can be inefficient. This is because it can often be difficult to put an experience into words. Moreover, users may be unable to remember what exactly they went through emotionally across different parts of the game. Facial Emotion detection is a practical means of going beyond the spoken or written feedback and appreciating what the user is experiencing. When feedback is taken in this format, it becomes genuinely non-intrusive when it comes to user experience. At the same time, such feedback is more reliable than other forms.\n\nTraditionally, market research companies have employed verbal methods such as surveys to find the consumers wants and needs. However, such methods assume that consumers can formulate their preferences verbally and the stated preferences correspond to future actions which may not always be right.\n\nAnother popular approach in market research industry is to employ behavioral methods that observe user\u2019s reaction while interacting with a brand or product. Such methods are considered more objective than verbal methods. Behavioral methods use video feeds of users interacting with the product which are then analyzed manually to observer their reactions and emotions. However, such techniques can quickly become very labor intensive as the sample size increase. Facial Emotion Recognition can come to the rescue by allowing market research companies to measure moment-by-moment facial expressions of emotions (facial coding) automatically and aggregate the results.\n\nDetecting emotions with technology is a challenging task, yet one where machine learning algorithms have shown great promise. Using ParallelDots\u2019 Facial Emotion Detection API, customers can process images, and videos in real-time for monitoring video feeds or automating video analytics, thus saving costs and making life better for their users. The API is priced on a Pay-As-You-Go model allowing you to test out the technology before scaling up.\n\nFacial Emotion detection is only a subset of what visual intelligence could do to analyze videos and images automatically.

        "title": "WHY I LOVE SNAPCHAT \u2013",
        "text": "This post was posted on May 26, 2016 on my previous blog, that now doesn\u2019t exist. A lot changed since then and instagram stories are BIGGGG!\n\nUnless you\u2019ve lived under the rock, you heard about Snapchat. You know that \u2018small\u2019 startup that captures things that immediately disappear. \u2018What a crazy idea\u2019? is a typical reaction, followed by confusion why would anyone use that. Because it was about capturing moments for our parents and grandparents. It was all about having something to show in future.\n\nYear ago I didn\u2019t think I would ever wrote that kind of post. I was in the camp of capture moments forever, to show future generations. But couple months of playing and I was hooked. I saw advantages over the conventional social networks. Yes, Facebook, I am talking about you \ud83d\ude09\n\nI present you things that made me fall in love with Snapchat. I don\u2019t know if it was original idea behind this app, but in my case it works that way and that\u2019s why it\u2019s awesome.\n\nThere is something intimate about sending and watching snaps. You are getting inside people life, especially with videos. You are there in the moment, in those 10 seconds, to be part of event they take part. It\u2019s completely different interaction than feed. You are not scrolling through hundreds of posts, which are mostly ads or new posts from Facebook page you liked years ago. The experience is just smoother and you are more engaged, because it doesn\u2019t feel like you get the stuff that everyone gets. Think about future of technology, try to visualize Snapchat VR. Overall, it just appeals to human curious nature.\n\nMy friends who don\u2019t own account are quite surprised when I tell them there are no likes. How do you know you don\u2019t post shitty things, which people hate? As a user of Facebook and Instagram I found myself sometimes deleting thing if they didn\u2019t get any attention(likes). You won\u2019t delete posts if you have no idea how good they are doing. That makes you also more active and less caring about how much to post. There is also another benefit of lacking this particular feature. When people respond to something on typical social network, they get closure, they gave reaction or comment as a part of group and case closed. Just think for a second about times you were asked in REAL LIFE about your snap vs. facebook post.\n\nNo photoshopping.\n\nNo careful selection from 1000 shots.\n\nNo special effects and countless filters to choose from.\n\nNo montage.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t show distorted reality you are used to on other apps. That still is such small slice of life of person but you don\u2019t have to own expensive equipment, software to succeed in making cool clips of your life. Having limited possibilities suddenly makes you more creative.\n\nSnapchat encourages you to enjoy life. It\u2019s hard to create good snapchat account by just sitting in front of computer or bathroom mirror. You have to go outside, meet with friends, go to some music concert or sport event. You have to be constantly in lookout for adventure.\n\nIt\u2019s something that other apps miss. They would love you to be there in front of screen posting pictures of cats or latest Game of Thrones spoiler. Snapchat doesn\u2019t feel like he want to chain you to phone and make you prisoner of sweet digital reality."

        "title": "Technology Trends Rise and Fall in Waves \u2013",
        "text": "As one new innovation grows more powerful and popular, another begins to die out. We don\u2019t see many horse-drawn carriages around for a reason. People drive cars now.\n\nUntil autonomous vehicles come to rule the roads, that is.\n\nMany people become overwhelmed as the regular cycle of tech waves crashes over them again and again. But one way to keep this from happening is by creating a structure or framework you can continually add new pieces of data.\n\nThat\u2019s one way to think about it. If you have a framework in your mind on which you can hang individual facts, then you\u2019re able to see all of the data in context \u2014 the big picture.\n\nThe more your knowledge is organized into frameworks and models, the better you get at making sense of news, facts, data, and other information that is continually bombarding you. From there, it\u2019s easier to incorporate this information into your thinking.\n\nCarlota Perez, currently Centennial Professor at London School of Economics, researched the major technological disruptions since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nAnd she found there are two phases to every tech revolution.\n\n1. First comes the installation phase, beginning with \u201cirruption\u201d and leading to \u201cfrenzy.\u201d In the installation phase, the technology makes it to market, people begin investing, and the infrastructure is built.\n\nThen comes the crash.\n\nExpectations were too high. People invested too much too soon. The frenzy simply can\u2019t be sustained, and the market corrects. In the long run, the crash actually helps, because it leads to the second phase.\n\n2. The second phase is known as deployment. It\u2019s characterized by two periods known as \u201csynergy\u201d and \u201cmaturity.\u201d In this phase, people are more realistic about the opportunities presented by the technology, and they\u2019ve figured out how to profit from it through dependable business models.\n\nThe internet is a good example from recent history.\n\nIrruption and frenzy occurred in the 90s, leading to the Dotcom Bubble and eventually the Dotcom Crash in 2000. But afterwards, people got a grip on how to work with the technology and invest prudently. As the internet grew into its synergy and maturity phases, huge companies were born.\n\nElectricity, motor vehicles, rail transport, and many other technological revolutions have gone through the cycles in Carlota Perez\u2019s model.\n\nIt fits many technology cycles in medicine and science as well. Take gene therapy, for example. It started out with so much promise. My sister\u2019s middle school science fair project in the mid-1980s was entitled \u201cThe advent of gene therapy\u201d, but there were all kinds of disappointments (the deal of Jesse Gelsinger at University of Pennsylvania in 1999) that caused people to abandon it. But here we are, years later, and it looks as though gene therapy is getting increasingly closer to a golden age.\n\nEven our drug development work at Morphic Therapeutic fits into the framework. The integrin class of receptors we\u2019re targeting was discovered by our founder, Tim Springer, back in the 80s. And initially, there was plenty of investment in it.\n\nBut using that discovery to create a small molecule drug turned out to be much harder than anyone anticipated. The bubble burst, and many of the largest pharmaceutical companies left the field. It took another decade of research, but now we\u2019ve figured out many of the technical issues that led to the failures. And we\u2019re poised to create a new generation of drugs that would have been impossible before. I\u2019d say we\u2019re somewhere in the deployment stage at this point, hopefully trending towards maturity. This is the portion of the Carlota curve where you hit the \u201caccelerator.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an expert in a certain subject to understand where a given technology lies within the framework.\n\nWhen you come across a new technology or discovery, ask yourself where it fits into this model. Is it in the installation or deployment phase? How far into that phase? Why do you think so? Are there arguments for placing it somewhere else?\n\nThe purpose of this exercise is to put a stake in the ground somewhere. Your assessment is never going to be perfect. But asking these questions gives you insight into whether you should act on a particular piece of information.\n\nShould you bet your career on an investment if it looks like the technology is in the frenzy stage of installation? Maybe, but at least you will realize the forces at work. There are a different set of risks at the various different stages.\n\nIt won\u2019t provide you with an 100% accurate answer, but it will help you develop some important insight by placing things in a framework you can understand."

        "title": "QuarkChain Review \u2014 A New Scalable Blockchain Looking to Dethrone Ethereum?",
        "text": "QuarkChain supports smart contracts with the use of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), sharded blockchains therefore run their own smart contracts local to their blockchain via EVM.\n\nSharded blockchains can be thought of as mini-Ethereum\u2019s or clones of Ethereum running simultaneously and parallel to one another with unique individual wallets associated to them.\n\nSo for sharded blockchain 1, you will also have wallet 1, and on sharded blockchain 2 there is wallet 2, and so forth\u2026 As you can imagine it would be a hassle to keep track of these wallets, especially if there are a hundred or even thousands of these sharded blockchains, which is why QuarkChain offers the following two features:\n\nIn QuarkChain users are able to use a single \u201cPrimary Account\u201d where the majority of the user\u2019s funds will be parked for them to manage all other wallets. When a user wants to send funds to a different sharded blockchain the user simply sends it from their Primary Account.\n\nPrimary account sending transactions to wallets located in other sharded blockchains\n\nThe Primary Account is combined with a \u201cSmart Wallet\u201d to automatically handle \u201ccross\u201d-shard transactions, these \u201ccross\u201d-shared transactions can be made anytime and are confirmed within minutes.\n\nQuarkChain is a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain that uses an ASIC-resistant PoW. The rootchain reaches consensus via PoW with each sharded blockchain following a \u201crootchain first\u201d consensus to deal with forks.\n\nDue to the two-layered system an advisor would need to first revert transactions (or block headers) on the root+chain in the second layer before they can attempt to revert transactions made on the sharded blockchain level.\n\nIn an early prototype, QuarkChain sharded blockchains were able to confirm blocks in 10 seconds and the rootchain confirmed blocks within 2.5 minutes.\n\nAs each blockchain in the network offers a different level of mining reward and difficulty, this allows miners to choose which blockchain to mine to achieve the best level of returns given their hash power.\n\nThis creates an open market for mining where the blockchains act as sellers touting block rewards, with miners buying block rewards with hashing+ power as their currency.\n\nQuarkChain\u2019s mining difficulty algorithms are designed so there is at least 50% of total hash power allocated to the root blockchain at all times with the remaining 50% being evenly distributed among sharded blockchains.\n\n50% of total hash power from miners is allocated to the root blockchain with the remaining 50% evenly distributed between the sharded blockchains\n\nA malicious user looking to attack QuarkChain requires at least 25% of the network\u2019s total hash power, which is less than the 51% required for Bitcoin.\n\nRecording and keeping track of ALL transactions for a blockchain is resource intensive; doing this for a high-throughput blockchain is even more so.\n\nUnfortunately this is how most blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum function with miners who take on the role of \u201cfull nodes\u201d.\n\nFor a high-throughput blockchain performing 500,000 transactions per second, these transactions would add up to requiring 10 terabytes of data to be stored each day by miners and an internet bandwidth of at least 1GB per second.\n\nMiners capable of such demanding requirements would likely only be commercially ran mining operations and so the high amount of throughput would lead to the centralization of miners with the smaller miners taking their hashing power elsewhere.\n\nThis is why QuarkChain incorporates the concept of \u201cclustering\u201d miners so that mini-nodes are able to work together in order to create a full node.\n\nFull-nodes (represented by blocks on the left) are replaced by a cluster of mini-nodes\n\nEach mini-node within a cluster works to validate a subset of blockchains and then bands together to share what they\u2019ve validated to form the complete picture of all transactions that have occurred throughout the network.\n\nJumping back to our banking account analogy, a full node can be considered as having the complete picture of all bank accounts held by a bank including all the transactions that have been made for each account.\n\nA mini-node however only has a snapshot of the first hundred bank accounts and their related transactions, with a second mini-node covering the next hundred and so forth.\n\nIn order for mini-nodes to understand what\u2019s happening in ALL bank accounts, they have to come together and share what they know to form the complete picture and make up a full node.\n\nYou can imagine just how difficult it would be for one accountant to keep track of all the different bank accounts and the transactions happening throughout. Splitting up the accounts and spreading them out over several accountants however makes the task a lot more manageable.\n\nIn the case of miners, this means the total amount of data that a miner has to store is far less than what they would be required to store if they had to operate as a full node.\n\nLeft: A cluster of mini-nodes A, B, and C each validate transactions from a subset of R: rootchain, S0: Shard 0 blockchain, and S1: Shard 1 blockchain.\n\nRight: The mini-nodes work together in a cluster to create a full-node. Even if one of the mini-nodes is offline the cluster can still form the complete picture of R, S0, and S1.\n\nQuarkChain currently has a private testnet live that is operating with 8 sharded blockchains with each shard performing 100 to 200 transactions per second (TPS). The total TPS for the network currently ranges from 1000 to 2000+ transactions per second."

        "title": "Servicebot Open-Source v0.9: Webhooks, Payment Scheduler, Major UI Changes",
        "text": "We are happy to announce our v0.9 release for Servicebot, an open-source subscription management platform. This article will show you the latest additions to the platform and how to get the most value out of your Servicebot.\n\nSince we started Servicebot last year, our goal has been to create an open-source platform that takes a service-oriented approach to subscription management. This approach allows for complete control over the different steps of the subscription lifecycle.\n\nIn this release, we have finished our custom payment scheduler as well as made major changes to the UI and the internals of Servicebot.\n\nFor full release notes, check out our GitHub.\n\nSince we added pluginbot to Servicebot back in September of 2017, we have slowly been migrating functionality from a monolithic architecture into a more service-oriented plugin architecture. We plan on eventually migrating all the code from the monolith to plugins, as well as allowing the plugin system to be controlled from the front-end, as commonly seen in CMS like Wordpress or Drupal.\n\nIn this release we added a file manager plugin, which we are using in production to push uploads such as logos or user avatars to S3 instead of the filesystem.\n\nThere is now an option to send event data to integration points such as Jenkins, Zapier, or your own applications. These events will allow you to tap into the service lifecycle of Servicebot.\n\nA SaaS business has a free trial registration form on their website which, when requested, will create an account in their app and attach an access token to the response so they can be logged in.\n\nUsing Servicebot to manage their subscriptions, they can easily have a webhook connect to their app, or build automation service such as Jenkins. This will allow for service lifecycle events, in this case a \u201crequested\u201d event which triggers whenever a new subscription is requested. Going further, the \u201ccancellation\u201d and \u201ctrial expiration\u201d events can trigger app access to be restricted until they add a funding source.\n\nWith this latest release we added a new feature for allowing much more customizable payment plans. Here\u2019s how it works \u2014 First, you set the billing type of a service to be \u201cscheduled payments,\u201d then you can set the number of payments desired, when each payment should occur, and the amount each payment should be.\n\nThere are two main points to building this feature: The ability to split up a one-time payment into multiple payments, and the ability to have a more flexible payment structure.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are a business that provides a $6,000 consulting service over three months. The obvious choice would be to split up that payment into a monthly $2,000 payment over three months. But with Servicebot, you can tweak how much each payment should be. An easier sell to a potential customer would be making that first payment at $1000, giving them a chance to \u201ctry out\u201d your service for a month before committing to the more expensive second and third month payments of $2,500.\n\nThere are three major UI changes in the version 0.9 release. Each change was developed based on feedback and analytics.\n\nWe improved the way customers interact with the request forms to be more embeddable and more in line with how an invoice looks, as well as making the request form easy to embed in any existing site for a seamless customer experience."

        "text": "How music and cryptocurrency have more in common than you think\n\nWhile on a flight to Taipei I was watching The Defiant Ones again. For those who haven\u2019t seen it, this is the four part documentary on Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, the music icons and creators of Beats By Dre (sold to Apple for $3 Billion). In one section Jimmy starts talking about realising the music business was in trouble once he saw how easily people were trading MP3s on websites and then through services like Napster.\n\nThat got me thinking that we often draws parallels of blockchain/cryptocurrency to the beginning of the Internet. But not enough is made of its similarities to the music business, which I think is far more fascinating. Let\u2019s go through some:\n\nAround the year 2000, when music was at its absolutes sales peak, there were four major record labels. Those four had sub-labels underneath that they also partly owned. So even though the public thought there were hundreds of labels and they were supporting entrepreneur driven labels like Maverick, Interscope, Bad Boy, etc; the money was rolling up to those four and the labels were under their control.\n\nProbably the biggest benefit that everyone likes about cryptocurrency is that it frees up control from centralised parties. Poorer countries are angry their governments can de-value their currencies and keep printing more.\n\nDuring The Defiant Ones, Jimmy goes to Doug Morris (head of one of the big four labels, Universal) and tells him what\u2019s going on with MP3s and that their business is over. Doug Morris is an experienced music mogul who has done well from their existing business model. Doug, assuming their cartel-like model can ever be brought down, just dismisses it. Then Jimmy and the rest of the music industry go on the attack that it\u2019s theft and piracy and begin bashing the very fans that made them super wealthy.\n\nThis is comparable to the current parties in control of the financial world saying cryptocurrencies are a scam, are used for illegal activities and painting a negative brushstroke over the community.\n\nOnce anti-piracy messages and pleas from groups like Metallica failed to resonate, people began building new products for the music business. The ringtone era exploded at one point and allowed artists to monetise their songs. Streaming services have become the norm with multiple companies becoming publicly listed. Live events for concerts and electronic music festivals are at new highs as people want that different experience. EDM may never have become mainstream unless it was easy for people to hear the music and remixes of their favourite pop and hip-hop records.\n\nOver the past two years the growth of Bitcoin and Ether have allowed for new business models to start building which cover everything from investment platforms to infrastructure technologies and a better form of the Internet.\n\nSo what does all this tell us? It says that no matter what the powers in control do or say, people will continue to use products that make their lives easier, this is whether its a MP3 or cryptocurrency. And more the higher ups bash and fight against it, people\u2019s natural tendencies is to rebel and keep pushing forward. The ones in financial control should learn from Jimmy when he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guy who sold the last CD\u201d."

        "text": "This is the second installment of a long form essay \u2014 or short book \u2014 outlining my macro perspective on how the emerging crypto ecosystem fits within the greater context of biological, cultural, and economic evolution. I intend to publish each installment weekly, over a period of 3\u20134 weeks. Afterward, I\u2019ll release the content in its entirety, with additional notes and research materials, in e-book form.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already read the first installment in this series, you should read it before continuing with this article, as each installment builds upon earlier concepts.\n\nThe first installment in this series ended with a series of questions underscoring the difficulties that arise when we attempt to pin down precisely what money symbolizes:\n\nThe simplistic answer to these questions, as framed by most economists, is that money is a tool used to represent, compute, transact, and store economic value over time. But this definition has always troubled me, as it relies upon the a priori abstraction of value as something best represented homogeneously \u2014 as if for the sake of efficiency we must inevitably discard the cornucopia of unique values held within each of us. For expedience, economists say, we must pack our human values into singular numerical prices. Yet the majority of economic literature says little of worth about why we should \u2014 in the first place \u2014 treat our human values in this manner.\n\nAfter all, each individual faces a unique set of constraints as they move throughout the world, and each of us must apply our own values to an unpredictable series of life events in a way that increases our chances of satisfying our own path-dependent needs and desires over time. We may of course generalize these paths, but only to a point. Past this point we begin to feel a sense of detachment between money and our perceived reality; the aforementioned illusion of representation begins to come unglued. Furthermore, the psychological schism between abstract monetary symbols and our perceived reality widens as symbols fail to keep pace with the exploding complexity of our lived experiences. And as the schism widens, those consumed by its depth feel skepticism concerning the system of value representation itself (market capitalism), and many begin to despise its pervasive totems of value (monetary symbols).\n\nBut this is nothing new. The motif of value\u2019s inherent contingency crops up throughout the history of recorded human thought, dating at least as far back as Plato and Aristotle. For example, in Aristotle\u2019s Politics, he notes that too much of a good thing can become a bad thing, contingent upon circumstance:\n\nTwo millennia later \u2014 confronted by a rapidly evolving industrial world and struggling to retrofit existing theories of value onto a fundamentally novel economic reality \u2014 Adam Smith once again surfaced the timeless problem of value\u2019s contextual subjectivity with his Diamonds and Water Paradox:\n\nYet this only presents a paradox if one assumes that goods or services possess some inherent value outside the physical and social systems in which they\u2019re embedded. In practice, the value of goods and services depend \u2014 in a phenomenological sense \u2014 upon the specific circumstances, needs, and psychological states of market participants, in addition to the overall energy required to bring them to market. This ambiguity regarding value\u2019s singular source eventually found itself co-opted by political factors, and evolved into the Labor Theory of Value, which concluded that the value of a thing hinged mainly upon the labor invested in producing it.\n\nBut as economic theories will, the Labor Theory had its weaknesses. Richard Whately \u2014 a 19th-century British economist \u2014 demonstrated one such weakness by inverting the labor-centric perspective, and highlighting the cyclical relationship between the perceived value of goods and the extent to which these perceptions drive behavior:\n\nThough this once again begs the question: why do the pearls fetch a high price in the first place? It seems we\u2019ve traveled a circular path back to where we began, and again must confront the eternally frustrating question: what is value?\n\nTo avoid the impossibly complex task of centrally calculating why all humans value the things they do, relative to their unique life situations and value systems, we coined the word utility, and ascribed to it the amount of value encoded by a market participant\u2019s willingness to sacrifice one thing for another. In this manner we defined our way out of the circular trap discussed above, and (at least temporarily) skirted the utopian temptation to pursue the omniscient calculation and centralized planning of complex economic systems.\n\nAnd so today we make constant sacrifices to one another in the form of money. Economists call the specific amount of money we\u2019re willing to sacrifice to one another for each additional unit of a good or service its marginal utility. For example, if I\u2019m hiking through the desert and I\u2019ve run out of water, the initial marginal utility of one water bottle far exceeds that of a diamond. Furthermore no amount of diamonds changes the equation, as a diamond won\u2019t quench my thirst. I\u2019d happily pay for as much water as I could carry, past which point its marginal utility drops to zero. Alternatively, if I\u2019m well-hydrated and safely ensconced within a society that uses diamonds as symbols of access to other scarce resources \u2014 or am involved in a relationship in which my partner expects such a gift as a token of commitment \u2014 the marginal utility of a diamond far exceeds that of water. Beyond this first diamond, however, the marginal utility of more diamonds becomes highly contingent upon a number of other variables \u2014 namely one\u2019s interpersonal negotiation skills and tolerance for loneliness\u2026\n\nIn any case, by introducing marginal utility we sidestep the apparent circularity of value, and gain a functional definition of monetary value that encapsulates the differences in perceived value which arise from one\u2019s unique circumstances. This abstraction alleviates inconsistencies within our economic formalisms, but given our present purpose only drives the question of fundamental value one layer deeper into humanity\u2019s behavioral substrata. One then ponders why pieces of paper or metal that embody this monetary value represent a sufficient sacrifice \u2014 from the perspective of the owners of goods or providers of services \u2014 to justify parting with one\u2019s possessions or labor? Why would someone give you something that you can enjoy now (food, water, property, jewelry) in exchange for abstract tokens of value?\n\nOne reason might be their ability to use those tokens to purchase other goods or services \u2014 absent here and now \u2014 at a future time and place. But this story is merely descriptive, and takes for granted the collective knowledge necessary to encode such an idea within the minds of a collective\u2019s individuals. How did societies come to learn and appreciate the self-organizing power of this behavioral pattern? To answer that question, and to furthermore understand money\u2019s importance as an evolutionary paradigm shift, we must dig deeper into the sub-structure of how humans first came to accept symbols of value in place of concrete goods or services. And for that we\u2019ll need to hop into our time machine and travel further back than any of our economic, philosophical, or historical texts can take us: to the emergence of humanity itself.\n\nMoney-like collectibles are nearly as old as humanity itself. Let that sink in for a minute. Our ancestors used physical objects \u2014 shells, bones, knotted cords, etc. \u2014 to represent and abstract the concepts of value long before any large-scale civilizations entered the scene. This cuts against the grain of common knowledge, which purports that money emerged from transactional barter systems. But evolutionary anthropologists question the idea that barter \u2014 as described by 18th and 19th century economists like Smith \u2014 ever existed as a primary mechanism of exchange amongst pre-agrarian societies.\n\nRather, these early societies embedded the exchange of valuables within the connective psycho-social tissue of shared memories and values, and stored their record \u2014 in holographically distributed fashion \u2014 within the brains of the community. Such systems of exchange were deeply entwined and in touch with the specifics of cultural and geographic necessity, and provided a mechanism for tributary relationships and socially-computed reciprocity. For example, we possess no evidence that humans living in small-scale arrangements ever engaged in purely transactional behaviors such as trading 3 pigs for 1000 bananas within a market. Instead, informal mechanisms of tracking contribution and reciprocity across time prevailed. For example, when a community member encountered the misfortune of an unsuccessful hunt, those in possession of excess bananas would cut them some slack (edible credit, so to speak), as they remembered the delicious pig roast provided by the hunter last month. In other words, we haven\u2019t always abstracted our economic reality away from the social landscape in which we\u2019re eternally embedded. Yet eventually we did. Why?\n\nMany in the crypto \u2014 and broader tech \u2014 community are already quite familiar with the answer: scaling issues. In the case of early value representations stored in human memory, scaling issues were rampant. Human memory is fundamentally limited. Its encoding mechanisms are fuzzy (telephone game), not very durable (we forget things), and prone to catastrophic failure events (death, or the occasional head trauma). Also, reliance upon memory is subject to the incentives of those doing the remembering, who might conveniently mis-remember the deliciousness of your roast pig when you later come around asking for bananas. How to solve these issues?\n\nWe did what large-brained humans do best: we created abstractions to represent, and tools to solve the problem at hand. Instead of relying purely upon our memories, we began to exchange pieces of bone from rare prey, traded aesthetically pleasing stones, or tied knots into complex arrangements representing meaningful events. It\u2019s critical to understand that while this level of abstraction provided a tremendous degree of utility, it remained closely bound to the specific values, aesthetics, and traditions of a given society. However, as we started to encode information into these systems rather than storing it in our minds, a degree of separation began to emerge between the complex landscape of our internal representation of lived experiences and the increasingly externalized mechanisms of representing, storing, and exchanging symbols of value.\n\nThis process of separation is crucial to later arguments, so I\u2019d like to unpack it a bit further. Let\u2019s say that two people, Alice and Bob, lived together in an early tribe of homo sapiens sapiens. They use their memories to keep track of their history of reciprocity (i.e. how many nice things have we done for one another in the past?). One day, Bob approaches Alice, who\u2019s lounging comfortably on her favorite geologically-manufactured recliner eating some of the berries she found earlier in the day. Bob didn\u2019t have quite so much luck, and is feeling rather peckish. Let\u2019s assume he makes this obvious to Alice using the communicative tools of the era. Does Alice comply? Assuming Bob isn\u2019t too big of a jerk, he likely believes that he\u2019s done something in the past to warrant some berries now, despite his present bad luck. But for Alice to agree, she must also possess a correspondingly positive mental recollection of their shared history. And given no physical record, it must align quite closely to the subjective recollection held in Bob\u2019s memory. If they don\u2019t match, Alice should refuse the request.\n\nRelying solely upon human memory and momentary incentives presents a substantial barrier to exchange. For Alice\u2019s donation to feel fair, both Alice and Bob\u2019s subjective perceptions \u2014 past and present \u2014 must possess a high degree of overlap. In engineering terms, to maintain the capacity for reciprocity, the subjective realities of Alice and Bob must remain tightly coupled over time. To understand the fragility of this system, it\u2019s useful to meditate upon how many ways this might go wrong. How many ways can Alice and Bob\u2019s realities decouple \u2014 or decohere \u2014 over time? Alice and Bob\u2019s memory can vary. Alice and Bob may value past interactions differently. New information may have entered the picture since their last interaction. Alice might be particularly hungry. Bob may be having a bad hair day. The list goes on and on.\n\nThat being said, if the exchange does occur, it reaffirms that Alice and Bob\u2019s subjective perceptions of reality have remained in synchrony with one another. Psychologically, they\u2019re still living in the same world. They\u2019ve remained coherent over time, and still exist within the fertile interpersonal soil of shared reality from which bonds of trust may grow. And by strengthening their bond, they also strengthen the overall coherence of the community to which they belong. This strengthening of communal coherence is of great import, though it\u2019s often difficult to understand, measure, or encode its value in the present, given that it mostly pays dividends in the future. The invisible bonds of trust \u2014 of communal coherence \u2014 return compounding dividends as the collective iterates these interpersonal interactions hundreds, thousands, or millions of times. In other words, a society that nurtures trust increases the probability of favorable interpersonal exchange outcomes over time. A trusting society can extend its conceptual time horizon, and plan accordingly, together as one meta-organism.\n\nBut as the size \u2014 and by extension the complexity \u2014 of a society grows, it becomes impossible to maintain such high degrees of interpersonal coherence over time. Trust begins to erode. A growing community generates a combinatorial explosion of new possibilities, and this increasingly diverse set of life paths widens the gap between the subjective realities of community members, creating tension between individual interactions that depend on the coherent communal reality of the meta-organism. Something has to give, or chaos and violence will arise. And so, humanity externalized methods for keeping itself coherent with respect to its shared history of value, exchange, and reciprocal debts as it continued to expand across the planet. These new tools enabled humans to outsource the burden of maintaining communal coherence to physical systems existing outside individual brains. By encoding shared reality within a capable substitute, outside the vagaries of subjective reality, humanity established a shared environmental reality; in other words, we planted behavioral seeds that would later grow into the explicitly articulated concept of \u201cobjective reality\u201d. We had to act it out before we could conceptualize it, and we had to conceptualize it before we could speak of it.\n\nExamples of these proto-monetary accounting systems (such as the quipu pictured at the outset of this section) represent the first physical manifestations of collective human intelligence. Thus, by outsourcing the social coherence problem mentioned earlier to shared objective space, we allowed each member of society more freedom to explore, develop, and differentiate their own subjective interpretation of the world. We lowered the costs of individuation, and therefore opened a new frontier of cognitive exploration allowing for the expansion of individual identity. More importantly, we opened this fecund frontier without also opening the floodgates of chaos characterized by the erosion of social cohesion and trust. In balance, both the individual and the collective meta-organism thrived. Alice and Bob no longer needed to possess nearly identical internal mappings of reality to derive the benefits of exchange. For all intents and purposes, this was a win-win \u2014 or positive sum \u2014 outcome. Alice and Bob benefited individually from increased cognitive and economic freedom, and the collective social organism benefitted from a coherent, mostly stable explosion of creativity and growth."

        "text": "You probably don\u2019t think about the warranty on your oven or refrigerator all that often.\n\nThat is, until something goes wrong. Then you start frantically paging through the warranty to see whether or not you\u2019re covered.\n\nIt should be a simple process to determine if your warranty will save you from paying for repairs. But the warranty industry\u2019s supply chain has a number of issues and inefficiencies that roadblock this process for both companies and consumers.\n\nFalse claims, fake products, and confusion about coverage are some of the most common issues companies face. And these are passed on to consumers in the form of tedious processes and poor customer experiences.\n\nBut there is a better way for warranty companies to verify claims. Blockchain has the potential to help streamline the industry by securing supply chains and providing track-and-trace capabilities for products under warranty.\n\nMost people feel as though they\u2019re getting the runaround when they process a claim.\n\nThey spend hours on the phone trying fruitlessly to prove their issue is covered. But warranty claims are much trickier than many imagine.\n\nWarranty companies are in a constant battle, trying to avoid paying fraudulent claims on products or issues they don\u2019t cover. And counterfeit products entering the supply chain add an extra layer of complexity to their job.\n\nMuch of the trouble comes from information gaps between manufacturers, distributors, warranty companies, and consumers.\n\nA clear reason for these gaps is lack of consumer insight. Most warranties are located somewhere in the back of a thick booklet of product information and directions. They often require the consumer to fill out a form and mail it back to the manufacturer.\n\nBut the vast majority of people never do, and that creates a major information gap. The manufacturer doesn\u2019t know for certain where their products are ending up. They only know which distributors they sell to.\n\nAnd because the manufacturer can\u2019t follow the paths their products take, the warranty company has no way of knowing whether the product they\u2019re covering is the real thing.\n\nUsing a serial number or a tamper-proof cryptographic seal, companies can track the progress of a product from the manufacturer to the consumer. They can verify through immutable blockchain-based proofs that the product has moved on to the wholesaler, retailer, and consumer.\n\nSo when a product is manufactured, the manufacturer creates a record of it on blockchain. As the product moves through the supply chain, it is verified and recorded at each touchpoint until a consumer buys it.\n\nWhen a customer calls in about the product, the warranty company is able to check the record to see if there is proven path from the manufacturer all the way to the consumer. If so, they have proof the product they\u2019re paying a claim for is authentic.\n\nRemoving counterfeits protects the manufacturer\u2019s brand and the distributor\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe warranty company is protected from fraudulent claims on counterfeit items. The retailer has an additional value proposition in their pitch to upsell customers on a warranty. And the consumer can be sure they\u2019re getting the real thing.\n\nOnce the supply chain is secure and product identities are registered to blockchain, warranty claim resolutions will happen in seconds.\n\nLet\u2019s say I buy a refrigerator. I flip through the thick instruction packet that comes with it, fill out the warranty, and register my fridge. Or the registration can happen automatically at the point of sale. For the next year, all is well.\n\nSuddenly, my fridge won\u2019t cool. So, I call the warranty company and submit my claim. With a blockchain system, the person who answers my call can immediately check whether or not my product is covered based on its blockchain identity. They simply look up the serial number to check the product\u2019s record and verify the warranty.\n\nAnd if they\u2019re not sure whether my specific problem is covered under the warranty, they can send a service person to my home. Once the problem is diagnosed, the repair technician can immediately pull out a phone that links to the blockchain system and check whether my issue is covered under the warranty.\n\nAlthough this is a simple version of the workings behind the process, blockchain will provide some much-needed visibility into the supply chain for warranty companies.\n\nCoupled with the ability to weed out counterfeits, this system will greatly reduce the time and money spent identifying fraudulent claims."
