        "title": "Noob\u2019s guide on Information Theory of Convolution Neural Nets",
        "text": "Machine Learning has been around for a while now and we are all aware of its impact in solving everyday problems. Initially, it was about solving simple problems of statistics, but it has grown much beyond that and can now solve even bigger problems like image recognition.But have you ever wondered about the pace at which this transition has occurred. It has now reached a point where it can actually distinguish a cat from a dog. In this series, we will explore the nature of such networks, and how to manipulate information represented through the network to solve some of the toughest problems around image recognition.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the scratch. Let\u2019s say we have input vectors \u2014 specifications of a house, and outputs like the price of the house. For let\u2019s not worry much about the details and just visualize this as though we have information described in a set of concepts(kitchen size, number of floors, location) and we need to represent information pertinent to another set of concepts (price of house, architecture quality etc). This is basically conversion from one conceptual representation to another conceptual representation. Now think how a human would have solved it ?\n\nHe (say Alex) would probably have a mathematical way to convert this from one conceptual representation to another through some \u2018if-else\u2019 condition to start off. If he (say Bob) was slightly smarter, he would have converted input concepts into some intermediary scores like simplicity, floor quality, noise in the neighbourhood, etc. And he would also cleverly map these scores to the corresponding final output, say price of the house. If you see what has changed from noob real estate agent(Alex) to a slightly smarter real estate agent (Bob) is that he mapped input-output information flow in detail. In other words, he changed the framework in which he thought he could best represent the underlying architecture.\n\nSo the difference between Alex and Bob\u2019s thought process was that Bob could figure out that secondary concepts are easy to calculate and he can combine them to represent the final desired output whereas Alex tried to write an entire \u2018if-else\u2019 logic for each one of the input variables and mapped it with each one of the output variables. Bob in a way represented the same mapping in a more systematic way by breaking them into smaller concepts and just had to remember fewer concepts. Meanwhile, Alex had to remember how every input is connected to every output without breaking it into smaller concepts. So the big lesson here is that the framework of thinking is everything.\n\nThis is what most researchers have realized. Every researcher has the same problem, let\u2019s say cat vs dog image. They too have to convert information from one conceptual representation (pixels) to another conceptual representation (is-cat is True/False).They also have almost the same computational power(memory, complexity etc), hence the only way to solve this problem is to introduce the framework of thinking that decodes inputs with minimum resources and converts it from one form to another. You would\u2019ve already heard about a lot of \u2018frameworks of thinking\u2019. When people say Convolutional Networks, it simply means \u2014 it is a framework of representing a particular mapping function. Most statistical models that predict house prices are also just mapping functions. They all try to best predict a universal mapping function from input to output\n\nCNN(Convolution Neural Networks) are a form of functions that uses some concepts around images \u2014 like positional invariance. That means the network can re-use the same sub mapping function from the bottom part of the image to the top part of the image. This essentially reduces the number of parameters in which the Universal Mapping function can be represented. This is why CNNs are cone shaped. Here we move from concepts that are space oriented (pixels) to concepts that are space independent (cat-or-not, has-face). That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple. Information is smartly converted from one form to another.\n\nRecent advancements in Neuroscience has essentially said the same thing regarding how we decode the information in the visual cortex. We first decode lines, then decode objects like boxes, circles, curves etc, then decode them into faces, headphones etc.\n\nA lot of Machine Learning/Deep Learning/AI technologies have very simple conceptual frameworks but the reason behind it solving mammoth problems lies in the complexity that arises from a whole lot of simple-conceptual-frameworks that are attached end-to-end. It is so complex that we can\u2019t really predict whether these networks can solve any kind of problem. Yet, we have been implementing them on a day to day basis based on some sort of assumption. It\u2019s very similar to the human brain. We know its underlying structure and framework. We discovered it half a century ago. Yet, we\u2019ve not been able to decipher this complex world and we are still unsure as to when we\u2019ll reach such an understanding."

Re-tweets from hate speech is converted into donations for an organisation countering hate, called \u2018Life After Hate\u2019. They have teamed up with Spredfast to train AI to identify Twitter trolls. Once the AI detects the hateful speech, a human moderator steps in with the right response.\n\nMachine learning analyzes thousands of tweets and identifies hateful ones in seconds. Enterprise level AI platforms for natural language processing and image recognition APIs review and interpret tweets in real time. Spredfast, the intelligent social listening platform then classifies it into streams of hate speech. These streams are fed into machines to understand human languages and learn better."

It ensures the authenticity of products, blocking availability of counterfeit products. Blockchain also helps locate stolen items and protects customers and retailers from any kind of fraudulent transactions. For the second hand market of luxury goods, blockchain becomes a good means of authenticating their products. Adoption of blockchain can help the second hand goods market garner more trust from customers by reducing the no:of counterfeit products.\n\nFor a vendor to sell a designer product, he has to produce a cryptographically signed digital asset issued by the original retailer. Blockchain adds digital cash to a customer\u2019s wallet that can be used to make a purchase.\n\nBlockchain also impacts supply chain and makes it more transparent. In today\u2019s times, consumers are increasingly concerned about the quality of the food and the sources from where they procure food. Blockchain technology allows transparent recording and takes care of all other compliance. There are companies running such systems to promote environmentally sustainable production and social good.\n\nRecently in China, Blockchain technology helped in fighting the fake goods market.\n\nOnce something is stored in the blockchain, it cannot be changed, and so this makes the blockchain a proof of existence.\n\nA database of the information that needs to be stored is pegged to the blockchain by encrypted signatures that can be validated against a transaction.\n\nRetail shops can also benefit from the blockchain by using it as a tracking system for inventory, and also using it to audit information on customer transactions.\n\nThe ownership and transfer of blockchain currencies, connected to a particular outlet can indicate the health of a store."

        "text": "With the advancement of machine learning and the advent of deep learning, several tools and graphical representations were introduced to co relate the huge chunks of data. Deep Belief Networks are a graphical representation which are essentially generative in nature i.e. it generates all possible values which can be generated for the case at hand. It is an amalgamation of probability and statistics with machine learning and neural networks. Deep Belief Networks consist of multiple layers with values, wherein there exists a relation between the layers but not the values. The main aim is to help the system classify the data into different categories.\n\nThe First Generation Neural Networks used Perceptrons which identified a particular object or anything else by taking into consideration oits \u201cweight\u201d or pre-fed properties. However the Perceptrons could only be effective at a more basic level and not in advance technology. To solve these issues, the Second Generation of Neural Networks saw the introduction of the concept of Backpropagation in which the received output is compared with the desired output and the error value is reduced to zero. Support Vector Machines created and understood more test cases by referring to previously input test cases. Next came directed acyclic graphs called belief networks which helped in solving problems related to inference and learning problems. This was followed by Deep Belief Networks which helped to create unbiased values to be stored in leaf nodes.\n\nDeep Belief Networks are composed of unsupervised networks like RBMs. In this the invisible layer of each sub network is the visble layer of the next. The hidden or invisible layers are not connected to each other and are conditionally independent. The probability of a joint configuration network over both visible and hidden layers depends on the joint configuration network\u2019s energy compared with the energy of all other joint configuration networks.\n\nThe first step is to train a layer of properties which can obtain the input signals from the pixels directly. The next step is to treat the values of this layer as pixels and learn the features of the previously obtained features in a second hidden layer. Every time another layer of properties or features is added to the belief network, there will be an improvement in the lower bound on the log probability of the training dataset.\n\nMATLAB can easily represent visible layer, hidden layers and weights as matrices and execute algorithms efficiently. Hence, we choose MATLAB to implement DBN. These handwritten digits of MNIST9 are then used to perform calculations in order to compare the performance against other classifiers. The MNIST9 can be described as a database of handwritten digits. There are 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of digits. The handwritten digits are from 0 to 9 and are available in various shapes and positions for each and every image. Each of them is normalized and centered in 28x28 pixels and are labeled. The methods to decide how often these weights are updated are \u2014 mini batch,onlie and full-batch. Online learning takes the longest computation time because its updates weights after each training data instance. Full-batch goes through the training data and updates weights, however, it is not advisable to use it for big datasets. Mini-batch divides a dataset into smaller bits of data and performs the learning operation for every chunk. This method takes less computation time. Hence, we use mini-batch learning for implementation.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that implementing a Deep Belief Network demands training each layer of RBM. For this purpose, the units and parameters are first initialized. It is followed by two phases in Contrastive Divergence algorithm \u2014 positive and negative. In the positive phase, the binary states of the hidden layers can be obtained by calculating the probabilities of weights and visible units. Since it is increases the probability of the training dataset, it is called positive phase. The negative phase decreases the probability of samples generated by the model. The greedy learning algorithm is used to train the entire Deep Belief Network. The greedy learning algorithm trains one RBM at a time and until all the RBMs have been taught."

Businesses are willing to invest in three main areas \u2014 human resources, food products, and customer experiences, and they are continuing to explore more possibilities to boost processes.\n\nChanging customer experience with interactive marketing has helped brands scale. Events like the Museum of Icecream and 29 rooms have convinced many brands in apportioning ad dollars to sponsorships and experiences. AR & VR has helped improve consumer interest by activating all senses. F&B events have gained a lot from VR experiences. Creating shareable content and augmenting the physical world has been the focus of AR in experiential marketing. Keeping visual experience at the core of it all, brands have realized the value of AR & VR to educate and incite customers. This drives interest and purchase decision.\n\nWhen the product content extends beyond its physical place, and becomes more interactive and engaging, it can influence customers. AR bridges the gap between customer, product and product content. Visual interactions on top of products helps connect the visual world with the real one seamlessly. Technology can be used to educate consumers on different aspects of products like \u2014 the nutritional information, product composition and so on.\n\nBrands like Walmart and Kraft have experimented with AR backed summer sweepstakes to sell more Kraft products. Nestle used a character from the movie Rio for an AR game. More brands are adapting to new and improved methods of reaching out to their customer base in unique and interactive ways."

This shows the growing adoption of same day delivery. This has also led to a jump in demand for international products which points to the importance of improving cross border delivery.\n\nAI powered conversational interfaces can answer questions, and work as human chat support with voice-based shopping. Imagine walking into a store and just using your voice to ask the store app to get your product, and not just that, if the app also has the feature to tell you where exactly the product is on the store map. How convenient would that be?\n\nSince the way users shop is changing on a daily basis, the way shopping is done also must change accordingly. Curating boxes of personally picked items can improve shopping experience and convert more customers.\n\nAutonomous vehicles are already being test driven to meet the growing consumer demand for real time delivery. This can help boost retail traffic in urban areas."
